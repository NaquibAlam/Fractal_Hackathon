I spent half an hour talking to two customer service agents, the first said she would call me back in an hour (it was 8 hours ago), and the other promised that it would be solved by yesterday.\nRynair charges 45 EUR for airport check-in which is more than half of my return flight. Am I supposed to pay this because of your incompetence and unresponsiveness? I would have needed to check in yesterday because I don't have access to printer today. This is absurd, please figure this out or refund me for my return flight plus all the money I spent on talking to customer service on the phone (adding up another half of my return flight).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:54:31.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

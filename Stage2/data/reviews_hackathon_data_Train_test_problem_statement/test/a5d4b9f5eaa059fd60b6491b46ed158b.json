Chairs come completely apart and you must put together with multi size Allen wrenches. The chairs are constantly needing tightening on the arms, foot rests, since day 1! I called about a chair doing a wobble, clients felt like they were on a boat, even sent a video. I was told to take the base apart of the faulty chair and a good chair and swap out the hydraulic and the base to figure out what part was defective. I did not do this because I was afraid to ruin 2 chairs. I am now looking for 7 new styling chairs. I will be making sure most of the product is put together for durability. It's a bit embarrassing that a client is worried about my wobbly arms. I worry that the main attachment in the back of the chair is getting worn out from constant tightening and will break as a client is entering or exiting the styling chair... then I will be left with no functioning chair! Very disappointing!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:11:56.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

And I'm left having to swallow a scandalous loss of my own money for items that were likely never even sent to me.\nCustomer service is a shame . Its either a computer system set up to answer any \"key words\" that you type. Or its another clever way to hide the reason of having to hire people from a foreign country to communicate with American customer issues.\nI don't know but what I do know is that I'm left feeling so frustrated and unsatisfied with the services. That purchasing anytime in future doesn't look likely. Having to pay an extra $5.00 doesn't seem so bad if the services hold true to their word", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:41:20.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

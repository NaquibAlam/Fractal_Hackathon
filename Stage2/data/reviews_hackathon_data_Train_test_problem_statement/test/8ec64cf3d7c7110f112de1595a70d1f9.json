After today's experience I will now have to give this company 1 star. One set of the lenses were not in stock. I requested that they simply ship what they had in stock and refund me what they did not currently have. 2 messages later and a phone call from them, my simple instructions were still not carried out. They kept explaining that they will order it and ship it to me in 8-10 days. On the phone i actually canceled my whole order and even agreed to pay the 10% restocking fee (for a product they didnt have). 1H later my order was processed and shipped. I then received another email stating that the items were \"already shipped\". It is truly amazing how fast it happened after the employee said he could cancel the order. I was again being asked if i could wait for the lenses not in stock!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T13:59:29.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The arrangement was not similar and there were no purple flowers (only a few different colored substitutes), way less flowers than what was shown PLUS greenery put in with FERNS! There were no ferns in the pictured arrangement! The flowers were not arranged at all like what I paid for. I paid EXTRA for delivery by 1pm and it didn't get there till 4pm. The said they'd refund the delivery upgrade but didn't. Then when I saw a photo of the arrangement she got VS the one I ordered, I called them. They leave me on hold for over an hour or hang up with me! Do not order with these guys. They are not in your neighborhood. They use other crappy florists that don't give you what you ordered. I will be filing with the BBB and FTD. Order #3983522 and photos available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:01:34.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Booked a flight through flight hub, they contact me later that evening saying it was cancelled because of credit card issue. No problem, rebooked again for the flight next morning. Early next morning get another email saying flight was cancelled once again due to airfare changes after I already booked flight for set price. They contact saying they want more money??! What a joke this website is... had no other option at the time had to get to my destination so agreed to pay the extra when we were rebooking once again, they then say the flight is unavailable all together. Had to book a later flight that day... booked right through West Jet and was taken care of right away. Because of my experience though and later flight I was help up in Toronto for 2 days because of weather... I know fellow colleagues who were on the morning flight who made it to the destination on time. Because of flighthub I missed my opportunity to get on that flight all due to horrible organization and poor service. Garbage service will never use again!! Recommend to nobody, I will be letting people know about my experience with this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:01:11.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

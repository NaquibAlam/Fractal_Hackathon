Supposed to be leaving in 4 days. I email'd the hotel yesterday about something minor only to be told that \"There is a problem with my booking\" but that they can't tell me what because I didn't book it direct with them. Called lastminute.com and they said they don't see a problem but they would look into it and get back to me.\nAs you can imagine, having saved for years and spent thousand of pounds, now with the prospect of landing in Orlando at midnight with a small child and without a hotel to go to, I am incredibly stressed wondering if our holiday will be ruined. I suspect my lasting memory of this holiday will be the panic and worry the week before and that's assuming we even get to go. I'll update this review with what happens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:09:48.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

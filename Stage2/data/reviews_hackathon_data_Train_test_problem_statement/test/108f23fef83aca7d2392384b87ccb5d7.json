It sat in transit for two weeks at a location for no reason of why it wasn't being delivered. I called to ask what the problem is and they claim that I had to call to setup a delivery. Isn't that their job? So I call to schedule a date. Still no bed and we're now 01/2017.\nTwice now the shipping company has no called and no showed for delivery and failed to call to reschedule for two weeks. So now I have been waiting an extra month for my bed because no one wants to do their job. I am extremely disappointed. I'm glad shipping is free because they don't deserve a dime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:03:55.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

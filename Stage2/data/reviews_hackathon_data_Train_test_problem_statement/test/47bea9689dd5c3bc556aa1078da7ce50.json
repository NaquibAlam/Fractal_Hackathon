I ordered from Avas flowers initially because I thought they were a local florist where my sister lives. Turns out their website just picks up whatever city you google, making it look like they are local.- they are NOT.\n2. I ordered a flowering plant basket, delux, with a card and balloon for delivery on my sister's birthday - a MONDAY.\n3. I received a call telling me that they had no designer available for the basket but they would upgrade my order to 24 roses and would add in a box of chocolates. I said OK.\n4. Then I received another call telling me my order was processed and would be delivered Saturday (!) to insure it would be there for her birthday.\n5. Despite multiple calls to the company, they said they could not change the delivery date because the order was already at UPS (!) which is how I realized they were not local. I did not want the flowers delivered early because I wanted them to arrive as a surprise for her birthday on her actual birthday.\n6. Turns out the roses were delivered Saturday - upside down!!! - and my sister was away for the weekend. When she returned home Sunday evening to find the upside down bow, flowers wilting, the chocolates but no balloon!!\nI will NEVER, EVER order from these people again. This has been the worst ordering experience I have ever had - and I am over 60!! I've also never written a review like this before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:50:03.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

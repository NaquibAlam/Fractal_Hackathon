The day I drove the car off the lot there were issues with the vehicle. I had to bring the vehicle back to have some work done to the drive axle. November comes and goes, payments made on time, everybody happy. December comes and goes, payments made on time, everybody happy.\nJanuary comes in with a bang. I'm driving down Interstate 95 in Woodbridge, VA when all the warning lights starts coming on and the engine dies. I called the warranty company Aaverix they told me to have the vehicle towed to Pep Boys. I did. Pep Boys said hey we can't fix this. There is engine problems, air bag problems, and motor problems. So Aaverix approved to have the vehicle worked on by the Buick dealership. The dealership said the engine had to be replaced with a long laundry list of other items to get the vehicle back to safe operation again.\nThe dealership contact Aaverix. Aaverix said we will only pay for the engine and thats all. I called Drive Time and they told me they would cover the cost of the rest of the repairs or I can get another vehicle. I said ok. Great! I went to the dealership to try to find a vehicle that was similar to mine. There were none. I couldn't go to a smaller vehicle, it just would not meet my needs. So i agreed to keep the vehicle, if they repair. So during this time I had to rent a SUV to keep my life going which Aaverix was not reimbursing me for, which came to almost 200 a week. So the engine was ordered and it was put in, but when the dealer put it in there were other issues with the motor that was preventing it from running correctly. I called Drive Time customer relations and spoke with another lady and she said they would not be covering the cost that they would only cover 70% and I would be responsible for the rest. HERE WE GO AGAIN!! Of course this made me furious. I went on and on about how they just told me 2 weeks ago they would cover everything. She eventually put me on hold and came back and said yes I'm sorry, we will cover the cost and we will wave this current payment. Ok Great! she said but since the engine is in the car can you have it towed back to Pep Boys, because they can do the work cheaper. I said fine.\nNow we are on week 4 of not having my vehicle. Everyday the collections dept. calls me looking for a payment. I tell them they need to call Customer Relations and I haven't driven the vehicle in over a month. So now Pep Boys have the vehicle again. They get the car running and only fix the items related to the engine and nothing else. They tell me to come pick up the vehicle. I get there and the ABS light is still on, \"Service Stabilitrak\" Service TPMS\" \"Service Airbag\"\"Service All Wheel Drive\". So at this point I'm furious as to why they call me and the car is not fixed. They advised me Averix said to only fix the engine and thats it. So at this point I call my attorney, and give him the details. He advise me to call back to try and get it fixed if they decline then we could look at court. So Pep Boys call Aaverix and they said they will cover the axle if I pay another deductible. Umm HELL NO!. If you told me to come get the car and you knew it was still messed up, I will not pay another one. So today I called back Customer Relations and they said they would wave the deductible. Which let me know that DriveTime, Aaverix, and Bridgecrest is the same damn company. When I mentioned about the 1 payment they would wave she told me no, that was not in the notes. I'm fed up. I don't have the energy to fight with the LIARS ANYMORE. I WILL JUST COUGH IT UP AND I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON. If you are looking for a vehicle. Please, Please, Please take my advice. Go elsewhere. It is not worth the headache and worry of these LIARS. I'm in the process of trying to trade this car and go with another company.. SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE AND STRESS.\nUpdate 3/17/17-", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T15:21:14.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

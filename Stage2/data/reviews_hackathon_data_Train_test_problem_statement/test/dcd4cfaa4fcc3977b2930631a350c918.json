They claimed to have found an amazing internet/tv combo that was as as cheap as buying internet alone. If the deal had went through it would have been.\nAfter 2 credit checks , 2 charges to my debit card I thought I was done after almost 2 hours on the phone. I got transferred to a different person to verify my appointment for the internet installation. She then claimed the order didn't go all the way through and needed another credit check. I asked to be transferred back to the original person , and she sent out me in hold then after 45 mins someone answered and claimed that they had no information about any of my purchases and that I couldn't be found. Now I have tv and the internet company says the internet sold to me isn't available at my house.\nVery upset, called in 2 days in a row and nobody has any info on my orders or any record of me even calling in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T09:20:41.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

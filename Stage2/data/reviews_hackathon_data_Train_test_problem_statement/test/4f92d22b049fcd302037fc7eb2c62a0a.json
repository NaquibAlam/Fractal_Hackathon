After clicking on the item i wanted, it would say it was out of stock, when I KNOW it is not. I had to click on a different size then click BACK to my size to be able to add it to the cart. it said it was successfully added to the cart so i hit \"cont. shopping\" to my horror, my cart was empty... i repeated this process countless times until finally i discovered the loophole. you have to click on your remaining points, THEN click on the cart. This is a very frustrating experience and something i do not want to have to partake in every time i make a rewards purchase. I finally got it so dont worry, just something to look out for.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:58:38.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

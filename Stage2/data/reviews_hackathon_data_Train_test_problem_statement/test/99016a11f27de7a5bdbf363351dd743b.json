After the 2nd deposit of Ethereum he has been blocked for using my card on the first one. Which they could have blocked, using the right tool on their website. I have seen it on other website who block the name for credit card paiement not allowing you to use somebody else card.\nWas this tool to expensive to put on your website?\nOr was it to keep the money of those who make this mistake?\nSince that, no news. They keep his money apparently.\nThey did not explain anything to him. They just blocked him and kept his money so far.\nHe sent 20 emails the last month, with no answer.\nBe careful don't make mistake or they close your account and may ? keep your money.\nGlad it wasn't 1000€ !!!\nUPDATE:\nOk. I understood that. It is not authorized to use a third party card. And I have NO PROBLEM with it. YOU are right.\nIt is his mistake. And mine.\nBUT.\nWhat about using technology, and block the name of the user (Cf. His account name) when he makes a deposit with a Credit card.\nLike this he is not allowed to put the name he wants. there is ONLY his name. He only have to put his credit card numbers and date. that is it.\n(Like other site do when appropriate)\nThat would block anybody from using a third party card.\nAnd PROBLEM RESOLVE.\nIs it too complicated? Others websites are doing it.\nPLUS.\nWhat about the money? The deposits.\nI didn't check if I have been refund the 20€ on my Credit Card. I will.\nBut I am sure he didn't have is 2 Ethereum back. Yet.\nDo you keep the money when people make a mistake? Maybe not..\nUPDATE2\nSolution maybe on his way. Thank you Support team and thank you Craig.\nWe will see. I'll keep you inform.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T14:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T09:45:21.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

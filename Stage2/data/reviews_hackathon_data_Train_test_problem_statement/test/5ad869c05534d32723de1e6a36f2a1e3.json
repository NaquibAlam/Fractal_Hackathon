I called on one day, and Attorney Levi Hoyes explained everything to me, took my information, called me back, emailed me all the forms and requirements the next day. I applied and submitted documents and Mr. Hoyes had everything processed in a day or two. He answered all of my questions and guided me the best way to achieve satisfaction. This was a very positive experience! I very highly recommend this company for their expertise, fast response and immense professionalism.\nMy rating is 5 on a 5 scale!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:09:48.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

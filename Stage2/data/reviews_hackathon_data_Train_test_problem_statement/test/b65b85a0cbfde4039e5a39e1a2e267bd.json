I've had the same experience as others - they charged me $149 for a six-month membership but the charge didn't show up on my ancestry.com account until it was too late to cancel for a refund; the only results I've ever gotten on their site is about the same member of my family, over and over; and they never notified me that they received my DNA test but that it hadn't been activated (I thought I had activated it the day I got it but apparently something went wrong). They had my test for three months but never bothered to contact me (but sent me tons of email advertisements for their services). Their website makes it very difficult to find contact information but I finally found a phone number and sat on hold for over 20 minutes before being answered but the person wouldn't listen to me (it took him 3 tries to even get my email correct) and was no help - even though he looked at my account he still didn't tell me the kit wasn't activated). I finally did an online search that led to a customer service email and got a reply with a link to a customer service form, which I filled out and got a snotty reply to but still no refund. I will never do business with them again. If you want a DNA test, do it somewhere else. And don't pay for a membership - it's worthless. (and don't bother with your stupid \"we're sorry for your experience\" reply - I just want a refund)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T13:56:55.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

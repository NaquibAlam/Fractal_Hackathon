In short, I arrived for a front end alignment and a slow leak repair. Due to the sharp eye of my technician, a hairline crack was found in my rim. This was a good find. Instead of repairing the crack, I felt it best to replace all four rims. The desk clerk then located four displays at a good price. I purchased them and was informed by yet another clerk that they could be put on later that afternoon – despite the growing number of customers arriving. I agreed and waited for his confirmation call. It came and I returned to Town Fair.\nUpon my techs completion of attaching my new rims with my old tires, I overheard him mention something to my desk clerk regarding a turning issue. Unsure if this was related to my vehicle or not, I waited for the desk clerk to make mention of it. He did not. Therefore I didn't think it was related to me. He then slid a document in front of me and said after I checked out the rims he'd like me to sign the document - “a waiver.” The waiver stated that once I signed it, the work done was mine and I could not do anything about it afterwards. First, I've never been asked to sign a document at Town Fair. Second, based on the fact I've never had an issue with Town Fair, I signed the document upon visually inspecting my new rims. Upon departure, my tires rubbed up against my forward fender with a quarter turn of the wheel. This was what the Tech had mentioned and this was not relayed to me. This appeared to be an underhanded move. I returned to the desk and the desk clerk suggested I drive the vehicle back to the maintenance bays in the back of the building.\nUpon my arrival, my technician approached and considered the problem. He then assessed the problem. The manager then came out and suggested that “I” could file the fender well back, or apply washers to the bolts pulling up on the loose fender. He claimed that he had other customers waiting and that he could not do anything about it.\nDuring this time, while he was on his back, under my car, I stood watch for on coming traffic in the lot and noticed another technician in a customers vehicle peeling out, driving recklessly between the parking spaces in an angered rush to enter the bay. (Closing time was upon them.)\nI ignored this technician and concluded my “Put Off” with the manager. I was not happy with the transfer of the problem.\nAs I pulled away, the “angry tech” shouted at me - “Figure it out, fagat.”\nI slammed on my brakes and shouted out - “Are you talking to me?” He didn't answer – having been surprised I heard him. I addressed him again – he still ignored me. He appeared angered and was pushing things around for his next assignment. From another bay, another tech shouted out - “He's not talking to you.”\nI looked around and found no one else in the parking lot near me or behind me and thought it best to leave.\nThe \"angry tech\" is described as a white male, slender, dark hair, age, twenty something and worked close to the center bay.\nI'll not return to Town Fair. They have soiled their reputation with me.\nDaniel Whitney (Former customer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T07:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T09:34:59.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

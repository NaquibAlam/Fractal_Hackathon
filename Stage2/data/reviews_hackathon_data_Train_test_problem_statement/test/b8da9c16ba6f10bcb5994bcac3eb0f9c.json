With that being said I purchased 2 items assuming they were the right parts for my vechicle since I typed them in on their search engine. Turns out both parts were wrong. So on top of me paying high *** shipping they telling me through (email) that if I return the items it would be deducted from what I paid bs. Had spoken with someone before I confirmed my purchase none of this would've never happened! Oh btw the website wouldn't even let me use my 10% coupon. I'm telling every person thinking about using them think twice!

Could not answer why all prior orders shipped with no problem. Refused to refund the freight charge even after I phoned UPS and they indicated it was the shippers problem with paperwork Person online did not care. Told them I was going to refuse the shipment and they types that they would bill my credit card for all costs for the return and restocking.\nWill never buy from them again, spent over $20,000 last year for my business and they could not care less. So be it will find someone else to spend my budget with this year.\nHenry You should check the facts and understand the UPS process before replying, because what you are stating is incorrect. The paperwork from your drop ship partner was not correct. IF the paperwork was correct there would be no need for contact and there would have been no delay. Also at the end UPS contacted the SHIPPER to resolve this. See UPS comment from waybill \"POWER OF ATTORNEY PAPERWORK IS MISSING AND IS REQUIRED FOR CLEARANCE\" Reading a bunch of reviews and appear B&H has an inability to admit when they make a mistake. Guess customer is always WORNG with your company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T21:00:15.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

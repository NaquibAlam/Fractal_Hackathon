Upon inquiring was told the shoe was backordered till March.\nSurprise - it shipped in Feb. Great. But then ONE MONTH LATER - I still hadn't received anything. So back to their order page. Finally found some obscure page saying the order was returned due to customs. What they didn't understand US customs before they \"shipped\" the shoes???\nOh, and to top it off, they want to give me a credit on their website so I can order something else... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!\nNow I see they gave me a credit... of $8.00 of the $39.00 they charged for shoes that I will NEVER get.\nAnd please do not reply to this review LightInTheBox - there is nothing you can say (or your worthless customer service can do) to make this up to me or the kid that was getting the shoes.\nThe Worst!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:57:28.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

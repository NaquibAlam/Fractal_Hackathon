We were asked whether it was from the central heating system or hot/cold water pipes. We didn't know. British Gas sent out Dyno (the plumbing side of British Gas) who visually looked at the ceilings, told us it was the central heating pipes, to keep the boiler off but ok for mains water to be on and they would be back in the morning. Next morning, my child switched her light on before we realised water was pouring out of the light switch and water was leaking above my other child's bed. We turned water and electrics off but water was still leaking down. We phoned up British Gas and were told it maybe several hours before they could get to us. We got a private plumber out who poked out the wet ceiling to reveal a pinhole water leak in the cold pipe (between jobs so they couldn't stay). British Gas man then appeared but he said he had to recall Dyno as it was a water pipe not a central heating pipe. Dyno man then came round and said it was an unsleeved pipe so we weren't covered. How do we know if our pipes hidden under the wall are sleeved or unsleeved? The house was built in 1996 and it was normal to fit pipes this way (apparently several years later they started to be sleeved according to a buildings reg company I know). We asked if he could do anything to help. He said he could cap the pipe but it wouldn't make any difference because of where the pipe was situated. I asked how is it we pay Â£33 a month and you can't even leave us with running water? He shrugged. We have had Homecare ( Central Heating and Plumbing) since 2000 and realise we have paid for a service that can't even leave our family with running water. Obviously we have had no working toilets, electrics in the bedrooms or water for 2 nights/ two days until we found an emergency plumber. British Gas have been worse than not having them. Due to their incompetence we now have more water damage in our house and potentially put our family in a dangerous situation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:09:02.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

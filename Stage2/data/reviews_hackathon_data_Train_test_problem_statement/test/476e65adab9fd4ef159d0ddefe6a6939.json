And when I was filling up form there was no any connection to booking.com, just simple standard form. So I was confused when I received confirmation email with booking.com logo.\n2) When I book on booking.com there always cancelation options are highlighted and explained. On you website there is a grey label \"NO REFUND\" aside another grey label \"PAY LATER\" which is confusing. I had to please booking.com to cancel my booking without payment for cancelation.

My wife had her hair cut at Rush on Baker Street and she recommended I try them on the basis that even if it doesn't work out I'm never more than five weeks from the next haircut. I called late on a Friday and got to see Erica on the following Sunday. I was greeted by a friendly receptionist who took my coat and offered a drink. Erica discussed my hair with me and asked how I liked it. She backwashed my hair and gave me a superb haircut using only scissors. When she finished she explained what she had done and asked if I was happy. I was more than happy, I was delighted. If you are looking for great service and superb haircut somewhere in central London I can recommend Rush on Baker Street.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:58:34.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

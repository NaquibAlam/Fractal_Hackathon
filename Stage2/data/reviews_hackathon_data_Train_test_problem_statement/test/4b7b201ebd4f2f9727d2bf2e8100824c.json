It has taken 5 Days with 2 being the weekend. my Credit rating is almost as good as it can be (top 15% of Australia) And Everything they asked for I provided within 10 minutes of them asking/emailing.\nThe problem is now. I was consolidating some loans. however because its been so long. the amount's have changed and I am sick of dealing with them. so asking for even corrections to the loan amount will just delay things further I feel.\nThe application process is cumbersome, not intuitive. the application is so vague you are told to sign documents, with a link. yet it just takes you to the status page.\nSite promises \"flexible payment arrangements\" however I couldn't nominate an account of my choosing.\nInstead\nWhen you submit your bank statements. there is an explicit notice saying \"we don't record your bank details\" Yet when I go to complete my Loan they magically have the BSB acct number from them\nDocument and ID uploading is just as frustrating with a small square that is unlabeled is the confirm/upload button\nI was bombarded with emails updating my loan status. Yet nothing was happening. calls were not made to me that should have.

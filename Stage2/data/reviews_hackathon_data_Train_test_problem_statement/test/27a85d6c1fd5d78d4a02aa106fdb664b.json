Well they sent the wrong ones. Since this was for my work vehicle, I couldn't wait for them to correct the order so I went to Napa and had the correct parts overnight. In the meantime my neighbor need to have the brakes fixed on his 96 Passat. So I thought I would trade the wrong parts for the ones to fit his car. I found that his car used the same rotors, pads and calipers has mine. So I gave them the vin. off of his car along with the measurement of the rotors and all the vw part number that we could read. I even sent pictures of the parts. I was told they could not find the correct parts from my information.\nAt this point they agreed to refund my money upon return of the wrong parts, which we did.\nIn the meantime I sat down with all the information I had given them and found they had the correct parts for both cars the whole time. So I ordered the parts to fit the Passat and the correct parts arrived. The key was finding they had measurements listed for their cheapest rotors. After that I was able to get the correct number for their premium grade stock replacement rotors.\nI was shocked that they couldn't figure this out since it is their website.\nWhile it took A fair amount of time for me to figure this out and they did refund my money without a restocking fee I still had to spend close to $50.00 to send the wrong parts back.

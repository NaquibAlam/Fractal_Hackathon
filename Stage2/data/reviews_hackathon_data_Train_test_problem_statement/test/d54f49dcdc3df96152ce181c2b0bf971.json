I asked if she liked them and she said she wasn't impressed, as I'd picked a fabulous looking bouquet I was shocked. She sent me a photo of the flowers and they were completely different to the ones I ordered and were quite frankly not worth £5 ( 1 gerbera, some tiny pale pink roses, carnations, and lots of other battered, poor quality random unidentifiable flowers and leaves). Floraqueen refuse to give me a refund and say the flowers are of comparable quality, I know flowers may vary but to deliver a completely different arrangement bulked out with carnations and bits of greenery is unbelievable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T21:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:51:20.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I love these bags for carrying my essentials and they look great on the bike.\nI always have to replace the straps with 1/4\" zip-tie straps because the stock straps come loose causing the bag to sag and scrap the pavement on left turns. I use two [2] zip-ties per slot [total of 8] and it holds to my motorcycle like a rock. Downside, you can't remove the bag during overnights.\nShipping is a problem when the packer crams an unneeded box of saddlebag hardware [it doesn't use any] and nuts / bolts that warp the bag during shipping. The box is only large enough for just the swing arm bag and it damages [WARPS] the bag.\nIf it were not for the shoddy / stupid inclusion of the unnecessary hardware warping the swing arm bag, I would have given five [5] stars because I love the product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T21:34:40.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Got a traverse, took it home and after two day had to bring it back. Kept needing a jump to start. ( which is now on the lot to be sold yet again). I go with the intent on getting my money back. Boom.... they offer me a a 2008 gmc acadia slt. I'm like ok, I can get with this. Had the truck like a month, and it spent more time at pep boys, and meineke than it did in my own garage. Kept telling silver rock ( worst warranty company ever). Pep boys and meineke are not built for what needs to be done. It needs to go to the dealership, after a bunch of back andown forth, they find ally agreed. Had it towed to the dealership, low and behold the entire wiring honest was dry rotted, Now I'm no car expert, but I knkw.your enough that if something is dry rotted, and probably been in/under water. They finally decided to give me my money back, as well as my first note. ( I was not going to pay another. Then I just recently found out that drive time, use to be ugly duckling auto. Only advice I can give you is STAY AWAY FROM THERE!!!. I was driving in a death trap, which my 4yo son was in. I was very luck . They obviously don't care, they just care about selling thesee Lemons. I read all this about the customer service, hell with the service, give me a reliable vehicle. Keith was my reply, and he showed his true colors ( still waiting on that callback). Yes I'm calling you out by name, and hope you reading this. Don't like what I'm saying see me . Drivetime Friday you now, and Friday you forever. Went to carmax ( where I should have went in the first olace), and got a truck way better, andon't 5,000 cheaper.

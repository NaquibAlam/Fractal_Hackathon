When I tried them on, I discovered that the lenses did not fit my prescription. I tried another pair from the same boxes, and they were a little better. This tells me that the individual lenses can be of inconsistent quality and accuracy even within the same box. Additionally, rather than allow me to return the opened boxes for a full refund (which is not permitted), LensDirect could only to send new boxes. I'm still waiting on them. I'm concerned that this will not resolve the problem, because my overall concern is that these lenses vary in quality and accuracy. Based on this experience, I'd suggest ordering through your eye doctor or a more reputable source.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:30:52.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Customer service replies to me this:\n\" Aleksandra L (FloraQueen)\nFeb 18, 16:31 CET\nHi Patrick,\nOur florist confirmed he was going to deliver the flowers and we didn't receive any news about any problem, so they should have been successfully delivered.\nHowever, as we don't have a real-time update on the status, we will contact you as soon as we receive any feedback from our florist.\nKind regards,\nAleksandra\nFloraQueen Flowering the World \"\nFour days after the expected delivery this is what they send.\nIn short we are requesting a full refund via paypal.\nIn the future we will try to use another more trusted service over Floraqueen.com this company literally has gone downhill unfortunately. On another order, The florist admitted to taking Half of the chocolates they were supposed to delivery, so the recipient only had 6 pieces of chocolates which was supposed to be a \"Large box\" and Floraqueen had the audacity to say that is how its suppose to be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:46:13.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

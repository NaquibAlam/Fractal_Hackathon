Also, nobody can´t find Your e-mail address. Put it on Your sites, please.\nI booked our trip several months before the trip. During that time there\nhappened several changes with the flights. I understand the changes may have been made by airline companies, but they caused us a lot of trouble. My original choice was morning flight from Phu Quoc to Bangkok via Saigon with good transfer time. One change was that the second flight was before the first one had landed. How is that possible? What is Your role here? I assume You as a company between a customer and the flying company had noticed this is impossible. Do You only forward customers the information airline companies\nsend You like a machine?\nOne phase was that I suddenly saw in Checkmytrip, that there was something like flight two-way and not us I booked.\nAfter my first booking I got the e-tickets as it should be, but not the last tickets before I phoned an expensive phonecall to You. Then I got the tickets in my mail. The same officer said we don´t have to take out and move our luggage in Saigon. The truth was, that Vietnam Airlines don´t move them. They simply don´t do that. The officer said 1h 45 minutes is minimum transfer time in Saigon and our final schedule is ok. After the changes we had 1h40m. That is not enough in Saigon, I can tell.\nI am sorry to tell You all this. I have a lot more pleasant experiences with other companies. Travelgenio as a middleman between airline companies and a customer should serve the customer no matter what the airline company does. And e-mail adress on sites is essential.\nMs P.L\nFinland", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:19:25.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

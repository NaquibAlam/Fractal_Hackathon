I e-mailed and they acknowledged no communication and advised me of being out of stock on the refills and referred me to the parker refill options. Since I am really hung up on Visconti refills I was going to wait a little longer. I was billed on my credit card and decided to opt for the fisher space pen refills just to get this transaction completed. I asked to be notified if they are able to get the Visconti refills in the future. I did receive the fisher refills very promptly but expressed that I can get them at the local office supply store and don't need to buy them on-line.\nI do think had I not contacted them I may still be waiting (almost three weeks. I advised that their website reflect out of stock items so they don't disappoint others. I will see if they ever notify me of the arrival of Visconti refills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:43:39.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It took several calls to close the deal but he was patient and continue to provide helpful information so I could make a good decision. I had some reservations about giving my information on the phone such as ss# and bank info but he did put me at ease so that we could get this done as fast as possible. He also made sure to let me know that my first choice of companies would immediately charge my account. Since I am on a fixed income this information was important as I already have my budget for next month planned and since it is the end of the month I was not able to fund this account right away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:49:21.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

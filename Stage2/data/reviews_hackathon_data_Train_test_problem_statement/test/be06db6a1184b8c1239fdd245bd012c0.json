I called customer service on 2/15/17 and spoke to Judy. She questioned me over whether I was sure that I only received one and said that she would have to talk to the warehouse to see if the weight was such that I only received 1 instead of 2. She assured me that she would check with the warehouse and get back to me. I never received a call back. The morning of 2/16/17, I tried to call Judy again but was put to voicemail. I left her a voicemail and still never heard anything back. I called customer service back the afternoon of 2/16/17 and talked to Susan. She checked my order against an order for 1 and saw that the weight corroborated my story, and said that she would look into the issue with the warehouse and call me back the next day. The morning of 2/17/17 I had not heard from her, so I called customer service AGAIN and talked to Jamie. She said Susan was out sick and that she would look into it. Finally, she called back 2 hours later and told me that the missing meter had been shipped out way back on 2/15/17, even though I was never informed. One simple phone call or email on the first customer service rep's part would have saved me HOURS of frustration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:44:39.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

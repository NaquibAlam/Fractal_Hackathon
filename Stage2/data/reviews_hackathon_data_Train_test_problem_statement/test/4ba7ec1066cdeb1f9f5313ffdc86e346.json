Some of the candy I like, some I don't. This last box was extremely disappointing. I take the time to rate the candies I receive. If I give a candy one star, I really don't expect to see it again. Low and behold, this month I received one of the candies I rated one star AGAIN. Not only that, but I have received the same licorice pinwheels for 3 of the six months that I have been getting shipments, which leads me to believe that they don't have much variety. Really? The same candy 3 times in 6 months??", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:56:23.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

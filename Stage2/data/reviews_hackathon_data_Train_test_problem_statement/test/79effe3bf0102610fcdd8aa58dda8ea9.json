Then my friend found the faulty of the battery, so i cantacted MA,one of the customer servicr staff -Savannah was friendly and helpful on arrange a return to MA\nBut then Savannah was missing, and no reply from her anymore since her last email on 19th Jan 2017. In between i had send 5 meesage to her but no reply at all.\n10 days after i sent out my parcel on 2 feb 2017, i'm still received nothing from MA. I was starting worry on it , so I contacted Live chat provided by MA, they told me they have received my item a week ago. They were in the process of testing. I was so kind and understanding to them, and what i can do was only waiting.\nWhat's coming the next is more interesting. On 8th Feb, i still have nothing with me, so i was contact with MA again, i lost my patient on it anymore. I told them, i have been send it out since 3 weeks ago, they never informing me and updating my anything about my UE Boom, so i need to know what going on ! I was told that they have to spend 24-48 hours to reply customer email, but the problem was i have been waiting for more than that! And they were going to check with technical department.\nAfter that,i received an email from technical department said that they will send out the on the same day. I have no idea what going on if i didnt contact MA. I assumed that they forgot about me.\nFew days later, i received my replacement. But there was another problem, the original UE Boom 2 i returned was with well presentation hard plastic case. But replacement UE BOOM 2 was come with all paper cardboard material case and packaging. As it was a Birthday present, the replecement's appreance was really low class when compare to the first one. And I have never been told about this before that.\n* picture provide if requested\nI'm feeling like been fooling around again.Therefore, i contacted Ma about that again, then they replied and asked for picture proof.\nIn between, i found another problem with the bluetooth of the speaker, it tooks more than 10 minutes to get connect to any device, no matter iphone, samsung or ho laptop. I have to keep reopen my device and speaker bluetooth to get it connected. So i reported to them as well.\nAt the first, they were telling me that the paper casing is newer packaging, and not their problem and they cant do anything on it. Then i replied it's fine , if i has been told, but it's not.\nFrom the offline email they were replying, I can feel that they were trying to ignore me and starting unfriendly to me. So they were telling me if i believe the item is faulty, so need to return it back.\nI was fine to returnted it back, but the problem was i have no idea how long again it have to wait for !\nI have lost patient to them anymore. They let me feel like im annoying them. No one would spend more than Nearly a month to a same thing .\nSo i decided to go for Live chat for my question and i would like request Refund instead of infinity waiting if they couldnt offer me the same case.\nThen the 'friendly' customer service representative Ruth was telling me that they cant do the refund, and her colleague was sent me the email cleary about returned them an item to check, she will send me again if I dont understand on it.\nI was more angry about her attitute and the way she act like, i would like to know the exactly date taken based on long wait last time. Then she keep replied with copy common sentences like\n'have you sent the 2nd unit back to us? doesn't look like we have received yet'\n'have you sent the 2nd unit back to us? doesn't look like we have received yet .. We are unable to refund uintil we or our supplier have confirmed product is faulty I'm afraid'\nSo i was really angry about that, so i was telling her not just telling the thing i know and think from your side, please do think from customer view as well.\nI need to know how long it takes for this !\nAfter lots of repeated sentences, she END UP our conversation and quit the chat without informing me.\nIm was shock! How come a customer could do like this to customer ! It's horrible and terrieble customer service i Ever had ! The most irrespect from the customer service representative.\nMighty Ape has big word from their website saying biggest No 1 online store in NZ, friendly customer service provided, accept and feedback.\nBut i have received nothing from MA about the feedback i placed from 31th Jan 2017.\nAnd thay cant even provide me any contact number i could call.\nOne and half months pass since i bought this item from Mightly Ape.\nIm still waiting for anyone from Might Ape to telling me what's going on with all my experienced.\nBut i can say it is the worst online shopping experience i ever had.\n* i have read few review from other website that Might Ape had problem with product and service provide to customer .\nIt was my first and my last time on it !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:46:44.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

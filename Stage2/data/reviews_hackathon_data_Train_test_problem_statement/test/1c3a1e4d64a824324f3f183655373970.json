We arrived at the hotel to be checked in, and shown a map of the local area by the receptionist. We were then told Agoda had by \"technical fault\" utterly messed up our booking of a luxury suite by double booking it, and that we had a standard room \"for tonight but no other solution moving forward\". The hotel said it had tried calling Agoda to obtain our contact details for a week, and hadn't been able to receive any response whatsoever. Having gotten a representative on the phone from Agoda, I had to manage Agoda speaking with the hotel to understand what on earth had gone wrong, and why we had been allowed to arrive in Cape Town at the hotel, and find that we had a room for one night only, having paid in excess of Â£850 for a 6 night stay and a luxury suite.\nWe decided to accepted Agoda's apparent alternative equivalent hotel, checking into the Protea Ice and Fire, where we were placed in a room so small we were unable to properly open our suitcases. Please keep in mind while you read this, this was our honeymoon. We ended up in a bar at 10pm at night desperately trying to find accommodation for the rest of our stay.\nWhen we checked out of Protea we were told we owed both car parking and tourist levies (if we wanted breakfast, we had to pay for that too) - which we paid for out of our own pocket above the fee already paid to Agoda. The Hippo Boutique Hotel we originally checked into had both parking and breakfast included. This was no equivalent.\nWhen we complained we were told we could receive a full refund; we had booked a different hotel on a credit card, and so requested the refund to be made to this card to cover the outgoing costs of the hotel we had just booked. The representative on the phone said this was no problem at all, and took the full details down. They screwed this up to, sending the refund back to a different card and utterly messing up our finances.\nAll the while, we were in South Africa, on British mobile phones, calling Hong Kong to get this issue sorted. We have yet to receive our phone bills from this, but Agoda will be receiving our invoice for those costs, as well as the parking and tourist levy.\nWhilst the representatives we have spoken to have been patient, they fundamentally didn't understand what we had booked into and how their alternative wasn't acceptable. They have then cost us further expense, as well as causing us to be in a financial situation that is outside of our control and will take us several months to recover from. At this stage I havn't mentioned the emotional distress of arriving in a foreign country, a new city on your honeymoon and being told the hotel you had booked into, were so excited to arrive wasn't available (the staff member on the desk at Hippo Boutique Hotel went so far as to say that the couple of were staying in the suite we had booked, had paid double what we had - we were effectively penalised by having secured a good deal through Agoda). We are still none the wiser as to how this happened, nor have we receive a formal apology or compensation from Agoda. We are considering our legal position and will be taking action to retrieve costs and damages.\nDo not use Agoda, it is a shambles of a company that doesn't care about the holiday you have worked hard to earn and enjoy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:36:48.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

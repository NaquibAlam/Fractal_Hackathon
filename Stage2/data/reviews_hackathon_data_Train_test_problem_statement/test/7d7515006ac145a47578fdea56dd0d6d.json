I ordered an item and not received it. When I finally contacted the seller had no response at all. Then finally after several attempts DHgate intervened. They where no help at all all they kept repeating, to track item. My response was yes I have tracked the item and as far as the mail service is concerned it was delivered. But I have not received the item what can we do?\nThe seller offered a refund of $0.01, This I found very insulting. So I opened a dispute. This went on for a few weeks and was very very frustrating. All DHgate would say was to track item, with no intervention with seller at all.\nToday I received an email from DHgate that it has been resolved. Ha Ha Ha. I have not received a refund or the item in question,so how on earth has this been resolved. If you order from DHgate, my advice is order at your own risk and pray you receive your item, if not kiss your money good by.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:45:58.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Generally I have always been happy with the trees I received. A recent order I placed arrived quickly and in good order. The main reason I give them four stars instead of five is because of an order I received last year in which several pecans and pawpaws never leafed out. After placing this order I'd come across some outspoken bad reviews of the company, and started to get nervous that I was going to get the run around about replacing these trees. However, I wrote them and they were very prompt and courteous. I received new healthy trees that are potted up and looking good now. I think, as happens in any organization, that this company may have gone through a rocky time recently, but has \"tightened ship\", and worked out its nursery quality and customer service problems. I recommend them to clients when I consult on edible landscaping, and will continue to order from them in the future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:26:49.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I'd heard the bad reviews (ex. \"Oh you have to reject every month or they'll charge you!\") but I found something I liked, and I figured they were at least being up front about their business practice, so I gave it a shot. I got my first outfit, and then kept up with skipping each month as I got the email at the first of each month. I liked the leggings I got, skipping each month was easy, I didn't understand why people complained so much.\nThen something happened. About a week or so into the month I saw that I had a $50 charge on my credit card from Fabletics (which just happened to overdraw my account, so thanks for that). How could that be? I had been doing so well at skipping each month, and I remembered doing it that month. But I didn't want to be one of those whiners. I knew what I signed up for, and must have a had a bad internet connection, or maybe I clicked the link in my email but forgot to click the skip button on the website. I made up a bunch of scenarios to justify it as my mistake.\nNext month I realized what happened. Without any warning, Fabletics added an extra splash page after you click the \"Skip this month\" button. Yet another page comes up asking \"do you REALLY want to skip this month?\" .... YES. I couldn't believe it. I was tricked. I thought about how much of an increase Fabletics must have seen in their sales that month just by adding that page. Them - laughing at their ingenious marketing skills while I'm crying because my account was overdrawn again.\nWhatever, I thought. I did like those leggings I got originally, so now I just have an excuse to buy some more. I decided to wait for a good sale to come around so I could get the most for my money. \"Buy one outfit get one free!\" my email said. Perfect. I'll get two outfits with my $50 credit, then close my account and be done with this whole mess.\nSo there I am, two outfits in my cart totaling $50, when I see a little blurb \"You have a credit you could use, you are currently using a BOGO promotion.\" Oh ok, so that's how I use my credit. I click it. My cart is still totaling $50. Now the blurb says \"There is a BOGO promotion you could use. You are currently using a credit.\" Here is where I lose my sh *t.\nAre you effing kidding me?! I can't use both?! I have paid this company $50 (just because they tricked me) and now they're telling me I can only use that money on certain things?! Two outfits, BOGO, is $50. I have paid them $50. But no. Not on that.\nSo fine. I put two pairs of capris from your sale section in my cart, no promotion needed, used my credit, and now I am DONE. Aside from the fact that your entire business model is built on trusting people to be idiots, your site is incredibly hard to use. I specialize in UI and UX and jesus I couldn't get from one section to another, I constantly had rollovers blocking the whole page anytime my mouse went over the top half of the page, it was impossible to tell which items were on sale and which ones weren't (although I assume that bit is on purpose), and just all around I had a terrible experience. Even checking out, I got several error pages (by no fault of my own) before I could place my order. And despite my password being saved on chrome, one day it just didn't work anymore. And when I clicked \"forgot password\" I never got an email sent to me. Not even in my spam folder. I had to talk to customer service to reset my password. It was ludicrous.\nAnyway, you're terrible and despite the fact that your clothes are in fact decent quality I will never shop here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:50:50.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

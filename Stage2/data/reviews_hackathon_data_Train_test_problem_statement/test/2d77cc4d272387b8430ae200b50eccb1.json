The meals are easy to make and taste great. My husband has even started cooking; it's that easy to follow the recipes, and everything you need is given! I love not having to go food shopping every week and wasting food (and sometimes even coming home to an already cooked meal) haha! I've recommended HelloFresh to almost everyone in my family and they're hooked now too. It's awesome your able to give away the free meals to those who want to try! Awesome company!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:21:28.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

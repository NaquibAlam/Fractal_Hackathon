It's been almost 2 months since I purchased 2 websites! Can't get anyone to call me back to let me know the status of the project and the one time I did get a date (via email) on when it would been finished, it wasn't. So now I have no idea what's going on! Horrible experience so far Worst!!\nI wish the people who I've already paid to set-up our websites was as responsive as their sales guy was!\nTheir \"project manager\" Tiffany Lloyd is horrible and doesn't answer simple questions and is not competent to meet the simple deadlines she sets or give regular feedback.\nThomas Norton - I think he is some guy who is working on my website (who knows). He has poor communication skills and won't give status reports either.\nTried using their chat support today and they didn't know what was going on either. The person I was chatting with said they would submit a \"ticket\" for me, which I've already done many times with no results. That's why I was trying to use their chat support.\nThis company is the worst!!\nBrian", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:56:25.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

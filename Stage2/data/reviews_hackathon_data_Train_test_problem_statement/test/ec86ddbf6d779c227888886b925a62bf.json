DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!!\nTHIS IS A HUGE SCAM\nWe canceled our order the day we made them. It turns out you can get your password without rushing it in 7 days. We went through the US Postal Service. It cost us $174.\nWhat REALLY stinks is the Rushmypassport.com site has yet to refund us.. They processed the charge in less than an hour. However it's now one month later and still no refund. We've contacted the State Department. Will be contacting the Better Business Bureau as well. And we'll be going on to every site we can find to give them poor ratings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T17:26:46.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I couldn't figure out the site and ultimately picked up the phone. This was just as irritating.\nI've been framing for over 25 yrs. I cut my own mats. I understand how to measure a piece of artwork for get the frame measurement.\nLong story short, one frame came a random 12 x 24\" instead of a \"standard\" size 20\" x 24\" frame ( which I pointed out to the agent as being a standard size. Nothing complicated).\nIt was explained to me that the order was read back at the end of the call making it ultimately my error....not theirs.\nI use this company because it's economical and efficient. I can't afford re-stock fees and return shipping charges. I don't have time to mess around trying to navigate their website. I feel that I can't afford to not find a different framing company to buy my frames from.\nDisappointed,\nDustin Smith", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:39:33.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

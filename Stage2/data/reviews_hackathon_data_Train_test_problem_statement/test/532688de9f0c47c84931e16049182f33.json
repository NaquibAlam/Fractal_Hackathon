I can tell that Shannon was only about the sell because she acted as if coming to th train station was too much for her to do. She lied and said well I got another person coming and I was there for awhile and no one ever showed up. She also told me that she would wash my car and fill it up. My car definitely was NOT washed and it was extremely dirty in the inside. She only fil the tank up half way so she lied about that to. The customer service part can definitely be improved!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T15:21:27.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

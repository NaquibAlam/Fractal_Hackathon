Then if you don't want an outfit and click that you don't want anything, you get charged anyway which is completely dumb. Sorry Kate. I'm telling everyone I know that this is a rip off. I've had many subscription plans before but you don't get charged even if you don't want the item for the month. This is basically stealing if you ask me.\nYou need a better plan that wants to keep customers rather than rip them off and they discontinue the service.\nNot cool.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T13:25:48.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

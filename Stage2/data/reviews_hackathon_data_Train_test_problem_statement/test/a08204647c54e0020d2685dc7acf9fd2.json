Will never order from dior.com again. They mistakenly sent me another customers order instead of my actual order. I called to report the issue and they sent me a return label. When I called to follow up, I was told that they were waiting for my product to be returned by the person who received it by mistake. They explained that they had to credit the payment to the wrong parties first before being able to ship the correct package. It had now been 3 weeks since I placed my order and 2 weeks after my estimated arrival date. I had to spend 45 minutes on the phone with multiple customer service agents before I was told that they would ship me my actual product, and I had to request that they expedite the shipping so that I wouldn't have to wait any longer. No apology ever, no attempt to make up for what was their mistake. All agents were either clueless or rude. While understandable that mistakes can happen, it is unacceptable to not make any attempt to correct the mistakes made or apologize to the customer. Will never use this website again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:10:49.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

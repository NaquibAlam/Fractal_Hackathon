The ordeal started with placing the order online. After trying several times, the order did not go through and I was prompted to call the customer service. The customer service rep could not resolve the problem even after trying 3 different credit cards I use regularly. His response was there is a \"conflict\" in my address! I eventually managed to place the order online myself. The order arrived a day late. Once opened by my sister, we realized that the set is missing and they have only sent us the complementary samples, while they had charged my credit card. i called the customer service and the rep first asked if i still had the original packaging. Then he said they had to place an inquiry to UPS that takes 5-10 business days followed by an internal inquiry. I told him that there was no point in contacting UPS as I had received the package but it was missing the actual order. He did not understand how idiotic his proposed course of action was and at the end said there was no other way around it. I demanded either a replacement sent right away or my money back and he refused. I demanded to speak to his supervisor. He put me on hold forever. I called again later that day and spoke to the same person. This time he said that they would not charge my credit card but offered no explanation or apology for this mess. The charge kept showing as pending for several days on my credit card account. Bottom line, terrible experience, terrible website, terrible customer service. Do not waste your time with these people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:37:44.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

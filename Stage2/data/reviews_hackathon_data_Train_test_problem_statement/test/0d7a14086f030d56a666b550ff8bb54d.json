Three days ago I booked 3 tickets for a London show with last minute. All booked but the operator I booked it with on the phone said his system was down and couldn't give me a reference no. But it was booked. He would email.it over.\nThe next day the email hadn't arrived.\nI phoned and waited for ever for an answer.\nThe next day my girls and I excited bought our train tickets ando looked forward to the show.\nOn the train and still with no email I phoned them again. 15 minutes it took for the girl on the phone to tell me she has found my booking and would be emailing me conformation.\nGuess what the email never arrived.\nSo at the theatre after spending nearly Â£100 to get there and the box office tell me there are no tickets reserved for me.\nI phone lastminute again and after 10 minutes get through to someone who was hopeless. I demand to speak to a manager. At this point my children are getting upset. We now have 5 minutes until the show starts. The manager comes to the phone who just tells me that he will investigate and he will come back to me in 72 hours !!! I asked him 5 times to confirm if all thier calls are recorded. He did not want to answer, and this from a manager.\nI have demanded a transcript of the 3 calls I made. Will I get them, based on the above I doubt it. I will however be taking this to solicitors.\nFinally after the upset the theatre manager who witnessed the unfolding event looked and fortunately had 3 tickets available at a cost of nearly 3 times the price I had originally booked.\nI don't have bundles of money but couldn't bear to see the upset on my girls faces.\nI am absolutely discussed with this appalling customer service. The manager I spoke to should be sacked and the girl who confirmed she had found my booking also needs some sort of training.\nWhat was set and planned to be a special treat for myself and my girls turned out to be a very expensive and stressful time.\nDisgusting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:20:09.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

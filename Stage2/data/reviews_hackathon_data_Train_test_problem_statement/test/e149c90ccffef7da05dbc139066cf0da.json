The tickets prices were high because this was the game where David Ortiz was to have his number retired in a ceremony at the game.\nWhen I purchased the tickets, the seat selection was not disclosed. When I got the tickets, I found out through several \"virtual view\" sites that the seats were obstructed by a pole.\nWhen I communicated this to TicketCity, they told me at first that they people for whom they were selling the tickets would have to agree to exchange them, then later they told me that this was an issue with the Red Sox and because they did not write \"obstructed view\" on the ticket, I could not exchange tickets. Then the company told me they would resell my seats and take a 10% commission.\nThis was the worst experience I have ever had with a broker. I have dealt with many national and local brokers and in no previous case have I had any issues when something wasn't exactly right. They simply do not want to take money out of their pocket and were unwilling to take back the tickets and exchange them....keep in mind this event is over 3 months away.\nI hope my credit card company can get involved here....over $1000 to sit with a pole blocking my view????. Had the seats been disclosed, I could have done my homework to find this issue, but their policy is not to disclose seat location, only the row and section.\nI would not recommend this company to anyone", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:35:43.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

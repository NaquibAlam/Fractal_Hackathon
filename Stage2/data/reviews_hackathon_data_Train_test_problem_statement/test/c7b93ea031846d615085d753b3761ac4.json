However on ordering it said 'restricted' which I presumed meant restricted due to not able to resale tickets again. On receiving tickets and printing out they said restricted viewing-I was then very worried that there was a major pole or similar in the view. The tickets cost around $220 each, but on the ticket it said they were $60 each my Mother in law asked if we got them cheap The restricted tickets turned out to be my husbands seat-he couldn't see the last person on the stage at the side-which he was not worried about-my MIL had a perfect view. So it turned out well, but when giving for a gift it was a bit stressful. Should have better explanation on website with restricted wording.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T18:44:51.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have a few websites which has their private branding hotel search script. Recently i noticed that the script is no longer working. I have sent several emails and filled the form on the website & still did not get any reply. My account has reached $85. Reading the online reviews It seems that when you are close to $100 so you can withdraw your commissions, they tend to close/suspend accounts or simply just ignore their hard working affiliates.

I got a Toyota Corolla last month from the pinellas park location. I was on a tight budget and I didn't wanna keep bothering the sales guy Trevor to test drive anymore cars as I felt he was getting irritated with me and I neeesed to get a car that day. The car was ok when I first got it a week later I started feeeling the steering wheals brakes the car being shaky if I drive it over 60 and the sound it makes when I hit the gas. Keep in mind my payment is 209 or around that every 2 weeks. That's my very own first car ever with my name financing. I also have a child so safety is very important to me. I couldn't stress more about this part when I was there so they can be honest with me and show me to a good car. It's only been a month I can't afford to take it to the shop with this payment I make on it plus 160 insurance. I'm so disappointed because I thought at first I had a great experience there but i guess you can never have a good experience in a buy here pay here kinda dealer because they know you're a desperate for a car with a low a credit score.

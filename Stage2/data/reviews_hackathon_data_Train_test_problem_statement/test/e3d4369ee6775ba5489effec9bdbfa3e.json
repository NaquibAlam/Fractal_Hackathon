First of all, you can't call it a booking it's more like a request for a booking. They'll 'send' you a confirmation within 24 to 48hours. In this day and age of the internet, you shouldn't have to wait more than 1 minute to receive a booking confirmation. So we waited more than 48hours and started to get nervous if we would received confirmation or not. We made calls to their helpline based in India of course with people called Michael or David (I doubt it's ever their real names!). You could tell they're Indian with their accent yet they give you false names. How can a company ever pretend to be honest when their workers are given false names to talk with customers... Anyway, waited for confirmation never received so we called and asked them to cancel the booking which we haven't received confirmation of the cancellation either! What a disgrace of a company. Bravofly have acquired lastminute.com and they're both poorly managed companies! Do yourself a favor and book your flights directly with the airlines and use Booking.com for hotels. At least, you will get instant confirmation!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:55:05.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

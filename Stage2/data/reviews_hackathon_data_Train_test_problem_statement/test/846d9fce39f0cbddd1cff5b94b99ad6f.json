This is unacceptable. Also, when we were booking we thought we may need to cancel due to potential date changes, and we read that \"Cancellations and changes of your booking are free of charge up to 48 hours prior to arrival\" which led us to believe cancellation was possible. We tried to cancel after finding how much we'd overpaid, but were told then that our deposit was non-refundable.

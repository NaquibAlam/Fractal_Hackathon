I tried calling the business multiple times to schedule an appointment. They NEVER returned my calls and I always got voicemail. I paid $98 for this. And nothing. I contacted Groupon about the issue and they would only give me \"groupon bucks\" and not a refund. Very unhelpful customer service.\nAlso as a merchant I tried to start a campaign and it said that it was active. However when I accessed my campaigns it does not show up. I went on chat and they said they couldn't help me and gave me an email.\nSo overall - not a very good experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:41:16.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A manager said he couldn't send it because some of the order was no longer available because no one caught the issue at hand. So he canceled the order & I had to find new items but the items I wanted were really the best ones that I lost because no one addressed the issue when it 1st happened. Then I had to call a manager back again, my account never got credited. Being flustered & frustrated ...my mistake, I put the wrong shipping address when I placed the 2nd order. I called a manager again immediately & he reassured me it would be shipped to the correct address...NOPE!!! I was going to call back again & complain but I just didn't want to have to deal with it so I paid to ship the order to my mom myself. The reason that I gave it a 2 star is because even though I had a very rough experience the product is a good buy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:18:42.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

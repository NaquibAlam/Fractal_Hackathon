The choices on the website was not clear. Please change that and make it very clear. I hope I won't have a problem sending this wig back, if so I'll never order from here again.\nAlso you need to make more gray wigs like this and more kinky ones too. We older ladies like the styles you make for the younger generation. Now they are wearing the gray color too. Make more!\nThanks\nPS, I really like your wigs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T23:33:51.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

However, when it arrived, my daughter was so excited to try it on and was devastated that it didn't fit and was too big. I called the next morning and this super nice lady emailed me a return label and by that morning, the dress was on its way back. As soon as she saw that the label she had emailed was scanned and on its way, she shipped out the smaller size. Absolutely no hassle what so ever. The dress is absolutely gorgeous and of the highest quality. Couldn't be more satisfied. Was a little hesitant ordering online, but they were very helpful and I can guarantee there won't be another dress like it at my daughters prom. Very satisfied!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:35:43.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

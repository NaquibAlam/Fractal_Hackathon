The bead on both tyres was not finished properly which was the reason why the tyres would not seat. Both the bike shop and i tried to contact the UK customer service but were always placed in a queing system. I gave up and threw the tyres and have now fitted alternatives (which inflated as per the instructions) The product may be cheaper, but if it is not fit for purpose then it is money down the drain regrettably. I cannot recommend Mantel as i was unable to speak to customer service, if there is such a service for the UK. I don't know if there is, as neither i nor the bike shop could get hold of anyone!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:41:37.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

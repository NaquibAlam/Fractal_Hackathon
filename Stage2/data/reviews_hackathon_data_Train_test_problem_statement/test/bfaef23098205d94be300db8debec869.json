Det gør bare jeg ikke kan stole på dem mere, jeg er den som er smuttet.\nLet me do this in English, so everyone can see:\nI have been a customer since 2009 if I remember correct. When I bought it back then, the price was 9,- DKK. Today (14/02-17) I receive an e-mail with a topic that says something like \"67% more disk space for your website, e-mail and much more!\"... When I read the e-mail I'm chocked to see that it's actually a warning that the price is going up, and now cost me 19,- pr. month. Apparently the \"much more!\" is more than 100% price tag I think. This is totally unacceptable!\nWhen I log into the service I see that I have payed more than 9,- pr. month since 2014?! Well do I feel silly. So I go back in my e-mail archive to find the e-mail where they warn me about this price change, and what do I find. The same (*!#&?) approach, the e-mail says I get more disk space and features in the subject field and when I read it I find the warning... How can you trust a company like this?! Here I am, a trusting idiot... well lesson learned, I'm out.\nPlease share this with everyone you know, maybe they too have overseen this warning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:37:30.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

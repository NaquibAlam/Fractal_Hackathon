This company had such a great name and product I was so excited to build a custom fire pit for myself. From that day on, (the day that I paid almost 4k for a fire pit) it went downhill. How disappointing.\nThe errors were endless. First they said it would be delivered in 2 weeks from ordering, it was even printed on my invoice. After 4 weeks, I called to find out where it was and it took 3 attempts to even get someone to answer me. Once I got an answer they said it would be shipped the next week. After another 2 weeks, I called again and got the same, no response. Finally, they told me it was shipping that week. When I finally got it, over 6 weeks late, it was missing a part that is needed to actually make it work. I had to go to Home Depot and buy a 60$ worth of parts (gage) that we needed to install for it to work.\nThen we realized that the propane tank would not fit in the base. We tried for a while in different directions and no luck. We called the company and they had the nerve to send me a video showing me a lady sticking a propane tank into the base. Really? So I sent them a video back showing how mine DID NOT FIT! They argued with me for a while and send me to the manufacturer to discuss it with them. It went back and forth for a while until they told me that there were \"different sized tanks\" and some manufacturers made them slightly smaller. I knew they were wrong but I agreed to drive around town and see if we could find one that was smaller. Total waste of my time, all standard tanks are the SAME SIZE. Finally, after more arguing, they agreed to send me a new base that I would have to disassemble and reassemble on my own. Can I remind you that this fire pit was almost 4k??\nThe base arrived a week later and I hired a handy man to help install it as it was not a simple project. After we determined that the tank in fact fit in this base, he started the process. I thought things were going well and low and behold, another issue. He calls me outside and said \"there is no hole for the igniter panel\". I almost burst in tears. Sure enough, the old base had a big hole cut in the base for the igniter panel to be mounted and this new one did not. I called Starfire immediately. They had the manufacturer call me and can you believe what she said to meâ€¦ \"I understand you need some assistance in walking you through how to swap out your base\". I almost lost it on her. I calmly told her what was going on and she insisted that we had the hole we needed. I had to take pictures again and finally she said \"oh yeah we shipped you a different base, you needed the one with the \" So I told her that my handyman was going to try and cut a hole in it and try and make it work. She offered nothing. I called Starfire and demanded not only someone pay for my gage, but someone pay for the hand man's time and materials. On top of it I decided I wanted more. I wanted compensation for the weeks of aggravation that this has caused.\nIt has now been 3 weeks since this has all happened and NO ONE has called me back nor has offered a solution. When you spend this kind of money on something you expect a certain level of customer service. While the man at Starfire tried to help and tried to resolve some of the issues, in the end he failed because I still have no resolve. I will NEVER buy from them again and you can be sure that my voice will be heard. I am an educated and reasonable woman who was willing to work with them to fix the issues and they treated me like a moron and gave no compensation for THEIR mistakes. This is unacceptable and the ONLY reason that they even got One Star is that the unit is beautiful. Don't buy from them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:43:57.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

FloraQueen doesn't work with any Danish florist, so the flowers are shipped with postal service from Germany! The quality of the flowers are terrible, the bouquets are ugly and the delivery service through the Danish Post (Post Nord) is useless. It takes 5-6 days and the receiver (me, it was a birthday gift ordered from New Zealand) must pick up the gift at the post office themselves.\nI have just read the reply from FloraQueen and it simply isn't true what you say. I was in fact home on the day of the delivery, but by using the Danish Postal service, that only has certain delivery days - and not a courrier - the bouquet was not even delivered on the required day! If you work with Danish florist, it seems very odd that the flowers were sent from Germany. On top I didn't even write in my review that this delivery was a second delivery, as an apology from you after a complaint, since the first order was supposed to arrive on my birthday in January. This wasn't delivered but had to be picked up at the post office as well as it was the wrong bouquet and not the one ordered by my partner! Not good enough FloraQueen! You should refund the money as an apology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:50:33.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I called this week I was told it could take 6-8 weeks for my furniture to arrive and they were waiting on my sofa, which I was unaware that they didn't have that piece nor was I told it would take so long. I had to take my receipt to show that the timeframe they were stating was never on my receipt and I was never told verbally either. Once I went in store to prove I was telling the truth, I didn't receive an apology or any empathy towards their mistake. I'm so dissatisfied with the service. Nearly two weeks later, and basically being called a liar, I still haven't received my furniture. I'll never purchase from them again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:11:07.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

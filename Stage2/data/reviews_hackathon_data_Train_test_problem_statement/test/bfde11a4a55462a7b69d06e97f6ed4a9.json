I didn't get clear answers and just took the information and emails to each vendor and went back through it again with each. I will not use this service and information in the future. Best part of it was the legwork and time consuming process of finding something was taken over by her. Didn't even use any one of the vendors, but thanks anyway!\nI worked in call centers and she was more than interested in the required scripts and not listening to me. Should I have been the subject in question, I would've had the call pulled from management, been counseled up to being terminated.

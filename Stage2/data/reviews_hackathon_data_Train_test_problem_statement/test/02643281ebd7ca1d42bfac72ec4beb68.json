This is completely ridiculous, what kind of company is this?\nMy flight is in 3 days and I still dont have a confirmation after calling them many times already and sending several e-mails.\nHow hard is it for a travel agency to contact an airline company and confirm a flight? How incompetent can their customer service be?\nJust the first leg of my flight has been cancelled. At least I need a confirmation that the others legs are still fine so I can book for my owe the first leg\nThis is unacceptable", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T20:32:54.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

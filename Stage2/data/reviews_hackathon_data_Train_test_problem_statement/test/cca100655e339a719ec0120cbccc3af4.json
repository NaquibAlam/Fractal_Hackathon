First we could not get the shower working, engineer came on time next day. Found out the fault is with the shower itself and we are not covered for it.... Fair enough. Then on the same day our boiler was serviced by Kirk. That's where all started to be disastrous. After the boiler was serviced it was making a lot of noise the next day there was no hot water at all. We have young children it was so hard to jungle things around. Despite I suspect my boiler was working all fine till Kirk the engineer did something with it. Already frustrated since we had guest coming over we ask them if they can send someone to fix it suppose to be 24hrs service. FOR them this was not an emergency we were ask that they can get someone only the next day(not to mention the guy on the phone was trying to sell and upgrade to us seriously don't you think after failing to look after your customer we would want an upgrade with you I would rather tell my acquaintance to avoid you) . No option took a day off just to be told at the last minute that they have other emergencies they can't come but they will make sure someone comes tomorrow so another wasted for us. Gradually the heater has stopped working as well. JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:09:21.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

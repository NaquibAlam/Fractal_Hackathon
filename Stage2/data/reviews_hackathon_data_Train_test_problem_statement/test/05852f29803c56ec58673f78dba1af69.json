This latest order was time sensitive so I requested (and paid handsomely) for two-day delivery. I received confirmation that the order had shipped Thursday, 2 February. The pen was a birthday gift and the recipient was leaving home to travel to Europe on Monday. I believe that the two-day delivery for which I paid should have gotten it to him on Saturday. I corresponded with him after his arrival in Europe and the pen did not arrive on Saturday. I am very disappointed. I will, of course, continue to do business with Colorado Pen as this is just one lapse among a number of good experiences, but you disappointed me on this one. M Young\nIt is unfortunate that the information provided in your response, regarding Saturday delivery, is not is not readily available on the website/order page. That in is obviously not \"common knowledge\". Had I been aware I wouldn't have paid extra for a speedy delivery.

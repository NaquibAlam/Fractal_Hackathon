When most flag companies ceased making/selling the Confederate flag due to \"political\" pressure, it made me angry. I am a southern gal and proud of it. I had never flown the Confederate flag, but feel I have the right to do so--it is part of American history and many lost their lives for their cause. I decided I would fly one--but was shocked that there were none available and companies would no longer make them. Thank you, American Flags, for not buckling under pressure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:04:17.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They had us jumping though hoops to get qualified. We had plenty of funds in the account to prove we received funding regularly, provided copies of checks, bank verification letter. We also provided a tax return showing adequate funding. The business owner is very conscience of who she provides her financial information to due to severe fraud in the past, she takes serious precautions when it comes to her business. Firsr, Ondeck tried to say the business should have their own tax return. We explained that since the owner is a sole proprietor and the business was an LLC, she filed a schedule C. The underwriter didn't know that. We provided a preview only voided check, that we provide anyone who needs a voided check ( no issues ever before)\" they wanted verification from the bank. They wanted the articles of incorporation, we provided that.They did notice that the social on one of the tax returns was off a digit( The IRS didn't even notice that). So, as a result, they didn't feel comfortable giving the loan. What a waste of time and effort.

Picked up and charge cord would no longer fit into port, home button is recessed and scratches all around edges, and won't charge. This phone was always kept in case and was in excellent condition. Then and they told me they were going to refund total, BUT would take several days, WHY?? charged my account before repair was even attempted why should I wait 5 days to get my money back, phone not fixed and even damaged. This was my 2nd experience with fox paw, 1st excellent, 2nd time terrible, I question if I would try them again.

I made an order and paid expedited shipping thinking I would get two supplements that they said were IN STOCK. The day I think I'm going to get them, I still had not received a shipping notice. I contact them and they send me a message back the next day saying they were OUT OF STOCK of both items and would not get the items for 5-7 daysâ€”and that it could be longer. (I needed these supplements sooner and could have purchased them on Amazon and received them by now. Why did I go with eVitamins to save $10?! *facepalm*) When I called them, no one was available; I had to leave a message. I cancelled the order via email; they do get back to you during business hours. BTW, I went back to check the supplements to see if they were indeed out of stock and their website said they were STILL IN STOCK! I am disappointed and will not be buying from eVitamins again! If you need your supplements and want their reduced prices, I would not count that their products are in stock when they say they are.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T23:33:31.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

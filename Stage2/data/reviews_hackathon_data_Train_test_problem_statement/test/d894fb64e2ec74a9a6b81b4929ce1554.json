Confirmed availability with Windjammer before purchasing the Groupon, then purchased, only to find out I haven't actually bought anything until Groupon finishes \"processing\" and sends me an email. After waiting a while for the email, called customer support to find out the credit card \"may have denied\" the transaction despite no indication as such on the Groupon site. Yet another call to the credit card company (BofA) revealed no denial, just an authorization of zero dollars. Finally another call to Groupon revealed because I am a new customer, I have to wait an extra 48 hours for them to process. Fortunately, Windjammer (another much easier call) went beyond the call of duty and is holding a cabin until the Groupon \"processing\" is done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:48:01.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

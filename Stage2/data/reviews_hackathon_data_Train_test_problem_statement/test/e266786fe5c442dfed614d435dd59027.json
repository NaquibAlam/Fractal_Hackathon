They also talked about end of annual plan yesterday night, so we asked to be more specific, why a end? They said that every night all annual plan not subscribe are canceled and begin the next day with another quotation asked and today we tried to contact them, they replied that the annual plan doesn't exist anymore??? We asked them help to fix this problem because it wasn't explain like this, they don't reply anymore and they evicted me of the chat, we let some messages on their website but no call back and it's impossible to have another quotation online for an annual plan today neither for a simple cover for one rent with a campervan and 4x4, we felt abandon unless we just want to subscribe an insurance because the pick up of the campervan was yesterday... so disappointed...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T21:30:53.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

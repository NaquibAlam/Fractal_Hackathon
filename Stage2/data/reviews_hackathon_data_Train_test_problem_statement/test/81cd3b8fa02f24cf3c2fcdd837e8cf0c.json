Basic, easy things that should have all been the starting point of a coin design, but weren't.\nAfter the 5th edit and the second week, I just took their mock-up into photoshop and designed the coin myself.\nThen I asked them to put a brushed metal effect on the background. I uploaded one of their own coins with this effect, as an example.\nSo then I get an edit back just showing that example coin. . .\nI have to write to my design coordinator and he says \"They're still using your design, just adding that brass finish you want!\"\nI tell him I don't want a brass finish...I want brushed metal.\nThe edit came back with my logo (which is fine), and the brushed metal effect (which is great)\nBut now the coin is listed as brushed brass (not silver), with a brushed brass background effect, and the finishes are listed as brushed brass and antique silver.\nI wrote back to them on March 11th saying to remove the brass information, that no brass is wanted, just the brushed metal effect.\nAnd that's it. No new edits, no communication since March 11th.\nI wrote to Chris Clark, my Design Coordinator, 2 work days ago and no response either.\nI've wasted an entire month on this process.\nI feel like this is a fake company who spends a little bit of time moving around logos and then abandoning orders, pocketing the rest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:58:23.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

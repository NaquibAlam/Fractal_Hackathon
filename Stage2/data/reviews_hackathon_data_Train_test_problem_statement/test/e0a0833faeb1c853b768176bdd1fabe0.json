The staff were incredibly rude and verged on aggressive when trying to get me to pay for added cover. As a female travelling alone, I felt threatened and forced into paying extra in order to set off before it got dark. The member of staff was talking about me in Greek and then lied repeatedly telling me made up figures about damage to cars and false facts about the policy i had already purchased Avoid this company!\nI have spoken to the customer service team there and they only say that the staff member was doing his job in ensuring I was aware of the dangers of driving. The fact that I was made to feel so uncomfortable that I had to repeatedly ask him to stop speaking to me in such a forceful way has not been apologised for in any way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:14:28.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

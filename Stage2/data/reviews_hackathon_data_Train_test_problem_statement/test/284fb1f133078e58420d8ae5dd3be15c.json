When I got my confirmation my name had been substituted with the name of a friend with whom I had travelled 2 years ago. I had booked a flight for the two of us back then.

When I called them immediately to explain the error they told me I would be charged $75 to remedy the error that I had obviously made. I argued at length but they refused to believe me. They eventually reduced the fee to $20 when I explained that my credit card company would go to bat for me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T16:45:54.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

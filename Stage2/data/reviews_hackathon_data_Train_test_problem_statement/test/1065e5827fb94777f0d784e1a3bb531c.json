All review sites have some much amount negativity about a company and not all positive as many only come on them to complain. Read between the lines on here.\nIF YOU DECIDE TO USE THEM PAY WITH PAYPAL ONLY. So when and it will do go wrong there is a back up.\nBanggood deliveries where in my opinion not too bad but the \"after support\" is totally disgusting and unbelievable the tricks they will try to avoid getting you a refund back....Only Paypal will support you if things go wrong.\nI received a phone which had a fault on it a few weeks before Christmas and I was informed to send the phone back to wait for it CHINA So I had to cough up the delivery costs to send back to China and even with a tracking number they made sure that no one collected it at there end until you send them emails to do it and paypal wanted them to do it come 15th February over 2 months later paypal forced a refund back as they could see it was returned.\nIf you want shoddy \"after sales\" support from CHINA then Banggood is for you otherwise just stick locally in your own country instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:03:57.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

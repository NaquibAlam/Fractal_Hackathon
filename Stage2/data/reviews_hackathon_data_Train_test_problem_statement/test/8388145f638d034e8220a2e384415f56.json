Not happy and won't have anything to do with them ever again.\nI put in an order for a relatively trivial little item on the 29th December. On the 21st Feb I was STILL waiting for it to arrive, despite several contacts, and various promises (none of which have been fulfilled).\nFor a start, I discovered they are one of those companies happy to sell stuff, but other than that, they make it extremely difficult to contact them. The 'Contact' page? Leads to a page with a form demanding you sign in or create an account.\nWhen you finally go through those shenanigans, you find there is no phone number, claiming this is a way to 'keep our costs low'.\nWorse - they want you to fill in forms with various prechosen subjects to choose from - bad luck if your issue doesn't fit. And no 'seriously unhappy, cancel this order!' is not one of them. Whereas 'my product came with a US plug' is. Interesting.\nSo, no direct email and no phone number (Translation - \" we don't want to pay anyone, let alone bother to staff a helpline\").\nIn order to even contact you, I had to go through all sorts of effort to track down an email address.\nNow I picked them to buy from what I thought was a local business, as the other sellers (eBay etc) were in places like Hong Kong.\nFunny, that.\nTurns out so is Fishpond's 'seller'.\nSeller?\nFirst I heard of a seller was AFTER I placed the order.\nI've been and checked - they talk of 'working with sellers all over the world'. But they do NOT explain that the business model is pretty much like eBay['s, but without the protection and support you get with eBay. So turns out the order is to be filled by someone with a hotmail address... hardly confidence inspiring. And it doesnt come.\nFirst it was supposed to come around the end of Jan. Then it was arriving the first week of Feb. That turned in the second, which then became something like 'this coming week'. By which stage I am fed up. I am never ever buying anything with them again.\nStill hasn't come\nLast time I contacted them, they said they are 'contacting the seller directly' (which is what they said last time) and suggested I do the same.\nWell, no. I bought from them. Their resonsiblity as far as I (and the law) is concerned.\nI've now given them 48 hours to process a refund, or I'm lodging a card dispute with Visa.\nAnd all this for something I could have bought from a high rated seller off eBay.\nI hope they know that Amazon is ramping up its activity here this year? They will eat Fishpond for lunch. And deserve to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:07:55.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

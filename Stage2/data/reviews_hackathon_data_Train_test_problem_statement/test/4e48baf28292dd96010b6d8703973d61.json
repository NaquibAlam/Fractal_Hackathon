After waiting for 40 days, I followed up with them to see why my item hadn't shipped. They kept asking me to wait a few more days. After waiting for an additional 6 days, I demanded my money back and to cancel the order. They said all they can do in the short term was to credit my account with \"dino dollars\". I had no intentions of ever using that site again. I said I wanted a full refund back to Paypal. The person \"helping\" me said she couldn't do that. It would take a minimum of 10 business days for a full refund. After reading reviews from other people who agreed to that option and never got their money, I decided to dispute the charge with Paypal. I got an email 2 days later from Dinodirect that they wouldn't fight the charge back. They also didn't consent to the dispute either. So I had to wait a full 10 days for Paypal to resolve the matter. I got my money back, but it took a long time. Dino direct is quick to charge you, but they'll fight you every step of the way to get your money back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:08:08.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It got worse. Firstly, they dumped my order outside a busy city apartment block and didn't tell me over a Saturday night. I inquired about this and they ignored my email. The portion sizes are tiny. I found myself having to cook up extra things even though I was cooking for 2. The products are not fresh as they would go off about 2 days later. They give you tiny portions of meat. It's not worth the money- I can google recipes that are better for less money. Really disappointed as I was excited to try this! Cool idea- poor service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:55:22.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

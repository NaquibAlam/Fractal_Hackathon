Furniture itself very good for the price and we are very happy with that. One little issue with faulty handles but new ones being sent so problem resolved easily. All good to that point.\nDelivery was another experience, on time but no call to say they would be with us soon, no pleasantries in fact hardly a word spoken and couldn't work out if they were in a bad mood or just rude. One item was skidded up the drive and then rolled several times the rest of the way, when there were 2 delivery staff that could have easily carried it. I caught it all on CCTV and sent footage but it doesn't seem to have been taken too seriously. The furniture was luckily undamaged due to excellent packaging. There was a fragile symbol, luckily no glass to break otherwise could have been a different scenario. It was taken to a room of choice, where it was all left upside down despite clear which way up arrows.\nMaybe 2 stars is a bit harsh but my purchase of nearly Â£700 was disrespected.\nConclusion great furniture and seller but probably best to collect in person. Avoid courier until they get issues resolved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:33:54.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

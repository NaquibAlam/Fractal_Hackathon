I would have also liked to know IF I could use my AAA discount! But I got nothing!\nAfter I made this post, they contacted me and told me that AAA is not available at this hotel OR it would have been offered, it would have been available to me reserving this way. The other thing they told me is that IF I wanted a specific type of room I needed to contact the hotel the day of or day before to see IF it would be available. I'm still not happy BECAUSE having a type of room is what MOST hotels offer WHEN making the reservation! I'm still not satisfied!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T13:04:55.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

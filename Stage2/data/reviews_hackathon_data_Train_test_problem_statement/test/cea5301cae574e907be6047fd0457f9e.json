ProBikeKon can claim the product isn’t counterfeit or faulty ! ProBikeKon can pretend to help me out and accept the goods back !!\nHowever the fact still remains, I am the consumer that has bought and paid for non genuine, not as described product and what ever solution ProbikeKon “NOW\" offer only after posting this review.\nI as the consumer will still be without the goods and it will cost me money to return the goods for the privilege of what ProBikeKon call a solution !! How does that work. At this stage all I can suggest to perspective purchases is, please be very careful of ProBikeKon. If anything changes I will only be to happy to post the outcome.\nMy experience with ProBikeKon would have to be the worst I have ever encountered with any online store ! I believe that the product is counterfeit - Fake - Not the real genuine product ! With Fake products out of Asia comes the sizing problem that goes along with the cheap product, everything is two sizes to small. The embroidery, badges and logos are already falling off and the product is so small I can't even wear it. I am a size Small to Medium frame, I ordered a Large! It is the equivalent size to an Extra Small ! I would need to order an XXLarge in this fake product to fit. On top of this, I have contacted ProBikeKon several times to discuss an outcome and they have not had the decency to responded ! No communication at all to try and resolve the problem. I will never use them again with that kind of follow up support or should I say lack of follow up support.

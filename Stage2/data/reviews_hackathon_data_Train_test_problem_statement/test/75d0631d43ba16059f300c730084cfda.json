I guess only thing that got me frustrated was the delivery and additional warranty that was offered. The manufacturers warranty was not good, considering that if anything happens to the merchandise I will have to physically bring the furniture to the store? Which is not a good service experience.\nOverall I was happy with the furniture and have not gotten it delivered yet so, look forward to enjoying the pieces in my new home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:28:28.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

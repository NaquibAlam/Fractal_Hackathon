This time the vehicle I purchased came from up north. I feel that if you know that a vehicle has snow or ice damage underneath it don't sale it to anyone!! I've had to put the vehicle in the shop twice in 6 months!!!! Then I was told it's my responsibility to insure that the repair shop contact them about fixing my vehicle. What am I making payments on a LEMON for!! Make sure you also check your interest rates. At this purchase, the price of my vehicle doubled!! I will NEVER purchase from them again!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:46:37.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

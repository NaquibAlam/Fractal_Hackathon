Never had an issue. Perfect items every time. This time however amongst my order was Leinster rugby lunchbox and it arrived broken. It was for my son who was starting Playschool. Customer service were fantastic. They had none left in warehouse so they organised for a shop to send directly to me. So nice to deal with people who actually care about their customers.

PM_1010335_1011216. First they repeated what was on the PM trace page. Then when I wanted more, they said it went to a processing center to be re-labled and shipped overseas. But that was six days ago and when I pointed out that the processing and air shipment should have taken only two days at most and thus package not moving for at least four days so I wanted to know why. The chat person never came back to say anything so I terminated chat after 30 minutes of nothing. Activated a second chat with different gent saying I needed to track a missing package. But after I gave her the tracking number she never came back on line at all. Obviously they do not have an effective way to find out the status of a package so I am not happy with their service and will likely not ever use it again. Others cost more but are reliable and trackable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:54:22.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

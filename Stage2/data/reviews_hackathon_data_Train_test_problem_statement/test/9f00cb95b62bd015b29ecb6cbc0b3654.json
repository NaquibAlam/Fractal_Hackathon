Unfortunately this was not enough. Unfortunately, he did not stick to collusion:\n- He had attended several guests at the same time. I have paid for myself as a solo traveler, but I had to share the bathroom and in the end I had no room at all and had to sleep in the living room.\n- He always called me wrong opening times and ways. I spend two weeks at Teheran, but could not visiting every place, because of wrong open times he told me and other traveler he hosts at the same time.\n- I needed to change the apartment during the trip because of construction work and other guests.\n- The appartment was very dirty.\n- He reacted to criticism not always friendly.\nOf course there were also good sides:\n+ The apartments are very centrally located in Tehran. The metro and buses are easily accessible. There are also many caf√©s and restaurants in the area. Sights are easily accessible.\n+ A real delicious breakfast and its very nice, attentive and good cooking woman.\nBut all in all I can not recommend this property: What I had agreed with him six months in advance was obsolete on the spot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:39:26.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

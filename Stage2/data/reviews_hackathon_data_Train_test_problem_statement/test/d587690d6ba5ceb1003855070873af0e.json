Our flight from London was meant to be early Friday morning so we have two full days away. Due the a flight reschedule our new flight from London was Friday evening. This means we have paid nearly Â£500 to have one day in Barcelona to then fly back Sunday lunchtime. After 12 phone calls in the last week, we are still waiting for a manager to call back. We are willing to fly earlier than the original booking or fly back on Monday. We have been completely flexible but as of yet we have had no response from anybody. Be warned....if they tell you they will respond in 3-4 hours they will not. You are always waiting 3-4 hours which actually means days!!! Feeling incredibly let down by this company. We have now lost money and a birthday is completely ruined. I don't expect any help from them and will never use them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T20:33:07.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

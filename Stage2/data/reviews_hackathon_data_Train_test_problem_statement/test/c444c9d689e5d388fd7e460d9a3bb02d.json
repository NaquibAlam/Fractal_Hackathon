The \"beef\" was not beef, and the chicken was slimy and also questionable as to where/what it came from.\nWhen I relayed my complaint to the customer service team I was met with hostility and arrogance.They advised that the food supplied on their website was not their responsibility, and that I would have to register my complaint with the IFSA. I pushed back as I was their customer and not interested in registering a complaint, I simply wanted a simple refund for the food I paid for that I could not eat.\nI eventually got a refund for the dish that had human hair in it, but they have still refused to tell me where the \"beef\" was sourced, and when I questioned what they would offer for the fact the I was left with no edible food, and hungry that evening, they replied that the restaurant had refunded the chicken dish as a \"gesture of goodwill\".\nThey clearly take no responsibility for the restaurants on their website as there was no offer of a refund on the other dish (that tasted like fish when it was supposed to be beef); the driver fee; or even a courteous voucher to apologise for the inconvenience.\nAbsolutely socking service from a reputable company. They clearly need to vet their suppliers more, and brush up on their customer service.\nStill have not reached a resolution and they are now not responding to my emails.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:16:30.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The order was placed at 17:25 and I received an email and text that said the food would be delivered at 18:10. I order from this place weekly as I love their butter chicken but usually order from JustEat. I heard marvin.ie has a good loyalty program so I decided to try them. Well this turned out to be a bad decision. With JustEat, the food arrives within 30-40 minutes and arrives nice and hot. With marvin, the food arrived 25 minutes late (so over an hour after delivery) and arrived cold. Thankfully I chose to pay by cash so just sent the driver away with his cold food.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T15:55:47.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

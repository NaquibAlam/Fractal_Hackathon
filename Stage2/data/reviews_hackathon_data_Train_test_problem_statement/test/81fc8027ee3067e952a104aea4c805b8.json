It is now over 5 weeks later (6 after placing order) and still no frames. Contact customer service and told that they would need to confirm status with the buyers and they would update me by email within 24 hours.\nThey have my money, I do not have my frames after 6 weeks. I will be interested to see what else they have to say. But, right now I would not recommend this company.

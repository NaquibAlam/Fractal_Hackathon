Upon arriving we were told no such reservation existed! The owner showed us an Interhome list showing other travellers for half of the stay and no record of ours. A great start...\nInterhome promised to sort it out and find alternate accomodation, initially they arranged for us to stay for four days as the appt was available. For the remainder they suggested three properties, the closest a 50km drive from were we were. Not acceptable in my mind however a solid solution in theirs! Ultimately we found alternate accomodation on our own for the remainder and Interhome agreed to refund the unused part and pay the balance of the difference. My beef with Interhome is that beyond searching their own database of appartments they did not put in much effort to find something. Basically we were left on our own to find a proper solution. Financially their proposals were ok.\nThe appartment itself was perfectly fine. Quite spacious. Well priced. Although a little far from the center of Kappl which meant ski buses that don't run as often as those in the center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:15:13.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

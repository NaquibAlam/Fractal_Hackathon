I received the order confirmation, and tracking information, with expected date of delivery. On the actual day, I looked to see where my packed is, just to find out they printed the wrong address on my package. I continued to call their customer service, and kept getting the automated voice. When I finally got a hold of a person on 01/19, they told me it was my address was too long. My issue is, how come their system didn't shorten my address to make my package deliverable?? Then when I asked can I get it re-delivered, she told me they don't have my shoe in stock any more. I was wondering if it was ever shipped out in the first place.

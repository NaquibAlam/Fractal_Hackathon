This had to be a present for the 8th of February, that looks to me enough prevision considering that I bought it on the 26th of January. It did not arrive yet, so you can imagine that it supposed to me a very embarrassing situation. It's is not a 2€ present that can be substituted by another.\nI am surprised that even buying it on the 26th of January and paying the urgent transport to have it here in 3-7 days the company did not deliver it yet (9th of February). Now I know that I will receive it (supposely, as it is said in DHL) on Friday 10th of February.\nWhen I received the email explaining about the Chinese New Year Holiday (that I never had a notice before; otherwise I could consider in a first instance to buy it or not) you still had some days to deliver it on time. Again it had to be a 3-7 days delivery. If by your side there's an inconvenient with a national holiday you should make an appropriate effort to reduce your delivery to meet the dead line of your offer.\nThis situation is completely unacceptable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:04:24.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

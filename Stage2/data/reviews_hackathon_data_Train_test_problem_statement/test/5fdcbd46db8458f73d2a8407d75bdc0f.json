I've had this warranty service for over a year and this was my first time using it. I called CHW on Monday, the contractor called within an hour and scheduled the appointment, and the problem was resolved on Thursday! The contractor kept me abreast of his arrival and when he came, he assessed the problem, told me what needed to be done, and collected my co-pay. In 30-45 minutes, he show me what he did to resolve the problem and was on his way!\nKudos to Choice Home Warranty and their excellent service!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:24:46.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

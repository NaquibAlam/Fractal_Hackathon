While I love the concept of ordering a new outfit a month, there are some major issues that Fabletics needs to address:\n1. Prices have gone up. You used to be able to get 3 piece sets for 49.95, now you cannot, or I haven't seen it. Majority of the sets fall in the 59.95 price range, they used to fall in the 49.95 price range\n2. Constantly out of stock, an organization like this should know their database, how many customers they have, and how many projected orders they will have per month...forecast, yet every single month they are out of stock or running low on stock. Unacceptable.\n3. Quality. Some orders I am so happy with the material and quality, others the pieces are cheap, thin, and not sewn well together. I ordered a pair of leggings (I have always ordered a Small with no problem) and wore them 2-3 times before they had a huge hole in the crotch.\n4. The recent I have no canceled is because I have heard that it is an absolute pain to cancel...I don't feel like dealing with it, so I skip most months...on the off chance that I can find a Small outfit in stock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:57:45.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was very pleased with my Bonfire Patio Peach. It has an excellent shape and good size. It was for a gift, and I was very happy with it. The Bonanza Peach was for my deck and does not have nearly as nice a shape. It looks more like the top was lopped off and the small branches go to one side from there. I hope it will shape up as it grows.

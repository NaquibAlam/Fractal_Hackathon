Also there is no benefit to having a high score where other companies will provide you with money back for good driving.\nThe current customer service system is just terrible and its designed for them to contact you at their convienence without any warning at all. I was owed a refund and they insisted that I contact them, when I didn't they sent me a cheque out for the refund, I fail to see why they couldn't do this in the first place instead of insisting I contact them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T09:04:27.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

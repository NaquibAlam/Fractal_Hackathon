Should Trustpilot be allowed to engage in ruining businesses, effecting jobs? No!\nI have requested for their complaints procedure and CEO details, all of which have been ignored.\nHowever, if you pay Trustpilot, they will make sure your company stays at the top of the list, don't pay them and they treat you like trash.\nI think it;s about time someone investigated them, it's also funny how they report their own reviews and can be in control of their own website when they are the ones who set their own guidelines....

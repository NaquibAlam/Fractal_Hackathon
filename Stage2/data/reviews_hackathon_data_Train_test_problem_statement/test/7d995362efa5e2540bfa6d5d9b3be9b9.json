I made a purchase for a cazal legend frames, after I made the purchase I receive several email, requesting my identification. I sent several emails of proof and still kept getting emails, \" saying my account has been flagged\". After several nerve wrecking phones to the company, the matter was resolved. I went online to check the status of my purchase and their was not evidence showing that I had actually made a purchase from this company, even though the money was taken from my card. I made a call to the company and was told the product was out of stock but to date the product is still available for purchase online. How is that even remotely possible. When I contacted the company all I got was sorry for the inconvenience.

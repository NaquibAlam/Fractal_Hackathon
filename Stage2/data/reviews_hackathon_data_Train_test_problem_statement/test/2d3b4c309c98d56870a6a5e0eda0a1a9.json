After perusing their excellent website and ordering my choice I had a change of mind, and decided on a different keyboard - same price. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at BetterMusic, and my order was changed without fuss, and delivered to my door a couple of days later in great condition. Very happy with our new Casio AP460 Digital Piano, and would recommend BetterMusic to anyone looking for musical instruments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:53:56.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

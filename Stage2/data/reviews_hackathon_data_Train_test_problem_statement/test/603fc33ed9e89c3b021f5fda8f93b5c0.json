We were advised we would need a credit card in the name of the driver to cover any other costs. When we arrived in Fuertuventura we collected the keys from Goldcar.\nThe rep asked us for our credit card to pay a deposit. We explained that our understanding was that we had paid all costs in full at the time of booking. The rep advised that the extra costs of e205.94 which were now required were company policy in regards to fuel and other damage deposit, and formed part of the conditions of the booking. We queried the amount as this seemed excessive to cover fuel for a small car for a week, but the rep assured us this was correct and guaranteed that this cost would be refunded IN FULL to our credit card on return of the car with a full tank and in good condition. We made it clear to her that we did not require any extra cover regarding insurance or fuel, as we had already paid, but the rep also made it clear that we would not get our hire car without this extra payment. She did not breakdown the cost on the invoice and as it was in Spanish we had to take her at her word. We felt we had no choice but to enter our credit card, with the assurance that the monies would be refunded in full.\nWhen we returned the car, undamaged and checked with a full tank of fuel, we spoke to a different rep who assured us our deposit would indeed be repaid. When home, we received a notification of a return of Euro 92.00, leaving a shortfall of Euro 113.94.\nThe situation is further compounded by the fact that we were obliged to have a credit card in the drivers name with an 1100 credit allowance to allow us to have the car with no extra cost for insurance. We do not have credit cards, we only use cash and debit - but did this in order to comply.\nBecause we signed the form we have no way of recovering the money.\nWe are extremely angry and disappointed that we appear to have been ripped off - and in our own opinion, probably the rep was on commission.\nNO WAY was it explained to us that we were in fact paying for extra souped up insurance which we did NOT need.\nPLEASE BE CAREFUL BEFORE SIGNING AGREEMENT AND ENSURE ANY COSTS ARE FOR FUEL ONLY", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:35:59.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

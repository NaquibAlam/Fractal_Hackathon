I contacted them TWICE on their contact form and emailed them and no response. I eventually got speaking to an online agent who told me she couldn't see anything from my email address. I even forwarded her the email and she still couldn't find it, even though they were able to email me directly. with the correct buyer's information!!!! To top it all off, they stalled the sale, contacted the buyer about how I had made a mistake and threatened to charge me if anything went wrong.\nFOR THEIR MISTAKES Absolutely AWFUL service!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:32:02.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

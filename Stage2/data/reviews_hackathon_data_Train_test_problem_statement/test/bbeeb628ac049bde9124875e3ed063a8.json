I.e. I paid £19.99 believe this was a one off payment - it wasn't ! I also had to pay £29.99 too ?!! So yes that's nearly £50 to unlock. Why not advertise £50 at the start?!! I think you know why :) b) it was inferred that it would take up to 48hrs then an email arrived saying 2-6 days ?!! I don't doubt that the provider will claim it was all in the small print many times, but bottom-line putting key detail like this in the small printed is totally unreasonable!

The HRM will not pair with the GPS unit, so I contacted PBK. I received an \"do not reply\" email with a reference number confirming their receipt of email and that they would be in contact within 48 hours. Well, it's a week later and no response! Very frustrating when you consider I receive emails from them about every second day promoting their products. I want to impress upon them that customer service is super important, especially when there are so many other companies that are fighting for the same dollar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:43:16.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They didn't ship for over a month, even though they charged me when I placed the order. They also didn't send me a notice when the items did ship, so I had to keep going back to the website to try to track down the status of my order. You can't link from the order email directly to the tracking page, you have to re-enter everything. It was just a big pain to manage this gift. A few automated emails from them with an estimated and actual shipping date would have made my experience much easier. Also, don't charge my credit card until you ship the product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:29:17.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

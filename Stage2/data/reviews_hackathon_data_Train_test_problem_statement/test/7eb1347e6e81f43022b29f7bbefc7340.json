The address was indeed correct, and I requested a refund due to my partner's Valentine's Day being ruined by this error.\nI had no communication or offer of help. I found that my request was closed without response because today I received a survey request on my experience with their 'support'. What support? No one helped me. No one checked in to assure me everything was/would be taken care of or to apologize. Just a cold closed ticket and a slap to the face for wasting my time and money with them.\nI will never purchase from here again because they make it obvious they do not care about their customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:47:57.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

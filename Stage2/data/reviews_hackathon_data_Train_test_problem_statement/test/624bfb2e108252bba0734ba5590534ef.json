SCAM or extremely poor customer service is what the readers can decide for themselves. I want them to know how my family was affected by a situation caused by FlightHub. As bizarre as it is, it is the truth. My daughter purchased her round trip flight to New Zealand months ago from the FlightHub website. Here goes:\nMy daughter called me today from Toronto International Airport at 12:30 pm Valentine’s Day Feb 14th, 2017 her flight was at 1:45 pm and at this point she hadn’t gotten through security. She was emotionally distraught and crying telling me she didn’t know what to do that her hard earned money (approx. $3,000) and dream vacation were gone. She had been standing, since 10 am, in front of United Airlines where you check-in your bags. United Airlines would not accept her tickets she purchased from FlightHub she was told that they were corrupt. She been on the phone with FlightHub, since 10 am, trying to resolve the problem, she kept being put on hold by a FlightHub rep asked to speak to a Supervisor. Even the FlightHub Supervisor kept putting her on hold and then refused to reissue her tickets. The United Airlines representative tried to help and called FlightHub same thing he was put on hold when he finally got to speak to a FlightHub Supervisor he got the same response. “FlightHub was not going to reissue her tickets and/or refund her money.”\nI was so upset to hear my daughter crying on the phone. She had been so excited and looking forward to this trip of a lifetime spending a month travelling in New Zealand. Thanks to FlightHub everything for her was being ruined. I called FlightHub and talked to a representative who kept putting me on hold. This rep told me there was nothing wrong with my daughter`s tickets and she had boarded the plane. I knew for a fact that this information was incorrect so I replied that was there is no way that my daughter was on that plane because I just spoke to her she hadn’t even passed thru security. Her plane she was supposed to be on was leaving at 1:45pm. I asked to speak to a FlightHub Supervisor, the customer rep kept putting me on hold, coming back to the phone several times told me the Supervisor would tell me the same thing told me she was going to hang-up. I pleaded with her to speak to a FlightHub Supervisor (in the end I never did get to speak to a Supervisor). While I was on hold, I called Air New Zealand to find out if my daughter was on the plane. I was told she wasn`t. By this time, my daughter had missed her flight this was confirmed by Air New Zealand. The Air New Zealand representative tried to contact FlightHub to no avail. Keep in mind while talking to Air New Zealand, I was still on hold waiting to speak to a FlightHub Supervisor. Air New Zealand told me to hang up on FlightHub call my daughter and have her go to Air Canada to check in for a flight that left at 4pm today going to Houstan TX to catch the connecting Air New Zealand flight. Long story short, my daughter caught the 4pm Air Canada flight with little time to spare and when she landed in Houstan at 6:38 pm allowing her only a few minutes to go outside of the Security Zone to collect her check-in bag, go back through Security then go from Terminal A to Terminal D to catch her Air New Zealand flight at 7:55 pm. Many thanks to Air New Zealand for helping my daughter with a problem that FlightHub created. I understand that ever situation is different.\nMy daughter is not a world traveller and has only flown a couple of times. FlightHub has managed to ruin her vacation by causing a traumatic experience; she has had no food or time to eat from 10 am until her in flight meal tonight with Air New Zealand.\nThanks to FlightHub starting her vacation like this, I know for sure that my daughter is going to feel anxious and worried about what will happen next and her flight home not knowing if her tickets are corrupt until she get to the New Zealand airport. Her vacation is now ruined. I am still feeling the emotional affect of this day I can only imagine how my daughter must feel. FlightHub do you have any idea and/or care about the grief you caused our family today. If this is any example of how FlightHub operates its business, readers should consider themselves warned. If this happened to my daughter it could very easily happen to someone else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:01:08.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

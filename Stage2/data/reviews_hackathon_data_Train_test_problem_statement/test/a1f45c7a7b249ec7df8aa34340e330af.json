I did all the right things and KV Supply dropped the ball. I ordered an expensive Rx for my dog, one he just started and will be taking the rest of his life - at least several years. Placed the order with all the correct Vet information so they could fax for an Rx. The next day I received an email saying a \"package\" from your order has shipped. Great, just what I wanted to here after reading negative reviews, but took a chance anyway. I WAS WRONG! A week later no package. I checked the email again and what the shipped \"package\" was, was a coupon sent by email. Sorry, but that is not a package. I should have read the email more carefully the first time. I called and spoke to customer service who said they would check on the order with the pharmacy and get back to me. I waited all day, no response. I called back late in the day and customer service told be that the Vet has not responded. !) I find that hard to believe, I called the Vet the day I placed the order to give them a heads up. 2) Why didn't someone contact me over the past 9 days? So my order was just sitting there until I followed up today. I had to cancel the order and will be getting the medication from my Vet at nearly double the price. BTW my vet and their staff is very good about recording communications they receive, I picked up the medication I needed today and they had no request from KV for an Rx. I should have trusted the reviewers. I took a chance because I saw that the Sales manager had actually responded to most of the negative reviews. I thought that was a good proactive move on her part. Looked her up on Linkedin and she has been with the company 17 years. I thought I'd give them a chance. Now I'm here writing a negative review and will post it elsewhere. I also discovered the pharmacy they are using as of Jan 2017 is called Pets Choice, run by Lambert Pet Supplies aka Lambriar who has a history of supplying puppy mills. How did KV get involved with them and was there no vetting process. All in all, shopping for pet medications online has left a bad taste in my mouth. Unfortunately there seems to be no reputable suppliers online.

At 17.00 I received a text saying they were delivered and my friend's husband said there's no one and nothing. 40 minutes later the flowers have arrived. Question - how is that sms service working and what was those 40 minutes for?\nThere is no one to address your question to, if it's outside the working hours. So you just sit in another country and wondering what's happening over there.\nAnd if the client is ordering in English, maybe it'd be a great idea to send the sms also in English, not Swedish.\nOn the picture that my friend sent me the color of the flowers was completely different pink than it was on the website. Not even talking about the bouquet size.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T12:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:36:16.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

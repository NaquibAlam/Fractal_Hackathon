My car was collected early and I was told it would be back between 4-6pm. A driver would bring it back once I paid the bill. No problem.\nInvoice came through about 3pm and paid online immediately. I then waited and waited, 6pm came and went and no car. I had to go out so thought they were running a little late so would drop it off and put the key through the door. Arrived home at 11pm, still no car.\nI called the garage first thing this morning to be told they hadn't received confirmation of payment from Service Stop and in fact they had 2 other cars still at the garage for the same reason. They would not bring my car back until they had payment. To say I was unhappy is an understatement. Service Stop phone line doesn't open until 10am so I was stuck.\nCar eventually brought back mid-morning with an apology from the driver. It's not his fault but not having my car back the same day was simply not acceptable.\nDefinitely won't be using again or recommending to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:25:41.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

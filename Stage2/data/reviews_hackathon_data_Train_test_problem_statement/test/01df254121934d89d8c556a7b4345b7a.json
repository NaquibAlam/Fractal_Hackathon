When the email arrived it said expect the delivery in 3-4 business days. These are generic texts and are not adjusted to reflect any delay which would be caused by one of the items in order not being in stock.\nIf it had been made clear in the basket that the 2nd item would hold up the delivery (as other online shops do), I could have chosen another item.\nIf they had made it clear in the confirmation email the estimated delivery was 8-10 days, I could have got in touch to change my order.\nBut because I was under the impression everything was ok and on time, it wasn't until it was too late to change my order and get my item in time. So I had to cancel my order and buy from elsewhere, which was a shame.\nAlthough this was my mistake, I think the whole thing wasn't very clear and thats why I gave a low score.\nI hope this helps other people shopping to be careful to take note of the shipping text under the add to basket button. I hope blue tomato can update their site to make it clearer for their customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:11:14.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

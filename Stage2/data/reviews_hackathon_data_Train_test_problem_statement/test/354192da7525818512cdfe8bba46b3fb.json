Return the car, get home, told we've been charged for late return and also over mileage.\nNever once was it clear on the site for limited mileage, it's down in the small print/terms - should be much clearer really considering most rental companies allow you to drive their car like a normal car, as much as you want.\nUPDATE: They say they are happy to look into the matter however when posting this original review I had already had a couple e-mails back and forth yet they ignore most of my valid points such as the fact I called them to extend the rental and they processed it.\nThey are unprofessional thieves and con artists at the end of the day.

They are also very quick in their delivery time which was huge for me because I tend to order at the last minute due to not making it a priority lol so I've really appreciated that. Also, like I said they had the best, fullest and truest flavors I could find. But, the last batch of orange candy tasted way off from the original time I bought it. It tasted almost like it was menthol or had something bad in it that reacted in a bad way... something I have never experienced with any of the many vape shops I've purchased from. I decided to give them another try and same exact thing!! Plus my blueberry is doing it, too! Which is very upsetting because I was looking forward to those flavors and the quality of flavors I received in the past. If there is something I did wrong in ordering please let me know.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:39:32.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

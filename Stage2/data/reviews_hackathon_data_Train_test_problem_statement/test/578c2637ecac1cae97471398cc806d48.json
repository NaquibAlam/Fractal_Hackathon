I sent all my books in one box. Was told all packages were processed within three days. Two weeks later I received an email saying by box was processed and it was missing one of the books. When I questioned it they didn't respond and just sent me a check for the three they said they received. A couple days later I received my book back in the mail. The paperwork with it was for some other book. Their customer service was pretty bad to not even know they had my book. They never answered any of my concerns about the delay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T09:26:31.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

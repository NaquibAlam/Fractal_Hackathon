We started hello fresh once we got back from our honey moon. We both have enjoyed it so much! The perfectly portioned meals for two and the convince of it being delivered to our doorstep has been wonderful! The fact that the hubby thinks I'm an amazing cook is 90% in thanks to hello fresh! They make it easy to cook! We also love how it gets us together. He reads me the directions and I cook! It is a perfect 30-45 mins to chit chat together about our day and then sit down and enjoy a healthy cooked meal. I love that hello fresh is the best quality of ingredients and the recipes are so delicious!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:36:35.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

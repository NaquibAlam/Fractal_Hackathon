The site gave us a selection of possible takeaways, we selected one, after submitting the order I had to put the address of our B&B in again to double check if they were delivering. All was good, food was supposed to be with us in 45 mins.\nI rang the number supplied with my order when the food was 30 mins late. The person on the phone was extremely rude, telling me the driver was on his way. I asked if the food would still be warm at this stage and he told me it would as he knew when the driver left. I reckoned he must have left late already. When the driver finally arrived quite some time later he asked for extra delivery charge as he felt we were too far out. Since we are not from here there was no way we could have known this but I expect the website to ensure a good match. I also expect the takeaway to ring and cancel or to ask for extra charge upfront and tell us that it will be later in such a situation. I was very disappointed with the entire experience.\nFood was mediocre at best so it didn't make up for it in any way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:56:03.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

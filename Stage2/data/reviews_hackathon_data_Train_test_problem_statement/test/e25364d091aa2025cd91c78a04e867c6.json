A week came and went with a phone call promising it today then tomorrow then the following week. Phone calls consisted of lies told by James and workers, they tried to call me for delivery, James was going to personally pick one up, they had a chest but it was damaged, ... Called 3 weeks later, fed up demanding my chest and was told a new one would have to be ordered and it would be another 3 weeks! Demanded my money back but miraculously received a chest the next day by another manager Scott something who says he had to go to Daytona to get it. Thank goodness my husband was home during time of delivery because he had to help the driver haul the chest up the stairs. The store has totally loss my business and acquaintances as well!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:06:29.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

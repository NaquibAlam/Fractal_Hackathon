I was told that one of the colors was in stock, the others would be back ordered 1-2 weeks. No problem, I put the order in. The first pair shows up, great. Then I get an email saying that the other colors are back-ordered and they won't be in for 3-4 weeks. So I call to see if I can move the return time I have for the first pair until I get the other colors, but the customer service person tells me that all the other colors are discontinued and I will never be receiving them (side note, they are not discontinued, the manufacturer has them on their website, so maybe their supplier can't get them, don't know, but when I bring this up the customer service person reccomends that I buy them on the manufactuers site which I will be doing). So just to recap, I do my due dillegence and this is what I got:\n1-2 weeks\n3-4 weeks\nDiscontinued.\nPersonally, I'm okay that they are discontinued, but it's the way this went down. Had I not called to ask about the return policy, I never would've found out they were discontinued and I would've just waited around. AND if they had told me the first time the other colors weren't available I never would've ordered any of the glasses, especially the one pair that I'm now on the hook to pay to return.\nI'm sure I'm the outlier here, I can see that they have lots of great reviews, but this is bad customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:18:48.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

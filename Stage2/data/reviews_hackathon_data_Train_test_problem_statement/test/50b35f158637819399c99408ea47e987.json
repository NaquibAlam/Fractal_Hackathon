Or should say \"part of my money\", because not only I lost customers and my orders were not shipped, but also I received from CurrencyFair 230 Euro less than I had sent them.\nAdditionally they accepted was their mistake first transaction (that I was charged 74 Euro), but would only return them (no compensation, just return the 74 Euro) if I accepted a total compensation of 150 Euros \"as good gesture\" for both transactions and cancel my claims to Ireland Finantial Ombudsman. Otherwise nothing.\nThis kind of blackmailing cannot be covered by any terms and conditions.\nThey say they are faster and cheaper than banks, but that's obviouslly false", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T11:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:08:19.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The monitor was very well priced ($385 w/promo code, vs $550 new) and shipped within a day or two of being ordered. It didn't come in original packaging, but the screen came in a custom thick bubble sleeve with no room to wiggle, while the rest of the components came wrapped in foam. The only issue at all was the front plastic cover on the monitor arm (the half circle with the red arrow pointing to the monitor rotation scale) popped off during shipping, but it popped back on easily. No dead pixels and the monitor looks great. Would definitely buy here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T21:11:47.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

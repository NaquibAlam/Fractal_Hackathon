For the umpteenth time, I had to pick up a package at a location just because they wouldn't ring my bell. 101% of the time, I am home. If I am paying for a delivery, then it is because I want it delivered to my house. Why do I have to stress myself to come over to a location again. I could have easily gone to the mall to get it. Today I saw the driver paste a note on the door without even trying to ring the bell. Then he dashed back into his truck. Here in Calgary, you guys need to purge your staff and train new ones to work efficiently. I'm highly disgusted by this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:30:59.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

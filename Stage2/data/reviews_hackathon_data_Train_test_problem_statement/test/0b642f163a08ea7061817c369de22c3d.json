They left my package twice in different place instead of deliverying it to my apartment. I think couriers have no idea what does it mean \"door to door\" delivery. Leaving package in working place without letting me know (just because there was the same name on the package with working stuff) - that suprised me. Thank God my boss was nice and informed me that one of the packages seems not to be related to work stuff and that probably was my privat order because he can see my apartment's address on it. And today - I got sms with information that I should pick up my package in portkiosken. I checked in system - courier wrote that I was not available. Interesting because I was in flat for the whole day waiting for package. I cancelled some meetings and changed my schedule to be able to pick up this package as I need it urgently. But well...all what the company can do now is rescheduling my delivery for wednesday, but I am pretty sure that my package will be again in some other place than my flat, so - no, thank you for such service and I will report the issue to the company which sent the package to me and I hope that maybe they will do something about it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:29:48.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

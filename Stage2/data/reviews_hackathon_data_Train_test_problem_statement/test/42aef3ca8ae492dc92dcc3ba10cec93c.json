This is an understatement. In bold red letters, you state the Intro Price is $12.97 for a sports bra. Then, in checkout, that \"Intro Price\" changes to $29.97. This is deceptive consumer practices. You cannot coax a customer into purchasing then change the price. If the customer does not double check, she would never know the price did not actually reflect the \"Intro Price.\"\nSecondly, the styles could be better. These dramatic prints cheapen the leggings. No one wants to look like they went to a tween mall store to purchase leggings. Furthermore, the popular styles are either out of stock or low quantity. The popular sizes are either out of stock or low quantity.\nThird, some of these styles are impractical. There needs to be a differentiation between styles intended to be worn in the gym and styles intended for athleisure.\nFourth, no one wants to be forced to be a VIP. You basically cannot make a purchase unless you are VIP member.\nThese are all the problems I noticed and it is my first purchase. Therefore, I am reluctant as to how long I will be a forced \"VIP member.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T23:34:01.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

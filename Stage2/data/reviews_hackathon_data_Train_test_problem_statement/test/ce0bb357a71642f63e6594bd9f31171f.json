They use misleading photos of products. The right hand doesn't communicate with the left. They're extremely unprofessional and disorganized. They don't return phone calls, and they don't process credits for returned merchandise. I ordered shelving online. It arrived 10-12 weeks later, really? They tried to charge me 4x the advertised price saying they had made a mistake. I returned the item for a full refund. Again, no communication. No credit. I finally received a full refund when American Express got involved and issued a credit. Last I checked, the item is still advertised for sale at the wrong price on their website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T20:57:32.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

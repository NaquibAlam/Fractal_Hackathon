I've never needed warranty on the living set that included sofa,love seat 2 end tables & 1 coffee table. but over time everything gets dated. I just moved into a 2036 sq ft home that need new everything from living room,dinning room,den,bedroom,office,kitchen & outdoor. I know people are saying whats the problem? the problem is When I say Don't step on the carpet even if I didn't say it cost me with padding $3,200.00+ and you step on it anyway. I didn't get the name of the African american but in other words the black man Who purposely stepped on it. theirs no way you can accidentally step on the carpet when the entrance is bigger than the furniture being deliverd, the vestibule or hallway where I specifically said to put the furniture so they don't get rain and mud in & on the carpet, but the black guy to me as to say I don't care what you wan't my job is to drop this crap off however I wan't regardless what you wan't this is my job so screw you. I never wan't to see him again on my property. I'm really considering getting a full refund & going somewhere else where the delivery personal as a whole represent the company as well as the sales persons. I will call Gardner White after work on March 27,2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:58:57.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Now bearing in mind that previous to this I had been on a losing streak of about 20 bets, then you wouldn't think this to be a problem.. Also, the pay-outs themselves were relatively small, the largest being a little over Â£200.\nHowever, this didn't stop me from getting an email from Paddy Power stating..\nThank you for your play with Paddy Power.\nHaving reviewed your account, we regret to inform you that with immediate effect we are no longer offering you any free bet promotions, double odds bonuses or enhanced prices.\nAs part of our Terms and Conditions, Paddy Power reserve the right to exclude customers from promotions.\nThis decision has been taken after careful consideration and will not affect your ability to bet on our Sportsbook or any other Paddy Power product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:53:50.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

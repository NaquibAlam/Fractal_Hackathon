It took them 2 hrs to pick us up at the cruise terminal (after 5 international calls to them) and when we arrived at their offices they had already rented our vehicle to someone else, despite the fact we had prepaid three months earlier! They offered us the van that had picked us up in, which they then had to take somewhere else to get insured for renting. The vehicle smelled musty, was in very poor condition and had extremely high mileage. They offered us one free day on our 8 day rental for the inconvenience as they had no other car for us. We refused to take it and asked for our rental to be cancelled. The manager, Vic Hodges, cancelled the booking and said we would have to get our refund from CarTrawler as they had my payment not Ace. There was no indication given that we would have any difficulty in being reimbursed our $910.00 CDN. We rented elsewhere and got a better condition vehicle at a lower price.\nGetting reimbursed for our original Ace rental has been a frustrating and unsatisfactory experience. Car Trawler are very difficult to deal with as each time you contact them you are handled by a different person. Eventually a Victoria took control and things looked more promising. However, the whole process took over 6 weeks and in the end was not resolved to our satisfaction in that we did not receive a full refund. Car Trawler maintained that Ace had had the funds all the time not Car Trawler and that Ace refused a refund to Car Trawler because we had turned down a “suitable” vehicle for no good reason. However, as a “gesture of goodwill” Car Trawler were willing to provide a partial refund of\n$610.00 CDN.\nSince this experience I have checked reviews of both Ace Rental Cars and Car Trawler. Of course it would have been better to have done this before I rented but I made my original booking through Hotels.com and since I have used them for many years for booking hotel accommodation and ben very pleased with the results I saw no reason not to trust them when it came to vehicle rental. Obviously I was mistaken.\nOn the website will find most reviews give a 1 or 2 out of 10 and many have similar complaints as mine.\nAnd the Consumer Affairs website lists “the top 287 complaints about Car Trawler.”\nIn short, do not book with Car Trawler or Ace Car Rental in Auckland bpossibly the worst experience we have ever had with a car rental company anywhere in the world. And Hotels.com should stop using Car Trawler as a car rental partner as well as stop recommending Ace Car Rentals in New Zealand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:23:43.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They charge also extra about 4 € for \"payment-fee\", no matter what kind of payment you are doing. Although this is common among others companys it makes me very angry.\nMore: they send two confirmations and its not clear why. In the second confirmation there is a button that you can check in with opodo. But in the very long list of flighcompanys MY company (German Wings) was not mentioned. The Helpline says, well German Wings and Eurowings are no the same Company, for that reason there is only Eurowings in the list, good do know! But in any case I can only check in 72 hours before flight - no information about this in the email which recomends the opodo-check-in-service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:57:41.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

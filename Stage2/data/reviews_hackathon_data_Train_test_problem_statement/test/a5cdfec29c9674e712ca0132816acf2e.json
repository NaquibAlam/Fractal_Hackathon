I booked a flight November 2016 through Bravofly. On 19/01/2017 I received an email saying there was a change in schedule. (The flight was cancelled and I was then booked on a later flight.) Unfortunately that will result in missing my connection flight. I told them on the 19th of January that I can't take the later flight and asked for a refund. I have written numerous emails, also asking to put me on an earlier flight. Today I received an email saying that they can't give me a refund. If I want an earlier flight, I will have to pay an airline penalty fee, agency handling fees AND airline fare difference! I have just realized that I have lost a lot of money. I gambled when I had used Bravofly. To save you a lot of trouble: DO NOT MAKE USE OF BRAVOFLY!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:14:37.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There were two offers, both at the same price but one included breakfast. I inadvertently clicked on the offer without breakfast and although I contacted Amoma immediately and explained my mistake and that it was going to cost an extra 112 euros, to pay for breakfasts for the stay, all they could say was that they \"couldn't\" change the booking despite it being only made a couple of minutes previously. Their only suggestion was that I contacted the hotel, who in turn told me they had to abide with the original booking. Customer service? Don't look for it at this company because from my experience, it's dead!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T16:51:57.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They do not take P O Boxes, which is frustrating because they get dropped off at the local PO. I don't get packages delivered to my home if it goes to the local post office. They get sent back. What a go around, 2.tried to change my delivery the first time around and once order is placed this is not an option( very irritating). After placing a second order, 3.I was able to track this and inconveniently had to drive to the local post office to get my package. ( which is out of my way). 4. Upon opening my packages I discovered I received four different kinds of curtains, total of eight with a width of 36. Four thick glossy foam backed curtains and four microfiber without the foam backing. I originally ordered only 4 panels that were suppose to be foam backed. 5.The four panels I ordered were suppose to be 80 length. Wow. I order a lot online and WILL NOT be ordering from groupon again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:35:37.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

While it's convenient and prevents food waste, it's a bit pricey and the meals can be hit or miss. The pictures of the meals look great online, but the taste of the meals aren't consistent. Also, if you want to cancel/deactivate your plan, make sure you do so 5 days in advance prior to your delivery and track your orders if you pause/unpause your subscriptions. Otherwise you might end up with and pay for a HelloFresh box that you do not want/need. Please note that HelloFresh will NOT send you a tracking email notifying you that your shipment was sent. Overall, I was disappointed with the customer service and my experience with HelloFresh, I tried calling and emailing them and never received a response, so I had to call again for clarification. This may be great for some people, but is not for everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:33:45.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

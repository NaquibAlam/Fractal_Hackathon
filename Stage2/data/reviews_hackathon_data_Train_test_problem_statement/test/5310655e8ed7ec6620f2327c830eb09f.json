A week after the booking was done i receive and email stating the reschedule of my flight. they had changed the flight leaving on friday and 6.30am to leave on friday at 5.30pm!!!! this is an 11 HOUR DIFFERENCE WHICH AFFECTS ME!!!! I Called last minute and they where NO HELP AT ALL they kept saying they will put the request in to see what they can do. i kept going round in circles and nothing was being resolved. I eventually asked for refund and to this this day i am still being tossed around. My flight is now this weekend and NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO HELP. THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND AGENCY HAS DONE NOTHING BUT BROUGHT STRESS TO MY LIFE!! BECAUSE OF THIS I WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO ATTEND THE IMPORTANT EVENT I HAD PLANNED AND LOOSE ALL MY MONEY.\nADVICE TO ALL - DONT BOOK THROUGH THIS COMPANY AS THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:09:35.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

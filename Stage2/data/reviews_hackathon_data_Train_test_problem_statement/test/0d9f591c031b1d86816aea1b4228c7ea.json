In the middle of making the sales rep, we were switched over to anther rep at the store. When one promised us one thing we couldnâ€™t find him when we were ready to check out so we had to wait until the manager got involved. We were told it would be at my home in a couple of weeks but it was pushed off several more weeks because the information they had told us, in the beginning, was incorrect at first. When finally giving us a date and time they came hours after promised however the people were really nice. (separate company) A few weeks after we had the bed, my husband noticed that a part of our bed was a different color. I called Nebraska and they sent me over to the warranty team just to be turned around again. This was after many phone calls, many hours spent trying to get a hold of the correct department and don't forget several unanswered emails. They had a technician come out and they wrote that they didn't see a difference. When he was taking pictures, I advised him that you can't really see it through the camera because its so close in color. Called back to get another tech out and again took pictures. Which made no sense to me because I told them that they can't see it with the flash. So when waking up one morning I noticed that I could get a clear shot of the different colors and did just that. I sent them the photos and they said that they would replace it out of courtesy for $71. I disagree. They said its been in my home for several months. I told them that this is a defect in bed not something I did and I have been trying to get this fixed for several months. I am going to email everyone I can and put this on all social media sites to make sure people know what they are getting themselves into when ordering from Nebraska. They also came out to look at pillows on my couch since they are falling apart and its been several weeks since I've heard from them to replace those as well.\nI have requested my communication from guardsman as well (warranty company) where they told me to go back to Nebraska..\nTo your response. I called them again yesterday. They still do not have a date that we will get our pillows or fix the couch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T23:02:12.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

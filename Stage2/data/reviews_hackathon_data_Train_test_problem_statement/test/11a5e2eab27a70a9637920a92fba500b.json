This past Monday at work water started leaking through the ceiling downstairs and water was flooding from the boiler upstairs, a Monday horror story. Called Pimlico expecting the Quote: to come out urgently to be really expensive, but not only could they get us someone quickly, but at a reasonable rate too. Darren arrived really quickly and calmly worked out the problem. It was a filter on the pipes. we needed a filter change or he could just fuse the pipe. I went for the filter change living in a hard water area and he went and got us a new one. fitted it really quickly and stopped the leak. charge was the agreed hourly rate + like £20/£30 for the filter and VAT. surprisingly reasonable and a great relief. I shall definitely use Pimlico again both at work and for home works.Highly recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:40:06.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Went to the store and the chain wasn't fixed. Therefore had to wait another week.\nI had a call after waiting more than 2 weeks to get my braclet back.\nThe young male staff member had problems finding my repair had to seek help from older female staff member.\nI had reservations when collecting my braclet and the way in which it had been fixed was different to how it had been before. I walked away and thought about whether to have it redone or accept the repair.. I did come back to the store on the same day and took my repaired braclet home.\nIn my opinion The female staff member was good the young male staff member was not so good in looking after a customer and accepting payments.\nPerhaps staff need to terrines how repairs are managed and how to accept payments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:59:01.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

In their defense, they kept me informed through emails and also shipped the 1 item out as soon as they got it in, splitting the order. But nonetheless I found it a subpar experience. What should happen is that the website indicates when the product will be delivered (and be truthful about it); failing that, there should be an immediate follow-up email with the option to cancel the order. Had I known how long it would take, I probably would have jumped to a different seller.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:58:10.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The only thing they provided me was the name of a company that provided services in my area. They gave me wrong phone numbers; told me my application was accepted when it was not; told me to make a payment when I could not (application had not been accepted); told me to expect phone calls which never came. I'm very disappointed. If they did their job well they could provide a helpful resource in the confusing mess of insurance. As it was they only further muddied the already cloudy water. They get a 2 / 5 stars as only 1 customer service person was helpful and greatly appreciated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:58:42.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

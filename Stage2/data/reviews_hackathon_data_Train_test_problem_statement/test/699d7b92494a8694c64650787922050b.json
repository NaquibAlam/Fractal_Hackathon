Got an email at 7:30 that it was on the way, left for fifteen minutes to get lunch and missed the delivery by three minutes at 1:36 (six hours later) I called them immediately. Got on hold for twenty minutes before being disconnected , only to call back for another ten minutes to be told that it would be shipped to a place 40 minutes away for me to pick up. Will never waste my time with this company again. Save your money and buy wine from a different company that has better communication and customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T23:34:05.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I know that I did not hit anything during my rental, but upon the inspection they found a 20 cent coin sized scratch on the front air foil and charged me 200 euros for the repair. I have my own insurance so I never take the insurance they offer as it is quite expensive and it seemed this was a bit of a punishment.\nAs I was extending my trip, I had to switch cars and create a new contract. I then went over the new car meticulously with their accident sheet and found 8 small scratches and dings that were the size of the one I had been charged for beyond the ones that they had listed on their sheet. They verified the notes and stamped it. So be very careful. Unless you take their expensive insurance (double the daily price of the rental), It is your responsibility to make sure that you record EVERY scratch, even the smallest ones, to be sure they don't charge you. It seems that this might be another way for Goldcar to generate extra revenue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:23:30.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

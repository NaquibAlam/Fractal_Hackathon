Two weeks before departure, Bravofly informed me that the airline had cancelled the flight. I called the Bravofly customer service regarding alternative flight. Surprisingly, they asked me to directly contact the airline to ask for an alternative flight option! And they kept telling me that full refund was entirely upon the airline. I had to make phone calls abroad to reach out for the airline central office for a refund as the alternative flight was not even an option (neither offered by Bravofly nor the airline).\nThe airline issued refund transaction document, which was collected personally by my brother from their central office. I forwarded the document to Bravofly customer service. But Bravofly keeps telling me that they are still waiting for the airline to initiate the refund and it can take up to number of months to get a refund.\nI contacted the airline regarding that claim, and the airline said that they have balanced the credit for my ticket payment, meaning that they have made a transaction to the Bravofly, so is apparently Bravofly that has confiscated my money more than 8000 Danish krones.\nWhen I complained to Bravofly, the ONLY thing that they say and do is to say 'sorry', which doesn't do any good to me, as I have lost my money, time and holidays. Bravofly even charged me 1 DKK per minute for making phone calls to them to get my money back (and still haven't received after 10 days). When I ask about the insurance, they ask me to contact the insurance company for getting my money back!! The funny part is that the customer service of the insurance company is also part of Bravo team!!! AND Bravofly has told me in an email, that they will reduce a handling fee of 20 euros from money! A handling fee for doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!\nTERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE\nSHAME ON YOU BRAVOFLY", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:05:10.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

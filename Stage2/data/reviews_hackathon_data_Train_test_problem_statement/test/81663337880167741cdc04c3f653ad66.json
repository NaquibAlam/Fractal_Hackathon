I contacted beach camera about what to do, their reply was send the SD cards back to us and reorder the Micro SD cards so I did.

NO, I am sorry how can we make things right with you. I explained to beach camera my family were leaving for vacation and need of the memory cards for some new recording devices we were taking with us and had already wasted two weeks of time trying to get the micro SD cards.

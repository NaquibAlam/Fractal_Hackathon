Great communication,Well done homestay ! First time using it, found accommodation after sifting through a few & found one I liked the look of the most, regards location, accommodation,price.\nThink it's safer to have a \"go between\" although it is up to your own gut instinct in the end which is why I rated a 4. As you've no idea about who your staying with Really !\nDon't know if younger, single or more vulnerable people could do with factual info from people who actually know the host ? I made it my business to look for the host on other sites & found them on trip advisor which was a great comfort to read reviews from others & put me much more at ease.\nThe host has already arranged transport for us from the airport & also for when we continue on to another part of Cuba at a fraction of the cost of our travel agent ! Thanks very much Homestay !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T23:48:31.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The engineer asked for fault code & when I told him he asked me what that meant. He hardly spoke any English. Looked @ boiler then started to walk out the door without any info on what was wrong. I asked him,we needed a pump, he would come possibly Friday. Only to be told as we have bad weather he couldn't get part so Monday next time. I've got a 3 yr old so needed heating. I sourced a part myself with 7 miles of my property and had to pay an engineer to fix it.

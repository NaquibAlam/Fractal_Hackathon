All went ok, however, payment credit card details could not be processed. Tried twice and then gave up. Assuming the booking was therefore not validated, went to another Company to make travel plans. Some time later I received booking confirmation and flight emails from Travelgenio, so contacted Customer Service via their web site email, to advise the circumstances and booking cancellation. No response to this, so phoned to confirm. Apparently there is a cancellation fee of EU$30, which I objected to, in the circumstances. All to no avail, as the operator advised they could not cancel the booking until I agreed to the fee.\nI also seem to recall that there was a cool off period for free cancellation of the booking. Obviously passing on my credit card details has put me in a no win situation with this Company. Refers Booking code 6G911Y.\nBe very careful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:18:53.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

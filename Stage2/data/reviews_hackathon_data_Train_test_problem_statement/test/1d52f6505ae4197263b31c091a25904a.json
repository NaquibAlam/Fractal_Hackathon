In reality there is a big \"made in China\" sticker on the back of it :( I've never had so many emails and phone calls in my life to discuss the delivery of anything! They company insisted that I could arrange a date that was convient for me. Not true at all! The delivery company makes 2 deliveries a month \"in this direction\" and insisted on delivering this long awaited sideboard Christmas Eve! I had over 30 people coming to my house that day and said that will not work. Well then you'll have to be put on hold and wait until it is convenient for us to deliver to you during our twice a month delivery. Which then became January. The piece was paid for and ordered in October mind you. I was told the delivery men were to bring the piece in and set it where I wanted and unwrap it. They came in dumped it, and left. It took my husband and I to unbox and unwrap the item together. Then we found the made in China sticker. My husband was upset. I had spent nearly 600 on this item that was obviously not the quality I had expected. Needless to say I will not be ordering from this company again.

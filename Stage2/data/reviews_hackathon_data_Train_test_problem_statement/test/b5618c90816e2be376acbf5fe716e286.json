I contacted them once more to check what else could I do to find the order, and they didn't reply anymore.\nI understand it wasn't the company's fault, and perhaps the packages got lost in the mail, but it was too much for me that 2 orders got lost accidentally.\nI might consider using them in the future but only if they add a different shipping method (FedEx, DHL, etc...) that would allow tracking the orders online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T23:50:12.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

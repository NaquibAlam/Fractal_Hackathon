Although I would like to see better results of my hair removal, my hair is thinning in the areas I want to remove. I understand that I still have a few more sessions left and I am hopeful that the hair will be removed fully. At first I was put off by having a new person every time, but I love that it makes my service fast and I got over being shy in front of everyone, because they make you feel very comfortable. I would recommend LaserAway to my family and friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:14:27.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

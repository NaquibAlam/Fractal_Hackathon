I had to wait at the desk for 45min before I was served and then it took an hour as they bumbled around trying to bring the car I had ordered, when I finally got to the car one of the seats was off its runners, I had to call redspot employees to try and fix it, 2 separate people tried to fix it and failed. At that point they said they would call in another car. Frightened by the prospect of having myself and the 5 people traveling with me having to wait another hour, I proceeded to fix it myself. Needless to say I would be reluctant to use Redspot again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:02:57.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

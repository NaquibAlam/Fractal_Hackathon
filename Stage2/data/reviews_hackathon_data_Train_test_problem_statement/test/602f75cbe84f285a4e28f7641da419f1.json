He contacted the previous agent so I didn’t have too, gathered all the relevant documents and information needed and had everything sorted within a week.\nOne thing that stood out to me was how frequently Frank followed up, not only throughout the take-over process but also with general inspections, rental payments, tenant needs etc. I never have to worry when things will be done as Frank is always proactive with keeping me informed. He is very patient, even when I ask him a multitude of questions and delivers on client expectations.\nI found the change over experience an easy simple and seamless one and would highly recommend Frank to people who need a Rental Property Manager!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T10:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T18:45:51.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

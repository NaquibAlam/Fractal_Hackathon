I purchased an expensive Bugaboo stroller online for a friend living in Ireland, I am in the US. I emailed with an update to the delivery address and customer service responded that the product was not in stock and it would be up to 6 weeks before it would be in. Why was I not notified before they processed my payment? That would be too late so I asked for a refund which took a couple of days to process. Because of this and the change in exchange rate, I was not given the full amount back I paid in US dollars so I lost money and Tony Kealys has not offered any money back, credit or help, they told me to work it out with my bank. A company should have updated software that does not allow a purchase to go through when items are out of stock, and if it does the company should be responsible for covering the loss of $ due to exchange rate because they processed and took money for a product they did not have. Ridiculous that I lost money and have had to deal with this and received no product, do not shop here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:49:54.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

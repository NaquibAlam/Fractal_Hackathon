The first time everything was fine although the free gift left a lot to be desired... small bottle of lubricant.\nHowever, the second time I used them has been a complete disgrace. I ordered two items, one of them was a Jessica Rabbit Slim. When it arrived, we opened the box and we completely stunned to find that the rabbit was completely covered in an oily substance. Thinking this might be some kind of packaging substance to protect and sterilise the product during postal, we decided to put batteries into it. When we opened the battery compartment, we saw that there was a lot of oil inside. When we put brand new batteries in, the product never worked.\nI contacted the company by telephone and spoke to Richard and when I told him what we found, I advised him that it was like someone else had used this product and sent it back and then it was shipped out to use. I did not say that was what actually happened, I simply said to Richard that it was reasonable for us to think that. He got very aggressive on the phone and threatened legal action and accusing me of all sorts. He never once apologised or gave me any explanation as to what might have caused the product to be covered in oil. He continued to be aggressive on the phone and repeating his legal threats.\nThis was not the way I was expecting this simple issue to be dealt with. All he had to do was apologise and say he would look into the issue and get back to me. He didn’t do that, he was aggressive and totally over looked the fact that his company sent a sex toy out to a customer that was covered in oil and didn’t work.\nAnother issue I have is that although the products are sent out in a courier plastic packaging, the company’s initials, address and company number are clearly displayed on the package. I think most people ordering sex toys online do so because they don’t want anyone seeing or knowing what they are buying, at least that’s our reason. The fact that the company details are printed on the front of the packaging is not exactly discreet. However, that is just a small issue but the main issue is the condition a product was sent out to us and the unprofessional and aggressive way my complaint was handled.\nI am still trying to get this issue resolved almost a month later but I have to say that I would never buy anything from this company again and I would NOT recommend them to anyone.\nThey have just sent me an email saying they have applied a credit to my account, even though I have already advised them I wanted a refund and they had already said they would give me a full refund. Oh, and not one single word of apology in the email they just sent to me.\nI would be very interested to know what other people might think if they bought a rabbit type sex toy online and when they got it in the post and found that it was covered in oil and didn’t work, what would you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:46:15.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

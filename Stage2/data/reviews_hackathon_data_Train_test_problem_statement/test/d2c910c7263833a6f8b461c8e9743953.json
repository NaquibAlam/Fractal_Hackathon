I paid in full when I rented the car from you for the 10 days. When I collected the car in El Salvador Airport from Budget Rent a Car on the 24th February 2017 early morning, they charged an additional $900 as a security deposit. I was not aware of this amount but it was ok. Mr. Manuel at the Counter said he will return this money back to my credit card in 2-3 days after I return the car. I return the car unscratched, washed and cleaned on the 5th or March Morning at 10.30am with full tank of gas. When I returned the car, they inspected and took over the car giving me the voucher. Today is the 28th Tuesday (23 days after I returned the car) and I have still not received my money. I have sent few messages to the phone numbers they had given me and also to Mr. Manuel but I have not got a reply yet. If I don't receive this money back, it' going to be very damaging to Budget Rent a car. I have rented all my cars from Budget rent a car. I will write my experience to all the news sites and also to Budget.

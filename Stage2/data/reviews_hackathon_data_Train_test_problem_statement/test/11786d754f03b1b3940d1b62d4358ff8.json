When the blind arrived the slats had 18mm gap at the bottom and were really poor quality , I called and and was treated as if I was stupid and it was my fault before I had even explained properly, I was then told to email pics of the blinds on the floor , hung up and attached to the rail . Every time my tape measure showed they were short but the arrogant staff continued to refuse to admit anything was wrong with the blinds after fifteen emails and having the phone put down on myself I was sent a doctored picture taken at an angle in bad light declaring that the blind head rail was 50mm after I had been made to send pic after pic showing the rail was actually 43mm . They are still refusing to take any responsibility whatsoever and I have now opened a complaint with trading standards.\nPlease don't make my mistake and deal with these people ever .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:36:48.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

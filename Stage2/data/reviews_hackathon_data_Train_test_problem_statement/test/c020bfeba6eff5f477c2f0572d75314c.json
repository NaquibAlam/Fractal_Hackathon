It fits all of my books with room for more. The only drawback I have found is that there is no strap or band of any type to hold the folder shut and with books in there like that they want to slide out. Not sure if just individual sheets would do that or not but would be good to have a strap. I'm searching for a big rubberband. This would not be an issue if the folder were not being transported like if used in a band or orchestra setting. So no real complaints on the product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T20:07:17.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

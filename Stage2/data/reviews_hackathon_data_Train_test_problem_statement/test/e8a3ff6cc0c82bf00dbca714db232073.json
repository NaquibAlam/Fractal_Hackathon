The set up was straight forward. The major problem has been both A4 mattresses are collapsing after less than 4 week use. Both sides of the split bed are collapsing in an area about 18 inch diameter where the \"butt\" weight is concentrated. One on the mattresses is also settling side to side so one side is nearly 1/2 inch lower than the other. I have photos if it would help review. I am deciding if it is worth the cost to send back or replace mattresses locally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:03:55.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

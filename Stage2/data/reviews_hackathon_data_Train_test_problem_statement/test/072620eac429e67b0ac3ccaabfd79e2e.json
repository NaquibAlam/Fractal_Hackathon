We took it back to the store to upgrade ,as we could not get our money back. The sales man said we can upgrade to a more expensive soft plush mattress. We paid more money. Before leaving the store I looked at the new mattess which was still in the plastic to make sure no holes and the stitching was good. When we got it home we took it out of the plastic set it up and again it was hard, not soft not plush. The product in the store is NOT what we brought home. Very dissapointed. We will never buy from this store again nor recommend this store to anyone....UPDATE...we were told the manager of the Lawton Home Zone store would contact us that day...they never did...we want our money back at this point, we want to speak to the regional manager, Alli, that responded to our complaint. The Lawton store has all my information to contact me asap.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:29:37.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

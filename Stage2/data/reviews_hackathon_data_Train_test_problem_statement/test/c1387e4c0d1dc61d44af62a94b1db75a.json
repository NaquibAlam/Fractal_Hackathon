When I first bought the policy I didn't realise I had only bought 8000km so when I contacted boxymo about 3 weeks into my policy to change my mileage plan I was told it was too late so I ended up spending twice the original amount as I had to keep topping up on mileage all year..Even though it was my own fault for not reading the info on the website correctly I still thought it was bad form to not allow me to change the milleage plan at an early stage so I could have saved money. I really felt I got ripped off big time.\nAnother reason I was really disappointed with boxyMo was the lack of communication..it was so frustrating when I had a problem and I couldn't pick up the phone and speak to someone, I had to send a message online and sometimes wait up to 3 days before someone called me back and the fact that boxyMo would only make one attempt to call back was really frustrating, if I missed the call I had to send another message online and wait again for the call. This was a really frustrating and bad service.\nFinally another big issue was this. I wanted to buy a new car and swap over my box and I was told I would have to pay for this service so again boxyMo just wanted to take more money of me. Overall I just felt BoxyMo were out to get as much money as possible of me and in return offered me a very poor customer service experience. I was relieved at the end of my policy so I could move onto a better insurance company with an excellent breakdown service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:12:05.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Renault needed to kep my car over the weekend as they were waiting on a part. They provided me with a car and routinely rang AIG who appear as Insurers on my insurance disc. Shortly after that my husband gets a call from its for women to listen to a lecture from the its for women rep that the dealer cannot transfer insurance and my husband or I would need to go online to do this. This was at 5pm on a Friday evening. Thankfully I was not the person waiting at the garage and thankfully our four kids were not with my husband. I transfered the insurance that evening online I was charged 20euro eventhough I did the work and not the company. I have 25 years of claim and penalty point free driving and this is the first time my garage have not been able to transfer my insurance to a garage car with a quick phonecall that is the custom in the Rep of Ireland. Furthermore I have never been charged before by an Insurance company for arranging temporary transfer of cover. I wont be renewing, its for women is not in fact for me I am a full time working Mum of four and could not be botheted with this companys lecturing to me on being an online company and horrendous lack of focus on customer care. Interestingly the company cannot answer your phone queries but will ring you back, however choose the line they have for dealerships and they answer immediately try it I did !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:41:13.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

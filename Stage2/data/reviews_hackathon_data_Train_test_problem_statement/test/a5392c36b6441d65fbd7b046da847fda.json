This company claim to be \"cheaper\" but its a Scam. I was booking online but I didn't have the option for wheelchair access when flying so I called and waited 25 minutes to speak with someone, it was very difficult to understand the man as I tried to give him my almost booked online flight details. He advised me that he would have to book for me since there was no wheelchair option for me to choose, he explained that we could have called after booking for the option... Once he finished with the exact flight information he told me the price went up $150.00 per person, so I decided not to book as he explained the prices fluctuate every 5 hours. I went back online to check the price.. It did go up as he said, so I switched the flight dates and found the same price I wanted flying a few days later. Once I filled out all my flight information and processed my payment, It notified me once again that the price increased by $100 per person... so much for every 5 hours. I'm not sure if this is a norm with this site and if so you are cheating many people. As a frequent traveller I've never had to deal with a scam such as this.\nTotal waste of time\nYour unhappy customer", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T23:05:34.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I thought my son had accidently purchased some apps so I called customer service and not only was it super quick, but the guy was amazingly nice and so helpful. He got a tech on the other line and had them look everything up and come to find out it was my sons dad that purchased iCloud storage lol and I didn't know about it. So Shawn was super helpful about the whole thing and even sent me an email with info and links if I do need help again with that or anything else. Thanks Apple I'm happy to say that I actually am a fan now! The iPhone 5s my son has is very sturdy also and it works great for him so great service AND products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T15:19:32.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

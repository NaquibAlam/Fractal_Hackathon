I ordered 2 boxes of super plus. 5th tampon today. Apparently your super plus is not comparable with Tampax in the amount of liquid it can hold and how frequently i need to change it. Bled on my jeans and my shorts. (i'm 42 years old. this is not my first rodeo.) 5 out of 5 for the applicator not working AT ALL. it doesn't do anything but push the tampon out a little bit, then get stuck. my fingers aren't long enough to reach through the hole to push it out. so 5 times today i've had to pull a bloody tampon and applicator out, try not to get it all over my work outfit, pull it out of the worthless applicator, put it in myself & wash all this mess off (thank god i went in the wheelchair stall!). what a terrific day guys! i'm so glad i didn't tell anyone to buy this fiasco. i will tell them *not* to. subscription cancelled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:20:26.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

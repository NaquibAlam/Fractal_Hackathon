My daughter hit her head and required medical attention, preventing us from taking the trip. We had paid 3200 EUR for the flight. The trip insurer asked for a more detailed invoice from opodo than what had been provided to us when we purchased the ticket. They wanted a \"break down\" of the ticket price in terms of taxes. The invoice provided by opodo listed 2/3 of the ticket price as \"airport tax\" and the insurance company claimed that they were not responsible for refunding \"airport tax\", even though this made up most of the ticket price. They also refused to refund on the basis of \"serious injury\" even though we provided medical documentation of my daughter's injury. They insisted that we were only eligible for refund on the basis of \"unavoidable problem\". This left us with a refund offer of 800 EUR on a 3200 EUR ticket with 145 EUR of trip insurance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:07:35.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

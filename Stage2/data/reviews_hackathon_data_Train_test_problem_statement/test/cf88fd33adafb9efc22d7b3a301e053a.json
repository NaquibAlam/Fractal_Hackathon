Do be aware of the \"fuel service charge\" which can be up to Euro30, but at least it's explained in the small print. (Some other companies don't explain or forewarn you)\nSometimes queues are a bit slow moving, but it's worth the wait if you don't want to pay an \"express\" premium.\nGoldcar staff are generally friendly, but if you get a grumpy one it might be because they're at the end of a shift of dealing with difficult or dumb customers.\nIn common with all car hire companies, the full insurance protection is outrageously expensive. Buy your own car hire excess insurance policy on line in advance, even if only for 1 trip, but beware they (Goldcar) will take a big credit card deposit (Euro 1100 or more) and are sometimes a bit slow to annul it. (Their service standard is 7 to 10 days). This might cause you a problem if your credit card is near its max. Also allow extra time to check the car over at both start and finish as sometimes they're a bit dented/ scratched, and if you're not using their insurance you need their sign off that the damage is not down to you. It's still worth it though, as their full insurance protection can triple the cost of car hire. I've probably used Goldcar Alicante 30 times or more. I've tried others but not satisfied with them - usually their extras make them more expensive than Goldcar, and with no better/ sometimes worse service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T22:42:38.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

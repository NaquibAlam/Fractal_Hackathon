First I'm hearing of this!! Called the customer service and they said they will sort it out. I had booked the ticket, onward connections and hotels in January so i was pretty anxious and wanted the problem to be resolved urgently. Over 2 weeks on and calling the call centre every other day (did not receive one phone call from lastminute), we are still missing a seat for the infant and we have just over a week to go until departure. SHOCKING CUSTOMER SERVICE!! WONT USE LASTMINUTE AGAIN!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:12:01.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

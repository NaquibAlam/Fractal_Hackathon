I am looking to purchase a caravan in France , I chose one with caravans in the sun , paid a deposit , then realised the caravan would actually be a bit tight for my family of 6. Nothing was too much bother for Mel, James or Sue ( and Bill in France on the site) they refunded my deposit no problem and continue to help me find our holiday caravan . Extremely rare to find such an honest company that actually care whether you are happy or not ! Would highly recommend , and we will definitely buy with them ... 100% trustworthy\nRachel (Cornwall)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T23:34:09.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

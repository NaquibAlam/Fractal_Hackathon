He duly arrived as scheduled, only to discover that he'd been issued with a standard Pirelli instead of the run-flat tyre which had been ordered.\nAs it was nearly the end of the day I was advised that the correct tyre would be ordered and fitting rearranged for the following day (Thursday). I called the Event Tyres office the following morning to find out when fitter would arrive.\nI was told it was being coordinated by their 'Southern Office' and that someone would call me to give me an update. Suffice to say no one did, so I chased the Central Office again later in the day and was told the tyre would be fitted on the following day, (Friday).\nBy mid afternoon on Friday, I'd heard nothing from Event Tyres, so I rang again to ask about a likely fitting time. It was only then that I was told there was a stock issue with the particular tyre needed for our car.\nConsequently, they wouldn't be able to locate and fit the tyre that day and instead it would be Monday of the following week before the tyre could be obtained by their supplier and then fitted to the car.\nThis did eventually happen and again, the fitter was excellent - he kept me informed of his schedule throughout the day, arrived on time and completed the job in just a few minutes.\nMy issue on this occasion is two-fold. Firstly there seemed to be an appalling lack of communication & coordination between Event Tyres' central & southern offices.\nSecondly there seemed to be an unwillingness or inability by anyone at the central office to take responsibility for the problem, find a sensible solution and communicate clearly with the customer.\nInstead they simply palmed off the problem to the Southern Office who never called me throughout the whole debacle and they seemed constantly surprised when I kept having to chase them for some kind of an update.\nI was told they have a \"new system\" in place, but I'd suggest it either needs some serious attention, or they should revert back to the old system because as things stand, the communication & coordination internally and with the customer is poor to say the least.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:44:48.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

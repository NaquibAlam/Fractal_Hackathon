But now I can tell you I am having the same problems with receiving their delivery again. My orders from BC seem to always be delayed. This time, I tracked my order, it took 7 days to arrive in Sacramento, which is 45 miles from my home. My order arrived in Sac on a Friday morning. Yet it never made it to my house on Friday, nor on Saturday, and by Monday, Fed Ex had removed the estimated delivery date (which had been on Saturday), and had no estimated delivery date at all. So I am in limbo, $$$ out of my pocket with no products. Find a better company that can provide decent shipping times:(", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:50:16.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

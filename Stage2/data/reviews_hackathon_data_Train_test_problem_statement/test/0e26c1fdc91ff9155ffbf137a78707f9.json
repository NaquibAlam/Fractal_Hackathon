I managed to order 4 new tyres in quick fashion, did a credit application, checked out and awaited further instructions.\nI was contacted on Monday morning early (08:09) and my appointment was confirmed. I was also told that the selection that I made had only 3 tyres available. I was offered another solution which cost a little extra at no additional charge.\nTuesday morning arrived and I received an email stating that I would have my fitting between 11:54 and 12:54. I received a call at 11:45 from Mark (my entrusted installer) saying that he was 15min out. Low and behold, at exactly 12:00 Mark arrived and set upon his task of my tyre replacement.\nLittle more than an hour later Mark was done with the job at hand.\nI am very pleased with the service and professionalism in which TOTD operate.\nI will definitely use them again!!!\nA very happy client!!\nPs. Did I mention how sexy my car looks with her new shoes? ;)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:06:09.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

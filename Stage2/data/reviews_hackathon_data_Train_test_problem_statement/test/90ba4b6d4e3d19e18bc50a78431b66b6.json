I called their customer services… the only answer was a recorded message \"all representatives are busy, please wait. Waited for about 10 minutes, the recording came back asking to leave phone number and they will me back. Keyed my number and to confirmed pressed 1 and at that time the system said \"feature not available at this time, goodbye\" Called back but this time decided to select \"order\" I got an immediate live response to take my order. When I attempted to explain why I was calling they switched me back to customer services and the same response I explained above happened again. Send a text message, no response. Send an email and I received a reply they will review the email within 5 days. Still no flowers delivered. To all this when I used the purchase order number to track it, the response “This order scheduled to be delivered today / not further update has been posted.” The only thing that would satisfy me will be the “REFUND”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:48:39.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

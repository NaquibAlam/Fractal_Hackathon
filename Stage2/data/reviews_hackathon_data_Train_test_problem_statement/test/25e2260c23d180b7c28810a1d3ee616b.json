Yet upon my arrival at the Goldcar desk in Bologna, the vendor advised - while showing a leaflet and a breakdown detail - that the full insurance sold by their Spanish partner wasn't enough to cover 100 % of contingencies. He the offered a further insurance policy worth €95,04 and suggested to get in touch with the broker DoYouItaly to raise a claim which I did before the end of that day. The broker answered in real time, they rejected the refund I requested and explained they were aware of the \"extra business\" made by Goldcar through the insurance charges.\nNeedless to say , Goldcar did not refund the double insurance as I asked them to do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:44:16.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The website said it was in stock. After I ordered they called to try to \"confirm the shipping address\" and then promptly tried to sell me an extended warranty and additional accessories, which I refused.\nAfter getting no shipment confirmation I called them today and talked to Jeff who told me that the camera was backordered for 1-2 weeks. When I asked why they hadn't bothered to let me know during the earlier phone call (or subsequently) he became rude and asked me whether I wanted to cancel my order but offered no apology whatsoever.\nNow I'm hoping that I can order the camera from a more professional retailer in time for the trip I wanted the camera for.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:18:35.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

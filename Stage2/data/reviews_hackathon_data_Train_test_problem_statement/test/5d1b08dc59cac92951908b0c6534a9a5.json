STAY CLEAR OF THIS CPMAPNY & IT'S CHEAP PRODUCTS!!\nI ordered a dozen mugs with pictures to be added to them. When the mugs arrived, half of them were damaged in shipment & production issues (folded picture edges and scratches).\nThey replaced them with another order that showed up damaged!\nThe 3rd time around and as well a new (dozen order) they again showed up with the same issues. They sent a 4th replacement order & the same thing happened!!! C'mon, out of all 39 that were sent (replacements and all.. there were only 21 useable mugs!!)\nUNBELIEVABLE!!! So, all in all... after spending almost $600.00 on this product, I have 21 useable mugs and a $96.00 refund and as well, a garbage full of damaged and production issue mugs.\nNOT GOOD, IF ONE WANTS TO STAY IN BUSINESS!!!\nPLEASE, STAY CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:41:42.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

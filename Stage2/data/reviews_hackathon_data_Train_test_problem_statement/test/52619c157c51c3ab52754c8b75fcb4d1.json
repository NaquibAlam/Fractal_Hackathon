I purchased a cake server set a month ago and returned to have it engraved. The sales person was very pushy and insisted that I put certain things on the engraving to find out that the cost was going to be outrageous and way more than I was willing to pay. This seemed to annoy her when I said NO. I wanted Quote: s for different engraving. Her comment to me was, \"weddings are expensive.\" Then she had the gull to Quote: me a price for some scrolling that I even confirmed before I left it with them. Then she was rushing me to pay. When I picked it up, she had priced it double what she had told me!! She seemed to be gone when I came back to pick it up and the other sales person was no help and could of cared less! The whole experience has made me realize that I will never return there to purchase or have any engraving done. My motto is word of mouth and if this company thinks this is the way to treat their paying customers, then I will go elsewhere!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T23:11:32.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

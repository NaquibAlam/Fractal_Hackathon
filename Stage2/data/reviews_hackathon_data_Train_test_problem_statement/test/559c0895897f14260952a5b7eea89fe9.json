While an expensive product, the alternative was a drone. Cost-wise they came out about the same, but the photomast is low-tech and allows use of our standard camera. We are very happy about our choice - this is a very high quality product. The relatively low weight means it is portable enough to be carried strapped onto a rucksack. A bit heavier than randonee skis. Our main use will be taking pictures of anchorages for a harbour guide, and hopefully some great summit/cairn photos while \"sail & skiing\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T16:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:16:34.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

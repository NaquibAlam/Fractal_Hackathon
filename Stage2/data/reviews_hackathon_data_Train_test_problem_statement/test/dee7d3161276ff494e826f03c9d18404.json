I would highly recommend you do not buy from this company , its verging on fraudulent and trying to get your money back from china or wherever they are seems impossible. in my one and only experience the product was also of very poor quality. if anyone is reading from lightinthebox and feels the urge to end this sorry story my ticket number is . 14596187 and my order number is 1611290720435603. in the meantime if you think I'm just going to give up and go away ..think on", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:48:12.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

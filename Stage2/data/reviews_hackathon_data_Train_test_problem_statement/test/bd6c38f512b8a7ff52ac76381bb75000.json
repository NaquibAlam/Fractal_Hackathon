So I contacted Last minute.com who said they didn't know if it was cancelled and would have to check, 5 phone calls later the last at 2am with multiple employees telling me I was in the UK, when I was actually in Beijing I had to just book another flight myself to ensure I actually got a return flight. Throughout this whole experience the staff of last minute.com were completely useless and I now cannot get an answer to any emails regarding a refund for the cancelled flight. I will never use Last minute.com, Bravofly or any other affiliated company again. By far the most clueless, unprofessional and out of date company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.

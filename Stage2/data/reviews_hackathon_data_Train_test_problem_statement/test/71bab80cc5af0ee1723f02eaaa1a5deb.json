But if you drive normal routes forget about it. They significantly restrict you on how far you can travel, and charge very high rates if you exceed it. And you cannot contact them by telephone which is very frustrating. They provide an unreliable call back service, that if they do call you back on (if..) it'll be hours later. And if you attempt to make the slightest change or alteration to the policy, forget about it. It's not possible or it costs you a fortune! They are the Ryanair of car insurance!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:13:42.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

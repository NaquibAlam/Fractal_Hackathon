How do i get in contact with this company. Item is still in the original package and im at a loss with what to do. I feel tricked/ robbed. Very unhappy customer.... You take a chance ordering from this company . Order may come, it may not. Items may fit they probably won't. Americans are not 90lbs. That's the weight I would have to be to fit into this jumper. There is no return/ exchange section on their site. If you Google it, all it does is bring you to the site. Horrible company, if they can even call themselves a company.

My original flight was changed without anyone contacting me from Flighthub or the airline which would have made it impossible for me to catch my connecting flight (also booked through Flighthub with the same airline). I only noticed because I went to book another flight and saw the mix up. Flighthub told me this was the airline's mistake. Fine.\nThe day before I was to leave, I went to check-in on my flight and could not do so. The airline said that when I rebooked my flight, the travel agency never reissued my ticket so I would have to call Flighthub and get them to reissue the ticket and then I could check-in.\nWhen I called Flighthub the customer service rep told me just to go and check-in at the airport 3 hours before my flight. When I insisted that the problem be figured out now, she disappeared from the phone line without saying anything, then after a long wait, she comes back and says she can get me a flight on a different day with no explanation as to why I could no longer be on the original flight. After pushing this further and having her disappear on me a couple more times I told her I wanted a refund and I would book the flight myself. She then tells me the refund will be for $520. When I asked where that amount came from, she disappeared again and then came back and said \"ok I'm ready to issue the refund for $520\", not answering my question. I pushed further and asked to speak to a manager but was told she was the only one there. Finally she explained that the seat assignment fee and cancellation insurance is non-refundable. This is fine but it took me asking several times to get an answer. It's been over a week and I still don't have the refund in my account.\nI then went on and booked myself the exact same flight to Hawaii that I was supposed to be on except with a 2 hour layover in San Fran instead of a 5.5 hour one.\nI am never booking through Flighthub again. I have used them in the past and things have been fine but clearly their customer service is lacking.\nUpdate: called because it has been almost two weeks with no refund and was told it would take 6-8 WEEKS to process. When I asked for something in writing, like an email to confirm the refund was coming, they refused. DON'T BUY THROUGH FLIGHTHUB!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:19:37.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

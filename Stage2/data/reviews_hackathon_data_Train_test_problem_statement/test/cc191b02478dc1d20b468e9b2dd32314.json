After receiving a Quote: , my wife and I decided to switch over to California Casualty, even at higher rates, due to the claim that they would take special care of teachers. Specifically, they claimed that in the event of vandalism of a personal vehicle while on campus, they would take care of the situation with no deductible. However, when my car was vandalized and my phone stolen out of the car during school hours, they demanded a $500 deductible in order for me to file my claim. I felt cheated and decided to take my business elsewhere. Their customer service is terrible to say the least and their promises are said without any integrity. Go elsewhere if you want an honest company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:24:17.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

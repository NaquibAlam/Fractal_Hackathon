When I said that I was going to go to another store to look at alternate selections no one tried to convince me to purchase right away. I did end up coming back in the same afternoon for the bedroom furniture that I was originally looking for and decided to add a living room set as well.\nShawn, my sales associate, seemed to be new to this store. He knew the products but had problems with the computer system. Jeremy, his manager, was super helpful and everyone was very friendly.\nI have not received my furniture yet (I requested a later delivery date due to a move) so I can't review the actual products but there were many choices, seemingly something for every style and budget.\nI went in based on a recommendation from a friend who purchased furniture the previous weekend and will recommend this place to other friends in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:25:27.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

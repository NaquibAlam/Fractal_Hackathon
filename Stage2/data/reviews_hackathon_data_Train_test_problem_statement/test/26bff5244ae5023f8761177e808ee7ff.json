The site said the arrival of the beams would be between March 23rd and March 28th. I went online to track today (March 28th) and they have not even been shipped. When I called and spoke to the rep she said due to the volume the order would be delayed. I asked for an ETA or if they could be expedited and she said no, she just went on and on about how popular the beams were and that's why they were late. That's great, but of no use to me. She was unable to answer my question about when the beams would arrive. Absolutely terrible practices-their process of estimating appropriate time arrivals is unacceptable (product needs to be shipped when you advertise) and even worse customer service to add insult to injury. I ordered from this website specifically due to their turnaround. If I had known it wasn't accurate whatsoever, I would have ordered elsewhere, from the more well known online beam source and would have had a more painless experience I'm sure.

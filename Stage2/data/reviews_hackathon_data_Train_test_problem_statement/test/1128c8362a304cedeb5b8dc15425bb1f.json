They have Gone Above and Beyond to make certain all of my needs have been met as a customer. The products are good quality and are represented well by product deceptions. As I have said before, if you the individual make an error the wrong keyboard, the company goes out of there way to meet your needs. The Co-Founder amd Vice President of the company, Pavel Simirnov became invested in my small purchase. Instead of me sending back the entire product, he sent a keyboard that would adapt to the Apple IPad case cover that worked perfect for my Surface Pro at his cost!!\nIt is clear quality products and quality employees are imperative to Tablet2Cases throughout the company--Customer Service Associate, Anna Beccera to Customer Advocate, Curt and Pavel Simirnov, VP of the Tablet2Case of Company. I would highly recommend this company on product quality, speed of shipping, and customer service communication and skills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T20:03:53.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

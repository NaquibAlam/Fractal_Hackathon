Company claimed, wrongly, that I had damaged the front bumper.\nWe had seen some damage to it on hiring, refused the car. Then the guy in Alicante took a photo, said it was now on record, and was all clear, so off we went.\nReturned car without any scratches (it was parked most of the week). 3 weeks and I heard nothing but today saw that the money was removed from my account without my knowledge, agreement or even notification\nYou seem to be Cowboys? I will fight this.\nPaul Sweeney Dublin", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T01:03:41.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I buy rarely. It also doesn't allow us to quickly scan bundles. If I want to know how many are coop games or online multiplayer, has achievements, cards, or anything, I have to click on every individual game. It should be listed under title without needing a single left click. Then I can quickly scan and decide if it's a bundle I might use or a bundle that I wasted a dollar on and will never use. Because the bundles are so large, I am often demotivated to scan every individual game, so I pass instead.\nAs for the actual service though, it works how it's intended and can be trusted even with my card information stored. It emailed me to make this review like it will help them gain sales. It wont. What will is cleaning up their garbage cluttering their sales.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:10:36.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

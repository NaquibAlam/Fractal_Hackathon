Every image in the product listing shows the receiver and the description says \"all you need is a transmitter and goggles\". I sent the product images from tomtop.com to their support email and stepped into a nightmare.\nI've now been in contact with TOMTOP support for a month. They refuse to send the missing part, rotating between excuses like \"the receiver is your cell phone\" (no...a cell phone is way too big for a quadcopter to carry), \"we aren't going to send you a remote controller\" (I already have one. It goes with the receiver you neglected to send.), and insults to my intelligence. The email chain shows that it takes a minimum of 4 days after sending a message to get any response at all. They're clearly not going to send the part I've already paid for.\nThe quadcopter itself is a piece of crap. The camera came pre-scratched (for my convenience, I guess?) and one of the motors had a bad bearing. I bought a far better camera for $25.\nI still continue my battle with TOMTOP, but won't be sending any more money to them in exchange for garbage products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T13:00:12.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

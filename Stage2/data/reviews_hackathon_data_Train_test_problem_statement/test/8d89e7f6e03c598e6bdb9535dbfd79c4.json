So I thought ah ok its not that bad.\n- After 10 month I started having mayor problems with my phone and actually send it back even though they again told me they would make me pay for it.\n- After 2 1/2 month and hours with the customer-service I got my cellphone send back to me had to pay the extra charge, plus shipment. All of that because they don't consider the error on my phone not a major problem for using it. (Which all local electricstores told me it was)\nConclusion:\nEven if the prices are lower then anywhere else and you think you will never have to deal with the customer-service, you should really trust me it is never worth buying there.\nIn there own words:\nPlease note that all our products are imported goods and will not come with manufacturer's warranty but instead we will cover the warranty through our own company.

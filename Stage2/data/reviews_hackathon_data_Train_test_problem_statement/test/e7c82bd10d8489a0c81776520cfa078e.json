I spoke to the customer service agent who was very pleasant and verified my address was correct, she is the only reason I gave 2 stars. She was also confused as to why they could not find my address (I have had deliveries from purolator multiple times before). She scheduled the delivery for the next day but again it did not get delivered because of some ridiculous reason that they missed this delivery even though it had been out for delivery since 7am in the morning.

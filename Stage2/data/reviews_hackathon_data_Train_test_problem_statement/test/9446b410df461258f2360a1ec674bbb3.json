This was my second pair I ordered on line. A week before I had ordered a pair of Burberrys from a competitor. But then using this website I 'just had to have' a pair of Oakley Carbon Plates, so I ordered those.\nMy only complaint with FramesDirect is their shipping. I ordered on 12/21/16, and they were shipped on 12/30 but didn't get here until 1/13/17!\nMeanwhile, the competitor's order to delivery was less than two weeks and they used 2 or 3 day air. I would think when spending multi-hundreds of dollars on glasses, and with such a small shipping package, FramesDirect would include 2 or 3 day air - free.\nBesides that issue, my glasses and lenses are perfect!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:06:11.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

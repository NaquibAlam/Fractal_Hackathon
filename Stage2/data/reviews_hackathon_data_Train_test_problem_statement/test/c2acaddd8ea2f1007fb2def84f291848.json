Please be advised if choosing to have a full service by Servicingstop.co.uk you will find is not a normal full service the Price Quote: d Will be escalated by so-called additional work and parts normally included in a full service. No service schedule received, so no prof of the work carried out, ther wasn't any water in the window washer after service? My price Quote: d was £118 and I ended up paying £356.22 if paying with a credit card there will be another 2.50% added. Also beware when paying there will also be another £44 added to the invoice, this will need to be un-ticked, added towards next years service. When I spoke to the garage owners I was told they were only paid £182 by Servicingstop.co.uk for the work.That's about 49% extra commission to Servicingstop.co.uk. I feel very angry and will not consider a car service by this company ever again. Please beware and go elsewhere.\nServicing stop have asked to have my negative review removed is this normal practice to keep there ratings high?\nUpdate--- I have now reported this to Citizens Advice consumer service. Also Trading Standards of the trader's activities. Hopefully will help to stop this kind of practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:25:38.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

He checks the schedule every Monday, been doing it for 10 years new manager and all of a sudden he is terminated because he missed 2 shifts So we go in the find out what happened and she refuses to let me in the room with them, tells him we post the schedule Friday sorry too bad.... He literally got an award for perfect attendance last year and if a 70 something year old man doesn't show up for a shift a humman would call to see if he was ok! What is wrong with this world!!!They didn't have him on for almost a month after the holidays and then they put him on the schedule for 2 days in a row, with 2 days notice and dont even call when he doesn't show and don't bother tell him that he was terminated until he calls to see when they were going to have him back on the schedule! Absolutely NOT ok! Unacceptable!!!! 10 years of loyal service without even a courtesy call!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:34:17.291+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Out of the several companies available, I chose this one. Now here I am over two weeks later and it appears my order was lost and as there doesn't seem to be a way to track my order, I'm now out over $150. I will definitely hesitate to use an online company such as this one. Even if retail stores and places like Moneytree pay less, at least I won't have to worry about not getting paid. Seems like there should be some sort of guarantee or policy regarding cases like this...

But lo, my focus has changed, and I had not done any of that kind of work for at least a few years. However, I recently needed some frames and immediately went to American Frame and was entirely impressed with the on-line interactive ordering process and delivery. I have not yet opened the package, but I trust the materials are as good as ever. I would hope, though, that American Frame was not so often out of stock for standard walnut frames. :(", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:57:06.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I sent an e-mail and they quickly corrected the shipping adress. But since the billing stayed incorrect, their security software kicked it back. I was upset because I needed it by a certain day and was positive that was no longer possible. They offered to upgrade my shipping so that it would arrive when I needed it. My second order came through very quickly and was everything I expected and more. The extras are very high quality, their customer service is top notch, and everything came as promised. It is worth noting that they are closed weekends so don't expect any movement the weekends. Will definitely use them again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T21:22:14.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

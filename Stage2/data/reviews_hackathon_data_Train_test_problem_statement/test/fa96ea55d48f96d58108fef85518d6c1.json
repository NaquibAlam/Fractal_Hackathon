I submitted the repair request to have the broken glass/screen repaired. I received an email confirming my payment and scheduled pickup time by 1pm on Sunday. Later that afternoon I received a call stating the screen repair would be an additional $50 because I mistakenly selected iPhone 6 not iPhone 6s. I approved the repairs over the phone. Sunday 1pm came and went the phone still was not fixed, in fact the phone was not completed and ready for pickup until after 1pm on Monday. When I turned on the phone the fingerprint login no longer worked. So we called the customer service department manager, she called back and informed me that the phone was damaged internally and the cable that controls the fingerprint was damaged and could not be repaired. This was Not explained at all during the repair service and Not mentioned until I called to complain! I feel like Foxpaw was intentionally deceptive so they would not lose the sale. The customer service manager did finally agree to refund the additional $50 charge.\nUnhappy Customer,\nOrder number 0081748", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:20:25.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Delivery date passed by and I asked about the status, I was asked at least 20 times if I want a blue one which was available. I wanted a black one and waited and waited and asked and waited. Finally my black phone arrived and I had to pay 60+Euros at the door for customstax. OK I was happy that the phone was finally here. I had paied the \"customs insurance\" that coolicool offered for 40 Euro and wrote the support that I woluld like to claim the customstax. The support offered me 40 Euros plus a 15 Euro cupon. What kind of math is that? To make a long story short, after about 20 mails with the support which lead to nothing I opened a ticket with paypal and finally got my customstax back.\nThe product I received (Elephone R9) makes me really happy therefor 5 star for the product but the aftermath was for the bin, therfor 1 star.\nI would buy again but only from the european outlet an products that are deliverable.\nAnd by the way, where is the button to switch to english? Coolicool asks me for my opinion and routes me to a chinese site, another example of bad service, sorry but way to go coolicool. . . .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:11:06.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

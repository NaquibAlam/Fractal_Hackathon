The second package has been held by DHL express office in China with risk of being confiscated. Attempts to resolve have lead to over 50 emails over the past 3-4 weeks, multiple documentation with risk of breach of confidential documentation, with no confirmed information on extra costs to store and duty fees (for a personal second hand items - not commercial). So far it can be at least twice as much as the cost of sending and value of items. This is because the original representative at pack and send did not correctly complete description of items or provide disclosure/declaration and too vague that ended up being flagged to China leading to a delay until correct/detailed/additional information is provided (which I am having to spend time, more money and drama in doing while in China). Please note that China is a communist country that speak very limited English.

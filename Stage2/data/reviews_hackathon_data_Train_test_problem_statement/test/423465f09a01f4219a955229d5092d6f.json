Awful company. Don't risk it!\n\"I will never recommend this terrible service to anyone and they should not be able to profit off such a terrible and dangerous platform. My dog was attacked by another dog while at one of their verified sitters and since the vet bill wasn't over $500 dollars they won't cover anything. So much for the \"insurance\" they say they provide. My dog will now live with scars from being attacked and I just want my $445 dollars back from the vet bill and a refund for the dog boarding service that wasn't performed. Rover shouldn't allow a dog sitter to host more than one dog due to this risk.\nNot that any of this is pertinent to the claim but my dog is a 28lb well trained French bulldog who wouldn't hurt a fly. He doesn't even bark at other dogs. The fact that my dog was allowed to be bit not only once but 5 times shows negligence and irresponsibility by the dog sitter as well as a lack of responsibility on Rover.com for not wanting to cover the vet bill and the cost of the boarding.\nMay this be a warning to anyone who is considering using this dangerous and unprofessional service.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:32:26.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

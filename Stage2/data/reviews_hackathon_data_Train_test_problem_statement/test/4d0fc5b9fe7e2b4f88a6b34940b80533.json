I purchased in September, i didn't received in fall so I expected them in the spring but with no communication I was not sure. Then without notice the plants arrived in the middle of winter! I wrote and asked what to do and why. Someone said just plant them, you are in California and California doesn't have winters. But it had been raining for days and I couldn't get them planted for a week. After I planted the banana plant all the leaves turned brown and wilted I sent a picture and was told the plant is not dead and will be fine. I paid for a 3 foot tall plant and if it lives will be about one foot.\nThen after i wrote a negative review i got an email with instructions on how to return a dead plant.

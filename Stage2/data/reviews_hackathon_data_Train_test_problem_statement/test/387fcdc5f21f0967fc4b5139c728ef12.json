I have worked in snowsports retail as a clothing manager for many years and know the brands intimately.. and as such have tried and previously sold many of the products I have purchased at great discount from bt... everything is as described and fitted perfectly.. but I have the knowledge and the brand experience, knowing the quality of the product and the fit of each item well in advance puts me at an advantage when purchasing items.. I have managed to mass a phenomenal wardrobe and kit collection at ridiculously cheap prices... a fraction of the retail price often cheaper than the wholesale price...\nbut... but but.... expect pricing issue and problems with billing.. check recheck and check again... you have been warned... you will have some two'ing and fro'ing with customer services to ensure you are billed as described on there website..\nensure you copy the order to the company via email in euros and ensure that matches the charged billing.. request your order to be dispatched in one box, as this makes billing simple and easier.. use a credit card as you have purchase protection..\nbut bt are a good company and for a retail company with many shops and stores physical stocking can be purchased in shop so not be available in reality online even though stock is available to be purchased... this is to be expected.. dont be upsett or disappointed if you have some items in orders to be unavailable... this is just a fact of retail and stock availability... trust me I know...\nbut heed my warnings when you shop with them follow the simple rules above and you will obtain some great kit at ridiculously cheap prices..\nso to recap..\norder in euros.. photo the website prices of the items orderd, use a credit card to ensure protection. copy the prices of ordered item to them with an email requesting confirmation the items will be charged as advertised. keep in contact with company and request all items in one box, expect stock delays as they are collected from each shop.. and check re check and check again both items received have been charged at the prices displayed...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T08:29:38.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

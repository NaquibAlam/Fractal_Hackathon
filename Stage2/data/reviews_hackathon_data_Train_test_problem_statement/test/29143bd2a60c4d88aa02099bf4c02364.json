The medium in the picture on the Avas site shows more than 25 roses and carnations. I received 8 roses and 4 carnations. I refused to accept the delivery. I called Avas and after a 52 minute phone call, I was told that the proper bouquet would be resent along with some chocolates for my inconvenience. I received nothing. I called the florist who delivered the original flowers and they said that their order from Avas called for 4 carnations and 8 roses. They also said that there was no replacement order.

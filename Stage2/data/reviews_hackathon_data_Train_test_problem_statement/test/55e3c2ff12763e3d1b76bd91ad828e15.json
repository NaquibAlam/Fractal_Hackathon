The first 2 months I had the giftcard every outfit I liked had at least 1 piece of it that was sold out in my size. Finally this month new things come out that I like and are in my size. I add things to my cart that totaled $50 so I could use my $50 giftcard. When I enter my giftcard it removes all the promo prices and my $50 order turned into a $110 order. So after the giftcard the total would have been $60 for me to pay. Fabletics literally wanted me to PAY $10 to throw my giftcard in the trash. Completely unacceptable. So if you are thinking of buying a giftcard for someone so they can try Fabletics.. do NOT do it! Giftcards I guess are only for people who are already members and already paying full price for the clothes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:05:20.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Hooked it up, worked once, then unable to turn it on in again. Printed return label. Returned item via post office and waiting for a refund, which appears may take quite a while to occur. Usually buy from Am#zon, there return policy and refund policy are a lot more consumer friendly. Can not say if Groupon is a good or bad service there yet. AS A FIRST PURCHASE, VERY BAD, PRODUCT WISE. Packing left way to much room for the product to slide around in the box. Again. Will see if refund process makes up for it. Not sure what company does the packing. Price was nice if it worked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:40:55.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

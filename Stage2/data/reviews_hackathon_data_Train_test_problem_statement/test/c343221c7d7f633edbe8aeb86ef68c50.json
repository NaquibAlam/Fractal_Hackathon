Clicked the button to check for coupons and set up an account as it asked but it cleared my shopping cart! So I had to start over. Then I accidentally clicked the wrong color on one of the light covers I was ordering and I could NOT get it to delete from the cart. I tried several times to change the quantity to 0 and update the cart but nothing happened. Also tried clicking the box under the \"x\" thinking that might remove it and clicking update cart, but it never would. So now I have an extra light cover I don't really need. Then the shipping turned out to be $15 - almost as much as the order!!! For standard shipping. And to top it all off, because of all the trouble I had, I forgot 3 items I needed to order. But now I don't really want to go back and order them because I'm not willing to pay another $15 in shipping to get them Very frustrating experience with the online order!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T15:25:57.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

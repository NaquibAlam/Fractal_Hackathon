Shortly after receiving the confirmation email, lastminute.com called me to say the booking could not be fulfilled and I would not be charged.\nI've now received my credit card statement, and surprise surprise I have been charged. I've called lastminute.com to get them to refund the amount, and they're saying they have no record of calling me, and as far as they're concerned the booking was confirmed.\nFortunately I booked this on AMEX who have been very helpful and can see that I then booked another flight after this was cancelled, directly with the airline, so it's clear I wouldn't have done that for no reason.\nAnyway... just avoid lastminute.com. They are a site of the 90's and that is where they should have stayed!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:38:38.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

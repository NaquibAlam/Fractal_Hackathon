I immediately received an SMS from the bank informing me that my account had been debited. A few hours letter I was informed that that the booking was cancelled because my card failed a security check. They went on to say \"No charge has actually been made to your account\" How ridiculous is that statement when I have my bank statement in front of me and money has been debited out of my account?\nI called the call center and the agent informed me that they have already refunded me and I will receive the payment within 24 hrs, I requested for a confirmation email so I could chase the refund with my bank and again I was told I will receive the email within 24 hours....Two days later I have received no email or refund.\nWe had to cancel the trip because we had no other funds to book that trip. Now we can only make other arrangement when lastminute finally refund us, if they will ever do. Its very annoying that we now have to work with your timelines with absolute uncertainty about when the trip will happen!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:06:59.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

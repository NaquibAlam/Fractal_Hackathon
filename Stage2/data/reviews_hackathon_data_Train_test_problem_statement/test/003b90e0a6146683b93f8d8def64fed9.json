It arrived in a plain cardboard box that clearly was NOT the manufacturer's box. It otherwise looked ok, and so I hung it up and plugged it in. It was defective. Horribly so. Weird bright lines and lights all over the left side of the screen.\nI immediately called to return the item. After explaining that I couldn't just take this 70\" TV to the post office to return and that it arrived via freight, the \"customer service\" rep said that the shipper will come to pick it up and that I will receive a refund 10 days later. Not ideal, but I waited.\nA week later, I called to find out why the tv had not been picked up. The rep apologized and said that the shipper will contact me to schedule a pick up. That never happened, of course.\nI called back a week later, and said that I was going to have to sue if the shipper did not contact me soon. The \"customer service\" rep said that he would \"escalate\" the matter, but he could not explain what that meant!\nI then filed a complaint with AmericanExpress, hoping they can force a reverse charge, and I am also going to file a suit in small claims court if AmEx cannot resolve the issue for me.\nDO NOT EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:07:55.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

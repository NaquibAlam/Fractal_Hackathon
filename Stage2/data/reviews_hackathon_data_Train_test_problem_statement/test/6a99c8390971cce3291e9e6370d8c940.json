He directed me to a link to buy the large arms for the amplifier. I bought them. They were too big. I needed a replacement to the original smaller arms. Why did he have me buy the larger ones? The when I brought to his attention that these arms were too big and that I needed the smaller ones he said I could sent the larger ones back and he would issue an RMA to replace the large ones with the small ones. The large ones cost $ 6.99, return shipping on the large ones would cost the same. So it would cost me about $ 14 to get the right ones that I needed. In the mean time I found the missing small arm and now have a set of the large ones that I can either pay to RMA or just keep them and save the return shipping. What's the point of the RMA. NONE. What was the point of buying the large ones, NONE.

Between Paypal over the course of five/six days of promised calls (Jonas in specialist department, Arise and Sarah all in phillappeane along with Kay the supervisor who put the phone down on me when I wanted to complain about a twenty six minute hold on the line without someone coming back to me) back and many other ill processes with my account. I was not able to purchase the item that I really wanted to buy. EBay and PayPal had many options to allow this transaction to go through, but failed in its duties.\nMany contradictions with what you are proposing, you would know as these remedies and more was attempted! You should listen to the calls and since you say your not in a position of authority, it makes me more saddened that you have intervened in my complaint, where you don't have full authority to investigate.\nTo direct you, if you think all of what you are requesting was not tried over a period of more than 10 hours, you must be reinformed. I even tried making payment from my partners account. Open new accounts and tried paying. Went through to specialist teams numerous times and had the accoun reset.\nI specifically asked your team a number to f times to overide, make a manual adjustment, for me to pay PayPal and complete the transaction. I asked for anything possible over this tedious time to complete this transaction. Since then the supplier has pulled the item becaus of all the communication he received from PayPal and EBay. Which also relates to only part of the times I had contacted with both.\nI was awarded Â£20 compensation and I do not feel this relevant for my time, phone calls or stress caused. Again the seller wanted to sell, I wanted to buy this item and between Between EBay and PayPal the item was lost for my purchas because of maladminstration and errors.\nIt's to note that I have purchased many items before and after this. With no issues at all. That I tried four different credit cards from four different EBay accounts. The problem was with EBay and PayPal and not my credit or bank details. I want a full investigation from the CEO office, compensation, letter of apology and explanation for what I have been through. I asked both EBay to pull the listing and recreate a new one, manually let me pay it or alternatively let me pay EBay and EBay pay for the item on my behalf, all were said it could not be done. But in your response you are actually stating that a manual payment could be done, which is now even more upsetting.\nYour customer resolve has left me without the item I wished to purchase and I am greatly upset for this.\nPlease pass this onto your CEO and progress this complaint. You record your calls and I suggest someone listens to them for verification of my my complaint and what went wrong. It's also to note that I did not get a number of call backs as promised from your supervisors Aris in phillapeane, Jonas and Sarah. This poor service at such a high level details the lack of professional service received.\nI have already detailed my concerns on one complaint website and will do further as this matter over a five day period was exhausting and you should have been able to resolve this small issue, somehow or someway to purchase this item.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:13:46.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

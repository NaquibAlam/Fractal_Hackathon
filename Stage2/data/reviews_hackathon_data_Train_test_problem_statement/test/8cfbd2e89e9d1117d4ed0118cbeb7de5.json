To my surprise the phone has problems with quality and some important features are not working or stopped working within first 4 days. No telephone number to contact the customer service, they can be contacted only by email. Coolicool is not ready to refund my money, they are offering a free repair, which I am not in agreement.\nOverall, I DO NOT recommend to purchase anything. Buy something from local store or local online store where refunds are provided without any questions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:10:28.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

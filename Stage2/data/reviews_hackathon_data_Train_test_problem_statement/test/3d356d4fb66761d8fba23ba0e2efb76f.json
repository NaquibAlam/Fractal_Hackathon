I was also initially charged a lower price only to be told later I'd have to pay more. That's right, they Quote: d a price, took my payment, sent my receipt and trip confirmations, and contacted me weeks later to say I owed more. They were unresponsive to my initial questions about the increased fee, and I started getting automated email warnings that my trip would be canceled and I'd lose my original payment. They also refused to honor the original price, which, again, I'd already paid in full and received confirmation for. Since they already had my initial payment, and I wasn't clear on whether that would be refunded or lost, as their automated messages said that payment could not be refunded, I went ahead and paid the additional price to protect the money I'd already paid. The trip itself was wonderful--absolutely fantastic!-- although it was sub-contracted and so not run by Intrepid at all. Turns out, we could have booked the same trip at a lower price through other companies. I can't say enough about how great the trip was (thanks to our guide!), and how poorly we were treated by Intrepid customer service and taken advantage of by unscrupulous business practices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:37:43.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

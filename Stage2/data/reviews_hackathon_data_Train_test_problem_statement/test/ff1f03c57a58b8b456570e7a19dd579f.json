I gone through the artical written by lenskart Only Site: \"http:// articles.lenskart.com /do-you-own-a-fake-ray-ban.html\" and found this lines \"The inner part of the right temple arm of an original Ray-Ban pair features a style name followed by the name of the country of manufacture, along with the letters CE which stand for ‘European Conformity’. The letters, font, alignment, spacing and the positioning of the characters should be examined carefully.\"\nBut when I Checked the product Received only \"Ray Ban\" is written over there.\nAlso the temples are very tight and fonts and alignment is not looking original.Also the box says manufactured by Ray ban sun optical India when I searched for the company I didnt found found any authentic Quote: s or website.\nI also checked with the local authorised retailers they also confirmed that it was a fake product.\nI suggest to not buy any product from lenskart. Better invest some more money and buy from authentic site or store.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:16:04.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I couldn't see where to enter my name, because the writing was very faint, so my name was entered wrong on my ticket. When I tried to confirm my ticket with one of the airlines, they told me my name was entered incorrectly and I needed to have it corrected. We called Bravofly and they said the nothing could be changed on my ticket information and we told them we wanted our money back. They said they could only give us a partial refund and if we wanted a refund back the same way that we paid, we had to call them back or they would only give us a voucher. We are very upset and angry with the whole thing. Do not book with Bravofly! Website has poor design and you won't every get your money back if something goes wrong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:44:43.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I called Flighthub to enquire what went wrong. They told me to contact the airline. I called the airline, and they said they have no record of her flight and that I should go back to Flighthub. I called them again, finally they admitted that they made a mistake and that they were going to refund the money. But that was one way of getting rid of me. Since Oct 2016 up to now, I have called 14 times asking for the refund. Every time I call, it falls to deaf ears. Their agents are useless and unable to help. Now I see that they are just crooks that I will never get my money back. My advice, hope that everything goes OK, but don't expect to get any help once they mess up with your flight and you get stranded at the airport. I don't trust them any more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:41:39.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

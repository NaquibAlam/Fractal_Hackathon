First delivery missing one fence and all clips. Second order received 2nd fences and only one package of clips. Its was supposed to be two fences and two packages of clips. They told me to do what ever with the first order with no clips. Finally I said lets cancel everything and I'll return all items for a full refund. That process of refund took 5 weeks and 6-7 phone calls to get refund after they had proof of tracking refund, They constantly blame their supplier and have very poor control of their order process as they will not do anything with their customer service in a timely manner for continual order errors.

If its someone with an attitude, no real knowledge repeating the same phrase etc...\nFor many issues that overwhelm the average chat service person you are referred to send a mail to sales or other part of the company, and of course most are left unanswered.\nThey have an automatic renewal policy and adding money on the bill if you did not receive the mail like it was in my case, since it was bought for a client. Then they add more and more fees.\nI had 8 domains with them, and their lack of flexibility and attitude once I realized a domain I never used got AUTOMATICALLY renewed and was charged a reminders fee, made me cancel all of them after their lack of understanding and having a condescending attitude about it. After many mails they agreed to take the reminders fee out ( around 100kr and left another 130 kr or so for me to pay) but they did not cancel the renewed subscription, although I told them the money could stay with them and be used towards my existing domains.\nThe way I was talked to, was off putting. I ended up not paying it - I forgot- and from 130 kr or so it became 650 in 2 months. But the catch is I did not know. ITS NOT SHOWN on the dashboard of the site, and I found out by accident when I asked their chat service. And no, I received no mails. The debt company got my old adress from them so if I had not asked, I would never had known. BUT here is what gets to me there was a red link on the dashboard,asking you to renew your domain, once you said ADIOS drawing attention. Why is there not a red link to say \"something is happening with your bill\" and give you a chance to fix it? I never planned to renew, or delay my payment but ended up being in the wrong, treated as a bad payer, because of the way things are divided between mail only notifications ( which you can miss) and dashboard, creating a dependency and in my case, a huge problem.\n.\nI guess adding fees and putting me through all that, legally they are in their right, I should have been more careful, less trusting, taking care of my interests , hovering over my junk mail, read the totality of their mails to the fine print, but to me, its no healthy way to do business. And I frankly can not do that. I have no time. Mistakes happen, I take responsibility for mine. But their attitude towards the problem that happened was off putting.\nIf the client is brought to FEEL irrelevant, Stupid, and used, just a wallet, than the SERVICE is bad.\nThe company seems to lack the understanding of who their clients are, people like me, who are not web designers and probably not very acquainted with computers, searching for simplicity. To stop the automatic renewal of a domain, we need to ASK them and get a link that expires in 24 hours (WHY? Why ask them, why expiring? This is a website tool service, why is it failing to provide ALL the autonomy to the client and give him all the info he needs on his dashboard?) Little detail, my dahsboard still shows 134 kr and not 630. Just saying....What would have happened if I had found out 6 months from now?\nIts all a mess.\nI found the experience to be extremely time consuming, frustrating, which defeats the purpose to go to a ready to go wbsite builder tool. As a user I feel I am depending on their good grace for the important stuff and my autonomy is partial. So all in all the whole experience was very frustrating and sad.\nThe fact they want to respond, or have reported peoples opinions in here to do damage control, is even sadder.\nPs: I still have an active domain with them due to the fact that I did not find the time to start over and take it somewhere else. But I will be leaving them completely after the expiration dates as I have stopped the other 8 domains I had.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:30:10.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

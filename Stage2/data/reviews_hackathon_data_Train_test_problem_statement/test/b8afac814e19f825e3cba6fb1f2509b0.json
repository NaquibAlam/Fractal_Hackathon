However, the flowers were only delivered at 8pm to my girlfriend's office, which of course my girlfriend was no longer there to receive the flowers.\nI would at least expect the florist shop to contact myself or my girlfriend (both of our details were provided when ordering) to arrange for a delivery to a different address when the delivery was expected to be late.\nI believe the quality of the service is significantly below what I would expect as a professional service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:39:43.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

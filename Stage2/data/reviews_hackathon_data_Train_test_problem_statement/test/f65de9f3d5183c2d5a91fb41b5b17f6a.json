I took the adult and pediatric CPR, AED and Basic first aid course.\nI do want to note that the instructor of the class did a very good job teaching, was very thorough and was open for questions. That is not why I am disappointed.\nI have waited 3 years to get into nursing school and needed this certification as a last check to get in. My deadline was quickly approaching and I had still not received my certification. I had sent multiple e-mail's to the corporate office requesting a certification and no answer. TWO MONTHS LATER I received an email certification which was (thank goodness) excepted by my school.\nOn another note, I paid to receive a basic first aid kit after the completion of the course. When I approached the instructor about it, she had no idea what I was talking about.\nSO... GETTING TO THE POINT, I TOOK THIS COURSE ON 11/16/2016 AND AM STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE MY CERTIFICATION CARDS AND FIRST AID KIT IN THE MAIL!\nDon't ever sign up through this company, they took my money and have not followed through on what I paid for.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T22:27:36.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The booking engine accepted my request and I paid by credit card. Shortly after that I got an email from them saying that the room I booked was not available. I was also assured that no charge has been made on my credit card. The amount has only been \"frozen\". The amount paid was in pounds, converted into euros, and my card was actually charged and the amount returned the following day. Due to the change in the currency rates, I got back less than what was charged on my card. I am still waiting to hear what their \"investigation\" resolves. There have been no response to my emails. I am puzzled as to why the booking system lets you to choose and pay for a room that is not available, why they assured me that no charge has been made on my card when a charge was made, and why they are acting so poorly by not responding to my email enquiries which have been quite civilized. My bank tells me it is not their issue but rather lastminute's. Needless to say, I am never going to use lastminute again. Luckily I did not lose much but this is a matter of principle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T21:25:08.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

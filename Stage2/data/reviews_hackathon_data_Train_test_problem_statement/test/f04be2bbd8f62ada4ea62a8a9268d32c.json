I tried a bite and could tell it wasn't gluten free and had to immediately spit it out. I have a very serious allergy and this is not okay. I called to customer service to get this straightened out and the lady put me on hold twice to call the restaurant, then she said she was fixing my order and would call me back with the details. She never called me back and I never got the correct food. I'm extremely upset with this horrible service and will never use foodler again, and I suggest that you don't either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:04:32.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

And guess what --- not a single dime of it is covered. It should be noted within 2 weeks of getting the car, there was OVER $600 dollars worth of repairs. The Buick repair shop told me there was no possible way this car was checked prior to selling. They came out and said I was screwed. I now pay OVER $500 a month on the car, plus $120 on full insurance (which is required by Drivetime) to have a car that doesn't work. Didn't even get to enjoy the car for a full 6 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:44:30.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

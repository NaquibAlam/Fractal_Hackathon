The lady suggested that I call the card carrier. I told her that I would call the carrier and then call her right back. When I spoke with American Express Rep. she said that my card was active and there should be no problem. She also stated that there was no evidence on their side that any attempt to place a charge had occurred. When I called back (just a few minutes later) and spoke with the American Flag rep. she said that the order was cancelled! She said that they would credit my card. If the charge didn't go through then how were they able to put the credit through? Will not deal with this company again.\nPatricia Stafford", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:32:46.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

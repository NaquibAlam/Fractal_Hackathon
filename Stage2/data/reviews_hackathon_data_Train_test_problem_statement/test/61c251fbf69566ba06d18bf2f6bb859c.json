One of the supports was drilled at an angle resulting in a screw hole aligned to the edge. THis piece has to be replaced. Customer service is some what helpful but parts fulfillment is slow. I like the rack case, but I spent days trying to figure out how to properly mount everything to fit my existing rack rails. After five attempts I figured out a method that would allow me to close the front door with the back door mounted and using my existing slides. This configuration unfortunately does not work with the three shelves or the middle support brackets shipped with the cabinet. They are very shallow compared to the depth of the cabinet. Assembly has been a very frustrating and time consuming experience. This is not my first rack installation, but I hope it is my last. Update: I did receive my replacement brackets and they sent an extra one for some reason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:50:48.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

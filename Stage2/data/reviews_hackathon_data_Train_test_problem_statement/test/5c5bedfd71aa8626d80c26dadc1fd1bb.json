The customer support, however, has left me high and dry. There has been a two-day system wide login outage, meaning you can't login and use your account. You also cannot call support, because you can't login and only actively logged in paying members can call. I had to hunt and peck to find out what was going on, to find a relatively obscure listing for the 'known issue' in their support forum. When I submitted a support ticket to request status updates and be notified when the service was up and running again I received an inadequate/lazy response from support rep, who then closed my ticket as 'resolved'. He advised me that I would have to keep checking back to the support forum to get any info or updates, done, end of story. No email to customers about the issue, no updates, no indication as to when the service may be available so I can plan accordingly... wasted my time and affected my client workflow. Would NOT recommend PAID & UPGRADED PREMIUM PLANS for any 'real' application, it would be fine if you're just using for fun. Bottom line, do not pay for this... the company is not functioning at a paid service level.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:20:55.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

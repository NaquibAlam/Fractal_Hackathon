Wish I could give 0. Found a link to the site through tripadvisor and made a hotel booking. 2 days prior to the booking called the hotel to double check, no booking existed. Called Amoma and was told they would call back in a few minutes, 4 hours later I hadn't received a call so I called (from the USA to Switzerland at my own expense). Was told they were still working on it, meanwhile i'm on my honeymoon and have nowhere to stay the following night. Fast forward to 12pm the next day and still no call so I call back again, it has now been 24 hours since they were going to call me back in \"a few minutes\". Verbally guaranteed my booking was confirmed at my original booking so I begin the 5 hour car ride to my accommodation which I would have begun much earlier had I know my booking was confirmed, that no one bothered to inform me about. 2 hours into the journey I get nervous and decide to call the hotel - would you believe it, no such booking existed. Fed up and frustrated I booked an overpriced bnb at the last minute on New Years Eve. Still have not received a call from Amoma now 5 day on - i've been told they're looking into it and will contact me within the next 30 days. This company is seriously a joke. If you want your vacation ruined then go ahead and book with these crooks. Horrible customer service, bookings don't exist. Disappointed TripAdvisor deal with these crooks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:55:20.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

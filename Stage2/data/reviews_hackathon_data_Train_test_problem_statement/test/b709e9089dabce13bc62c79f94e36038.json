Company did not bother to make sure they had plugged in everything. We had to do it. We watched a show that evening. The next morning we woke with backaches and decided to return chairs. 30% restocking fee, transport fees plus we were told we had to package the chairs. When I responded the White Glove Company took the packing material...I was told to get little boxes, open them up and tape them together. We are 69 years old and those chairs are heavy. Totally uninterested in being helpful. Would not recommend this company ever!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:14:19.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I carelessly purchases a flipbook generator plugin for my website. It was only $35 with a $2 \"handling fee\"; however, upon downloading, I noticed it did not work at all with Google Chrome. There was a visibility issue with the CSS coding which did not work with Chrome. So, I decided to file for a refund.\nI, like millions of others, hate asking for support on a product. I know mistakes happen and bugs are inevitable; but a \"finalized\" product should be ready to use without huge problems like the one I had. So rather than spend hours trying to communicate with the author to try to find a solution, I just thought it best to get a refund, BUT instead of detailing my problems with the product, I simply said that it was a \"mistaken purchase.\" Sure enough, the author approved my refund, but alas, Envato did not. Envato gave me store credit instead of a refund.\nI then replied to their email clarifying that there WAS a problem with the plugin, but they have yet to email me back. I'm not worried about the $37 or the time I spent trying to resolve this issue; however, I'm just upset and disappointed that a company can run this way.\nSo please, to everyone reading this that intends to use Envato, don't purchase anything unless you've done your research or can do without the money you spend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T17:55:04.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

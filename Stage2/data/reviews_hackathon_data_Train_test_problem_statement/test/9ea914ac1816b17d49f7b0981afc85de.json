We actually got to the desk at 19:10, really ignorant staff then sent us on a hunt (on our own) to find the car 60+ meters away from the airport office. Its now dark outside looking for it in a dark compound. Once we found the car we noticed SUBSTANTIALLY more damage on the car than the damage form showed. we noted about 40+ other dents & scratches. So we had to go back in, but of course easier said than done as there was a massive queue. To cut a really long story short, DONT USE GOLDCAR unless you enjoy hassle & queuing.\nThere were 4 members off staff & i remember how one of them just left the office for her break carrying a banana, smirking at us as she left seeing how frustrated we all were.\nWe still havent received the Â£1051 they debited from our credit card because we refused their extortionate insurance. The damage on the car was all really old so it seems they debit customers but dont bother repairing the damage. Some of the damage was rusty it was so old.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:13:03.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

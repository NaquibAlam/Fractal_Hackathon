The same thing happened again, never received shipping notification, I called back and asked what the issue was and they said I had to choose another item as they were out of the one I wanted again.. fed up with the whole process I asked for my VIP membership and my order to be cancelled and all of my money back. It is just now, 1 year later, that they gave me a gift card with my money back. Hopefully I actually get my order this time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:54:49.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

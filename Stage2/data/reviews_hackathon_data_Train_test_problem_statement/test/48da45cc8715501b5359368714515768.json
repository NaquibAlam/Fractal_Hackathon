Moving back and forth from the cart to the rest of the page was very difficult as too many things are consistently popping up.\nMy biggest upset: After spending time deciding in between which two promos I wanted to choose, I finally decided i wanted the Unix outfit. I tried to add it to cart, and it couldn't be added. I thought perhaps it could be a problem with my computer which i restarted but it was not. I wanted that specific outfit because I really liked the Lisette full leggings - not the ones that are 3/4 length which are sold on the leggings page, but the full leggings which are not. Called customer service. They couldn't figure it out either.\nDisappointed in the failed attempt with customer service trying to add it to my cart. Sad because I had to order a different set of leggings.\nHopefully you guys fix the problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:36:35.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

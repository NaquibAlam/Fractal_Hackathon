I first tried FlightHub because it was the easiest route. When I went to book my flight, I got \"your flight could not be booked at this time. Please try again later\". I had no reason to believe this flight was booked, your website said it wasn't, and I did not receive a confirmation email. So I went straight to the Airline and booked through them.\nLong story short. I found out by looking at my credit statement that I was charged twice and had a painful experience with the airline and my credit card company to get my money back. Thankfully I did.\nSince then I've not use this website again until recently because it has the best price. Other than this problem, I appreciate the cheap prices, and the convenience of looking for the best flights for me. And your app is well made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T23:05:03.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

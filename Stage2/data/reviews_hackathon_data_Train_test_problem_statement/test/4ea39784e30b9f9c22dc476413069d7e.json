Tried live chatting with a rep 12 times over the course of 3 hours and did not hear back at ALL. Finally decided to call, spoke to a robot for 20 minutes before they forwarded me to a rep but I was hung up on. Tried again and was finally able to speak to a real person. Received a confirmation email that my VIP membership was cancelled and they cancelled my order all together. Based on these reviews, I am going to bet I still continue to get charged for the VIP membership. Any more charges and I am going to FLIP!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:07:59.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

As each day passed waiting in anticipation for my item to arrive only get to get the phone call 4 days later frustrated me.\nTheir only solution was to sell me a more expensive cold air intake with a $20 discount, witch i would have gotten on my own through a promo code had i ordered the other intake then thay mentioned free shipping witch you get!\nS what was my compensation for my disappointment and my inconvenience. What was supposed to be shipped to my house within 2 to 3 business days which would have been Wednesday 22nd or Thursday 23rd now I won't see until the following week or as they say two to three business days which would be next Tuesday 28th or Wednesday 29th, if it was my company I would have apologized profusely for my error and I would make sure that the customer satisfied and happy, and if it meant eating the cost of overnight shipping or giving the customer the other product for the price he or she paid for the first one that's just good business, as I said in the beginning make your own opinion. As for me I only give one chance at earning my trust in good business. As I share my story with my friends it will not be a good review therefore I'll try alternative companies in ordering in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T09:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:41:26.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

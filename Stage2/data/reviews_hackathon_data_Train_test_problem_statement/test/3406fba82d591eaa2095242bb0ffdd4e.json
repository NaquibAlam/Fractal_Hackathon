When I phoned up to explain what happened I was informed that it was up to the hotel whether or not the room could be cancelled and whether I will be refunded for one of the rooms. I was told they would get back in touch with me however they hadn't done so yet. I then phoned the hotel and stated that I have spoken to someone from lastminute.com who said the hotel are the ones who need to refund me. To be told that this is incorrect and that they don't have my money, that lastminute.com do. When I phoned lastminute.com back they tried to say that the hotel will only offer me to have the room but to change the date for another time which I did not want. They then went on to say that room can still be cancelled and I won't get a refund. So I have spent double the price on 1 room! Furious! Do not use this company!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T18:08:58.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

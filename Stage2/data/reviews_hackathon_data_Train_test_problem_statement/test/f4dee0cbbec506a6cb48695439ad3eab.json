Went online and put my order in (then to my immense frustration got an email the very next day with a $50 discount on my bike, argh!!), and had the bike delivered with no issues at all.\nThe bike is great, love the retro look, the colours, and the style. Only frustration is that the gearing isn't working well, and it slides out of 1st gear quite a lot (fun when you're climbing up a hill to have it slip on you!).\nOther than those two minor issues, it's all good :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:37:37.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

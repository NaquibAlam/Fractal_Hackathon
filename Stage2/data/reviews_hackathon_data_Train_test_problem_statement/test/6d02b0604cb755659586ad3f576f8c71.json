Suddenly it wasn't available at that price, more expensive.\n2) the price with taxes and fees in was suppose to be a little over 1200 ..my husband was sitting next to me to verify this. And when it went through we were charged over 1600. But we were to exhausted to fight it after what occurred earlier that day\n3) earlier that day I made a purchase and took their extended cancellation fees. Thank goodness I did! because when we purchased it a different flight was booked. So we lost 50.00 there because it's for cancellation only\n4) extended cancellation should give you 24 hours to change flight in case of errors without penalty. 225.00 per person to change. I cancelled flight instead. Did not want or trust to book again so husband get it and we had the issue with the cost difference.\n5) Your customer service were like robots!\nOverall not the pleasant experience and feel that I was taken advantage of between the 50 earlier that day and 500.00.00 in the evening. Hope this isn't their usual service or treatment ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:40:16.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

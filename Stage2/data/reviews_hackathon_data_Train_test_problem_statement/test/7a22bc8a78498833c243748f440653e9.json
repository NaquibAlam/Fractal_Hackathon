I am only looking for 40-50k now. I was told I can re apply after 6 months and get better rate and more money, well Ondeck is not making it easy with their regulations. I bring in on average per month 28-30k it can be one, two,or more jobs per month, they will not give me a loan because I had two jobs in a month at $35k, they would rather see 5 jobs at 15k real crazy to me and very unfair so if you are planning on working with them after half your loan is complete it can be real difficult. I would not recommend using OnDeck Capital because of these regulations.\nWe need President Trump to get rid of these crazy regulations and make it better for the small business owner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:32:05.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

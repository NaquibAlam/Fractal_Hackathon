Ordered 2 rollers and 2 Venetian blinds last July. One roller came wrong size (measurements were correct) and the cord in one the Venetian blinds was worn through when came out of box. It all got fixed after sending photos etc. In November ordered 2 Vertical blinds, one that would draw over to the left and the other that would split in the middle. Waited 10 days for delivery, local guy would have been quicker I'm sure, and when they arrived both blind rails had middle splits instead of one to the left. Screws, brackets and child cord safety loops were missing. This was after getting emails that blinds were made and going through quality checks? Phoned up, had to send pictures etc and they said they would express make another rail and send out the missing pieces. 2 days later got screws, brackets and child safety loops but it was another 10 days before rail arrived! Took longer than original order! Express?? Now 4 months later the vertical blind with the middle stack's rail clicks really loud and gets stuck when trying to turn the blinds. I have other vertical blinds from them in the house that work fine and quality is superior. I think in the strive to be cheap they have let quality slip. It's a shame because they used to be a good fast service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:26:52.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

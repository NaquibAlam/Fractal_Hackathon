So much so, that I went to Amazon and bought a replacement bulb for 1/3 of what BenQ was asking.\nThe lamp arrived and 'almost' fit perfectly. It certainly worked, as my picture was restored and I could use my projector again. It was only about 30 minutes later that I noticed the smell. Definitely electrical, almost like an overheating odor.\nAnother quick call to BenQ and my fears were confirmed. The off-brand lamp was probably overheating the ballast to the lamp. Not wanting to ruin my projector or at the very least find myself subject to additional repair costs, I ordered the genuine replacement from BenQ with priority shipping (it was almost superbowl weekend).\nThe service people have been amazing at every turn. Sympathetic to my sticker shock, they were never pushy. Needless to say, the new lamp arrived before the weekend, and the smell hasn't returned. Unlike the knock-off lamp from Amazon, this replacement bulb fit perfectly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T19:43:00.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

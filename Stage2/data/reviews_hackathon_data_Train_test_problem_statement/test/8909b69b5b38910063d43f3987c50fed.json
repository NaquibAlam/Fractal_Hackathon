After 2 months, Netflix starts blocking it on Playstation. We talk to them and they manage to get it up and running a few days later. But we constantly get disconnected. They tell us to wait while they fix their services. We wait a while, nothing and they keep telling us to wait until next month. So after 4 months of issues we talk to them and request a refund as they are unable to resolve this. They deny us the refund as \"We used their service for more 6 months\". Though we barely used it for 3 month and they told us to wait until they fixed it.\nWould not recommend their services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:50:59.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

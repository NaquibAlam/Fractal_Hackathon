I think the filters work great but I have a problem with salt free softener portion of the system. The biggest disappointment comes with how Pelican advertises the system without telling you the whole truth. If you consider buying one, you have to understand that this is not a water softener but rather a water conditioner. The system is not removing calcium and magnesium from your water but rather changes the minerals into \"harmless\" crystals in a process called physical water treatment. Pelican claims that the system is certified for 99.6% prevention of scale buildup. Perhaps this is true when it comes to liquid state of water; so it will not affect your plumbing (inside of your pipes). But, from my experience, you will see negative effects of hard water everywhere where water evaporates: dishwasher, tips of your faucets and showerheads, toilet bowl, etc. If you have dishwasher, you want to be sure that it has water softener built it or you will ruin your dishes; and make sure that you have an extended warranty on your Keurig coffee maker - lol. On a positive note, the system gives you a lot of benefits over water softeners that use salt. But, I don't understand why Pelican does not tell you everything that you need to know to make a fully informed decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:37:40.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

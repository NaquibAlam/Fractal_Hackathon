From the moment I arrived in Cuba, things were disappointing. I waited a long time at the airport before someone eventually picked me up and then was dropped off at an room a long way from the old town. I was charged an extra $100 a night for my very basic room which was nearly a one hour walk from the old town, so ended up having to pay more money for taxis. There were similar guest houses right in the city centre for only $30 so I know intrepid was hugely overcharging me. Once the tour started, our tour guide was quite aloof and seemed to resent any questions which were asked if him. He was grumpy and at times downright rude and did not seem to enjoy his job. The bus wheels squeaked for the whole 9 days, which was both annoying and dangerous. For the money the tour cost, the whole experience was overpriced and disappointing. I will not use intrepid again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:40:17.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

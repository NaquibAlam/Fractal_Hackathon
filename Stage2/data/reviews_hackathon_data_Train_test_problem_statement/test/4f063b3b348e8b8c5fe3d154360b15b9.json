Leiden is in the Netherlands. Nowhere do your tickets confirm validity in the Netherlands. The words \"Any Dutch Station\" is nowhere on the tickets.\nYour tickets are not 'confusing', they are simply wrong.\nCan you tell me if the tickets are valid in Leiden?\nJames Woods\nI booked Leiden - London. The email included tickets only for the Eurostar. I sent an email querying the other tickets, and got no reply. I tried telephoning but the number was constantly engaged. I had to buy new tickets Leiden to Brussels.

Your Eurostar tickets are valid all the way indeed from Leiden to London via Brussels.\nYour connection from Leiden to Brussels is not specifically mentioned on your ticket, as this kind of ticket allows you to take any train (at any time, except Thalys) from any station in the Netherlands to Brussels-Midi.\nWe admit that this may seem confusing by its simplicity. On the other hand, this kind of ticket is not only more flexibel (as it allows you to depart from anywhere in the Netherlands), but also much cheaper than a separate ticket from Leiden to Brussels.\nFeel free to check if you can still get a refund (even partially) for the additional ticket you purchased - which turns out to be superfluous.\nWe nevertheless wish you a smooth and pleasant journey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:27:50.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I looked for reviews and saw that there were a lot of 5-star and 1-star ones which made me hesitate. I am not an optimistic person but I gave miniinthebox a chance. I ordered in hopes of receiving my package in a month at the latest, as the estimated shipping time suggested. I ordered on January 29. March 14 came and I messaged them, they told me to wait until the 24th because there may have been delays. So I waited. 24th came and I messaged them and I found out that my package was lost in transit. The first two tickets a sent, I got a reply within 24 hours. I was actually impressed by that. The third one i sent, I got a reply within an hour. But when I said I wanted a refund, they ignored me. It has been 3 days and my ticket is still unresolved and I have messaged them 4 times. Not a single response. I went into this hoping for a good bargain but now I'm just so disappointed and sad that this happened to me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:03:46.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Corbin told me he would work with the saler to get me new seats to the 7pm. Corbin called and left me a message with an update. I called and left messages with Corbin 3 different times with no response. I then called the main line and Chris assisted me. He told me he would call me back with new tickets because the ones Corbin offered were no longer available. Chris called me back and I confirmed the tickets. He stated he would email them to me. I received no email. I left 2 voicemails with no response. I left 2 voicemails with the main line with no response. I finally got Quinton the day before my event. I was very frustrated and he handled the call well. He reviewed my tickets with me and stated that they were still for the 10pm. Chris had given me the incorrect tickets for 10pm instead of 7pm which was the entire reason for the reissue of tickets. Quinton told me he would call me before 5pm with different tickets. Quinton called me at 3pm with tickets and I accepted. He told me he would email me the tickets. I didn't receive the email so I called back and Quinton confirmed my email address. Quinton remained on the phone until I received the tickets. Quinton's customer service was my only pleasant experience with Ticket City. I will not be using Ticket City in the future for any of my purchases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:35:44.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

In my case, I got the required note from our son's Pediatrician explaining that his stomach virus prevented us from going to Mt Sunapee on the day planned and using the Liftopia tickets that I'd purchased for my wife and I for the Sunday of MLK wknd (the kids tix were included in their ski school, which we of course got a credit for future use for!). I was told that they couldn't help me as the Dr's note met all of their requirements EXCEPT their deadline (10-days after the ticket date) by which it needs to be submitted to be considered for a refund/credit.\nI explained that after that weekend I was on an overseas business trip (8 hrs time difference) so got into an endless game of phone tag with our pediatrician so it took 2.5 wks to get the signed note on letterhead. The response that elicited was priceless: \"if you'd reached out to ask for an extension to the 10-day deadline, we might have considered that but since you didn't we really can't help you\". My multiple requests for an explanation on where the 10-day deadline comes from went unanswered and it quickly became clear that Katie, the Customer Service \"Supervisor\" my call was escalated to, was getting tired of reading her script of talking points so the call just fizzled out.\nThey must be in a real cash crunch these days and their desperation is by no means subtle - and it was really striking how comfortable they were sticking it to a good customer who's used them many times over the past few years. I've seen a lot of amateur decisions in my 20 yrs working in hospitality around the world but the call I had tonight was a new low.\nThe only reason they get even 1 star was the pleasant call I had with Justin when I first called in on Jan 15th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T15:39:31.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

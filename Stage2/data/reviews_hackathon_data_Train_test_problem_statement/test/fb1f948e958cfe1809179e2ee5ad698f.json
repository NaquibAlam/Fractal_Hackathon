And normal maintenance items.\nOur new Ls1630 was close to 3 months late. Arrived with belts loose apparently and the x-axis out of square. Hours spent on phone fix the issue only to have issues of not holding size pop up again. Hopefully fixed for good now. If not I will fix myself since most of the findings were on my end anyways.\nThey are always pleasant to deal with but tend to ignore when you want spare parts.\nWould not purchase again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:58:24.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

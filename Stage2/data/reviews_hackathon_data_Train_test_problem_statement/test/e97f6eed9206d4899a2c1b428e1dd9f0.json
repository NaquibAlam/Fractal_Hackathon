Not being able to get somebody on the phone would be a good place to start. When you do, being sent back to the online system to make changes which the system clearly wasn't capable of was most annoying. Most people live busy lives and require quick and reliable service. This never happens here - and I have unfortunately too many bad experiences here. My wife was getting her car serviced and the garage offered her a loan car for the day! Went online to make temp change only to get \"you fall outside underwriting criteria\". Sent an iMessage for them to call back, when they did, they told us to go online to make the change. We said we did that already, they didn't seem to care. Long story short - they refused a temp cover while her car was in the garage. I have never had a good experience, buyer aware!!! Steer well clear and get to a decent insurance company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:40:30.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

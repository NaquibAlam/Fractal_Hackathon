I ask the woman that greeted us if they had two of a certain couch. She left to check. Another employee came up to us and asked, rather snooty, if we were greeted when we came in. We replied, \"yes!\" Again, with a lot of attitude, she asks, \"By who?\" I really was appalled by her attitude and walked away and let my husband deal with her. Well, the lady helping us comes back and confirms they have the couches. We go to purchase them, and I am all but ready to pay. She asks me if I know how much the couch was. I tell her the price and she walks away. She goes over and speaks with my husband saying that someone must have switched the tag and couldn't honor the price that was listed on the couches. We just walked out the store. I'll try not to shop there....overall bad experience!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:39:56.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They have you automatically taking flight insurance. I booked a flight and saw a final price of $321.85 CDN and was happy. I gave them my credit card info and then after finishing I saw, too late where I was charged for insurance.This made my final bill almost $500. I think \"you\" select insurance, if needed. To me their set up is an underhanded way to get you to take flight insurance. I could find no way to address this and cannot contact them as I am in Europe. Have used them in the past and that is what it will be.\nI am happy to report that Flighthub has refunded the insurance cost and I am impressed with their speedy attention to my concern. I will use them again and now know that flight insurance must be declined. Still believe that selecting it is the correct way to go not the reverse. But thank you Flighthub .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T19:41:01.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

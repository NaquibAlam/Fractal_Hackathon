It arrived quickly and I opened the package to confirm that it was the part that I ordered. It was. Technician came out, and before installing new component, performed some diagnostics on the dishwasher and determined that it needed another component. We decided at that point to get a new dishwasher. I contacted customer service and they sent me the necessary form and instructions for the return. I packed it up in its original packing and box and promptly returned it, tracked it and they received it some time in early December, 2016.. I received an email from customer service on Jan 9, 2017 that the refund had been issued and it would take 4-6 weeks for me to receive the refund. Today, I thought too much time had passed and contacted customer service. Extremely nice and accommodating Charles was there to help, and informed me that the part had been installed and therefore rejected, what ever that means. I told Charles that no, the part had never been installed, and I was surprised that no communication had been initiated and that a company could just arbitrarily reject a returned part and I was out $130 for parts and shipping, and another $10 to ship the part back. Something very wrong here. Incidentally, I was aware of the their return policy regarding electrical components, and is precisely why I asked the technician to perform additional diagnostics before installing the control panel, so it wasn't like I was an uninformed consume. This has been a BIG HASSLE RETURN. Hopefully this will be resolved and I can get my money back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:31:13.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The price was slightly lower than than on Swiss Air so I decided to save the extra bit and go with this agency. I use all sorts of online agencies for years and never had an issue.\nTicket was easy to buy, got my booking confirmation after purchase, so far so good. Then I proceeded to log in to my Swiss Air miles account so I could add the booking to collect miles, add my seats etc.\nThis is where I encountered a problem, the ticket I bought was a no luggage ticket. I have one piece of Luggage and am not flying a low cost airline, also the ticket price was high. I went back to see the fares on their site and did not see anywhere pre purchase the option to add luggage etc.\nI called them straight away but was on hold for over 20 min. so I had to hang up as this was in the evening. So I decided to write them an email with the situation. They emailed back a couple of hours later saying that I had to call Swiss air to add luggage and pay extra!!! But no sorry or lets see if we can help you, maybe refund you and re buy the proper ticket or something.\nSo I decided to call again the numbers provided on the email. One number I called 4 times and there was never any answer and the other one which is the number to speak to agents who can change the ticket kept going to answering service.\nThen I found the number for the sales department and they told me that they could not help me that I had to call the same numbers as above. So basically nobody is dealing with the situation that should have never happened in the first place.\nIf you go on Swiss Air it gives you the options to buy the fares for hand luggage, luggage and fully flexible. even when you click one it asks you again before you purchase ticket. They do not have this here, so was misleading, including the fare which was almost the same as buying it on Swiss Air with luggage.\nI asked the sales department to pass me to a manager who could maybe help to fix the situation and keep me as a client. Of course the Manager was busy, am still waiting to hear from someone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T17:25:45.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

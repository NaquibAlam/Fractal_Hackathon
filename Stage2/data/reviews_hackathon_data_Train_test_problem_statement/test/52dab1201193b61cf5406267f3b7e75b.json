I called at week 5 and was told 2 more weeks and that I would receive an email within 2 days with accurate delivery status. I never received an email. I called at week 6 and was told an additional 4 weeks, minimum! When I explained I was told 2 weeks the week prior, Joma explained the person I spoke to was new and I was misinformed.

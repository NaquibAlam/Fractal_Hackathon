The trees 3 to 4 feet were barely 3 feet. I was one tree short but when I contacted them they asked if I wanted them to ship the tree or refund. I requested a refund and they did refund for the missing tree. Overall I was well satisfied with them and have recommended them to others for trees. I will also buy from them again but will assume that if I want a 4 foot tree I need to order 4 to 5 foot trees not 3 to 4. They are a very honest business and even though I had a problem they quickly took care of it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T21:14:26.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

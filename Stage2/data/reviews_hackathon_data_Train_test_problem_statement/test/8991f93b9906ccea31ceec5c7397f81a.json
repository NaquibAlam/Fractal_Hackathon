But the initial reason I rented was that the rent rate was quite cheaper than any other rent a car company. But to my surprise, when I actually interacted with the company to receive the car, the experience was much more than I expected. First, the van that picked me up at the airport was a Benz, which felt very luxurious and good. Also even though we had over 8 large luggage, the driver was very friendly and was very quick to move the luggage to the trunk. When going in to the Sixt office, it felt very modern and simple and I felt very comfortable. The lady who helped me register was so kind and told me stories about Florida which made me feel fun and entertained and not have to feel bored during the registration like all other company is. But what really surprised me most was when I returned the car with ease because the location of Sixt was not in a building or complex parking lot where you have trouble trying to find it or may become lost somewhere. The Sixt company was on ground floor with a private parking lot where it was so easy returning the car without having to worry about how to find the place. And last but not least after returning the car to the car return lot, the employee was already moving our luggage to the transfer van as I was getting off the rent car. So I had zero time delay in transferring to the transit van. This was the best experience I have ever had from start to finish of my travel ever. I will be using Sixt in the future and it will definitely be my first of choice. I will never be the same after SIxt gave me this kind of experience. Thank you Sixt for your great service and please keep up the great work.\nFrom Korea\nSincerely yours\nYu Sung han", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:54:59.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

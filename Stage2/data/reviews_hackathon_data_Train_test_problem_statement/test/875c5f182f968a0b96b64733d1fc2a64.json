But couldnt have gone smoother. Quick and easy pickup and drop off of car. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. No high pressure tactics to buy into their offered rental insurance (I have my own thru my credit card company). No hassle re amount of gas in tank when returned - simply left it at same level as when taken out - no additional charges (I had read many reviews about how some rental companies gouge you for the gas tank fill up upon return). Took the auto toll payment feature as didnt want to think about it when on the toll roads - apparently you cannot pay these at the toll booth itself. Great experience all around. Great value - paid $65 CAD for 2 weeks! Unlimited mileage.

They were supposed to be delivered by 1pm....and nothing. I called at 3 pm and they stated the delivery guy was minutes away.\nI call again at 5 PM to inquire on the order. I was informed that the driver was nearby and that the order would be delivered any moment. At this point I am done. I informed them that they told me this just 2 hours earlier and that I wasn't falling for it again. I asked to cancel the order and wanted my money back because we weren't going to be home for a few days and that now the order was pointless.\nThey kept refusing the cancellation and kept stating the driver was close. After being on the phone for nearly 30 minutes (flowers still havent shown up) they agreed to cancel the order.\nAround 6 pm the company called me back stating that the florist would need to be paid $5 for their efforts in delivering the flowers. I informed them that if anyone was going to pay this that it would be them. Less than 5 minutes after that call I received a text and email indicating that the flowers had been delivered.\nAround 6:30 pm my wife receives a call from the delivery driver indicating that they were minimum 1 hour away. I informed the driver that the company had contacted the florist and let them know that the order had been cancelled. The driver was unaware of this but thanked me for letting them know.\nOn 2/13/17 I contacted the florist to discuss the matter with them. They told me that Ava's Flowers never contacted them and that they would never charge a $5 cancellation fee.\nThis review is being written for 2 purposes. First for the consumers who may be enticed by Ava's Flowers marketing, don't fall for it. Secondly for all Florists out there, small or large, don't do business with this company. They will not only give their company a bad name but they will also tarnish your name. The florists who received my order was never informed that the order needed to be delivered by 1 PM and that they are never paid any extra money to do so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:01:22.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

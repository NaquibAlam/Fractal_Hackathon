I had my friend on the phone as I made arrangements...so I was distracted....but we needed the room..so we agreed to go ahead and book...by the time we actually booked it was about the same as the others. When I got the email confirmation they had charged me an extra $53 for using my credit card.Right on the first page of the booking process it stated 'no fees for using credit card\" I called and they did refund $53...after quite a lot of discussion...I had to email a screen shot to the agent to prove what it said on their site. There is more....the statement given at the hotel was for almost $500 less than we paid. I emailed Amoma when we got home...but they never replied. This site is not reputable...avoid....they seem cheaper but in the end they are more. Two points to be clear 1. The first page of Amoma.com CLEARLY stated NO fee for use of credit cards...2. Amoma.com charged me $1773. for 2 rms/3nites....when we checked out, the statement from the hotel was for$1298..I don't mind them making a profit....but 30% markup ?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:54:48.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

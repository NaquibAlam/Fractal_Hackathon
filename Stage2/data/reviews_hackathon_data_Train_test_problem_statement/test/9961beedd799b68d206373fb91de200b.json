I can't send an email because the form only accepts US information. I can't phone because the system doesn't recognise the tracking number and when I finally get through it says office closed, and I can't track missing mail as I don't have an account.\nI have used USPS for many years and I have found the customer service of US companies in general exceptional...until now.\nWhy has my package from Connecticut to my home in the UK travelled via Denmark and then Sweden? Why has it been stuck in Sweden for 12 days now with no movement? I know that I can see the tracking information that they see but there must be a reason why it did not come to the UK direct.\nI paid for a priority service with 6-10 business days delivery. The package set off on 30 January. It is now 15 February and it is IN SWEDEN, NOT the UK...and because it says on route to destination on the USPS tracking system, there is no problem as far as they are concerned. DISGUSTING!\nI have tried to get answers but I can't even get a message through.\nMy biggest regret - the seller gave me the option of USPS or FEDEX. I have always found USPS slow but reliable - what a mistake I made this time!!!!\nMessage to the people of the US. USPS represents your country when delivering mail internationally. At the very least I would expect some level of service that gets a package to my door.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:24:03.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

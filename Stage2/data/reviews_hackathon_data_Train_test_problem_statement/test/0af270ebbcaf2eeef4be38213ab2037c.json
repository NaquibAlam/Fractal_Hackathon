When I came in to pick up the phone, at first they could not find it. They said it was brought to the front desk while the person at the desk was at lunch. After looking around, they finally found it in a bag with someone else's name on it!! The girl at the front desk did not seem concerned that my phone was in the bag for someone else!\nAlthough the display was fixed, when I turned the phone over I noticed it was cracked pretty bad on the back! The girl informed me that this is the chance you take when they take your phone apart. She said they could fix it for another $70. I just paid $239 to fix the front, and Fox Paw wants me to pay more to fix the damage they did??\nAgain, the girl was not concerned. She told me that if I kept it in a case I wouldn't have to worry about the cracks in the back.\nTerrible customer service, will not recommend them to anyone and will not use them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T21:43:10.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The first code sent to me was already used. I did get another code from them, but I was asked to contact Microsoft first. Too Much of a hassle to save $10. I should have just got it from Amazon as they sell it for $53 which is only $4 more than I paid at Gamecheap. ★★★'s for that.\nCustomer Service: ★★'s\nAlthough their people answering the phone weren't bad, they weren't adequately professional either. Their phone system sounded like they were answering calls from the TARMAC at LAX. It also took way too many tries to get through to someone. However they did get back to me and eventually corrected the issue. This has potential to be a good service. So, get it together Gamecheap!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:01:51.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

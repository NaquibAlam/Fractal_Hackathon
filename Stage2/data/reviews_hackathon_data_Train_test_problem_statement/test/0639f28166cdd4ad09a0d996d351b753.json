Fine, no issue there, five minutes were not going to kill us.\nNow, three days prior to departure the company has amended our flight operator to a subclass airline.\nI call them up and having been on hold for 30 minutes, the call was cut by the operator. Again I call, another 30 minute wait and again during the call, the call was cut off.\nThe only options they gave me were a full refund or move the flight dates if I wanted to fly with the airline I originally booked with. Both unacceptable as flight prices are now ridiculously high due to only a few days left.\nVery bad customer service and service in general. I will never fly or recommend you to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:20:45.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

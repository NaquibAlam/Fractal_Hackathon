Rather, the actual discount is much less - frequently half of the GCG figure. I concluded that it is not a matter of outdated information, because the actual discount has NEVER been higher. If I can no longer trust the information on GCG, I will abandon it altogether. While I don't want to leave GCG, it is not that much more difficult to create a subfolder in my bookmarks and visit each site independently. I can then be assured of both availability and the exact discount I am to receive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:27:26.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

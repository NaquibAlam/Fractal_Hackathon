When I phoned to book my flight they took all the usual details and then I was told they would just get authorisation to use two cards for payment. I was on hold for about 15 mins (was already on the phone for about 30 mins at that point) and then was told that unfortunately the request was declined with no explanation why. Thinking it was a fluke I called after an hour to try again. This time even longer hold of about an hour. Same result. I phoned a different agency who promptly processed my request and with a ticket that was Â£50 cheaper. Will never book here after my experience.

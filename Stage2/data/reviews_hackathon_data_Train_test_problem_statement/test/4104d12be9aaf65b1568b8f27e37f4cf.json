Even their feedback request was summarily closed - like they really don't want to know what you think of them: a shame as there were some good things to say about the flowers.\nI was a returning customer, but the combination of their agressive marketing techniques, their dishonest dealings and the insulting attitude of their so-called \"Customer Services\" people has ensured that I will not be making use of their services in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:27:03.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I gave it weeks then contacted them. Their customer service is absolutely horrendous, unhelpful and apparently have no answer is other than to just wipe their hands and not be helpful. The fact that after my package was lost I was then told that it was my responsibility as the consumer after my money was taken that I had to deal with it, is beyond me period a company after taking somebody's money should 100% take responsibility and step up. If you don't have a problem taking money from people then work on your business consumer relationships or train your staff better. You chose to hire inexperienced people and not trained them correctly and that is why you are getting such bad reviews. I've asked for a refund repeatedly, I've asked for the order to be resend out, and I have outright been told it's my problem and I have to fix it. I've even had to go so far as to contact FedEx and be told not only over the phone or via email that the company has to put the claim in not the buyer. I do not understand what is so hard about the situation. At this point I am so frustrated all I want is a refund and if I have to go so far as contacting my credit card and putting in a claim I absolutely will you have one chance to remedy this do it or face the consequences is very simple.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:13:19.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

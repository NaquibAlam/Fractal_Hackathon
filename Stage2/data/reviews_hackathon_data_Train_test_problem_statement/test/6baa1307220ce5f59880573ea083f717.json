Their idea and mine of an almost new book are two entirely different things. If I had owned this book, I would not have deemed it good enough to even sell, and I think it is an old library book although they did not state that. It smells really dusty, and I'm debating whether to just throw it away. It had something splattered on the side pages, that the company never disclosed. Had I picked up this book in the store I most definitely would not have bought it. Also, what they called a \"smudge on a corner is actually my definition of a destroyed corner -- it wasn't a smudge. At any rate, I bought the book from gargoyle books, and I think they need to get their act together better as to how they rate the quality of a book.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:24:31.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

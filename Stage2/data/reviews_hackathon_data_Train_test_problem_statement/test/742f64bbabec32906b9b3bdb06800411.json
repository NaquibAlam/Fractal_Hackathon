I ordered Downy dryer sheets and apparently Wal-Mart had the wrong price listed and I was told to contact the sellar which I did. I waited on hold for over 17 minutes before my call was ever even taken. The customer service rep was rude and had a cocky attitude. They would not refund me my full amount although I did not receive all of the product that I ordered, neither would they send me the rest of my order. I am completely discussed by the service and product that I received. I do not recommend buying from this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:27:01.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

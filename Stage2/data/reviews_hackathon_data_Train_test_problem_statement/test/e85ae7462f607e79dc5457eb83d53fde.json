I installed the new back up camera, mirror and related cords and the Tadi Brother's back-up system works fine and dandy. My wife loves it as it really helps when backing up in blind spots and especially at night. It's really neat.\nI am a very satisfied customer and appreciate the way customer rep. Chris, hung in there and gave me all the help I needed. I am really impressed with Tadi Brother's customer support and tech assistance. Chris went that extra mile to make sure I installed it correctly.\nTo supply power for the back up mirror, I found it easy to splice the RED and BLACK wires that power the back up mirror to the same wires that provide power to the driver's adjustable seat. The power connector is right under the seat and is always \"HOT\". Makes installation clean and simple.\nOnce again, THANK YOU Chris for holding true to the TADI\nBROTHERS motto: \"We'll back you up\". I highly recommend this product and it's great customer service.\nJim Pullen, Coral Springs, FL (2/28/2017)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:26:41.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The lady employee tried to persuade us with lame sale tactics (read: they try to scare you off into buying things you don't need).\nAt the car delivery, I noticed several dents and scratches that weren't reported in the check-out paper. We urged the young lady in the garage to take notice and update our papers. She did it, but not completely. She argued most of the damage were of small entity thus not liable of charge.\nSo off we got wrongly believing everything was just fine.\nAt the car drop-off, since it was early in the morning and the office wasn't open yet, we left the keys in the return key-box. My wife and I checked and inspected the vehicle meticulously outside and inside, and there were no damages (except for the ones already reported). After a few days, on my credit card statement I've found â‚¬ 180 charge for damages we have never made and we aren't responsible for.\nI have been fooled by this dodgy company and I will not stop until I get justice.\nI am going to report them to consumers associations both in Italy and Spain.\nTheir dishonest practices need to be stopped. Avoid Goldcar and choose more reliable companies as Hertz and Thrifty, which whom I have never had an issue.\nDon't give them your money and your pace of mind. Don't let them spoil you holidays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:24:15.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

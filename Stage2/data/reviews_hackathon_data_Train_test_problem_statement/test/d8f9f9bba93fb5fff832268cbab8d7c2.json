I should have known the price was too good to be true. The part would 'fit\" in that it would attach to the bolt, but it is much skinnier, and angled differently than the genuine Volvo part. It also does not connect to the wiper blade in the same way as the Volvo part; it leaves an ugly gap between the arm and the blade, while the genuine parts connect almost seamlessly.\nSo, I'm very disappointed, and I go to print a return label, only to find that the label is going to cost me almost the entire cost of the wiper arm.\nI will never use this site again.\n*Update*\nAfter the response below from the website, I confirmed that I did order the correct part, which the site lists as the correct part for my car (the T6 model).\nUpdate 2\nEven after searching with my VIN, the first result is still the incorrect wiper arm that I purchased. The correct arm does show below. I'm not a mechanic. How am I supposed to know my vehicle chassis number? If I select the correct vehicle, the parts that show up should fit my car.

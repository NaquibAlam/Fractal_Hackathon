This is the first time I purchased from HOUZZ and I will never purchase anything from them again. I spent more than $1,700 for a 72 inch vanity and paid for the \"room of choice\" delivery. WHAT A SCAM. The delivery company came to my front door, argued with me that it was just curb drop. After calling their supervisor they confirmed that it was in fact a \"room of choice\" delivery. Then the delivery men argue with me that they can't bring the vanity to my room of choice on the second floor because its too heavy and its only two of them there. I asked why offer service that you can't provide? His response, I paid HOUZZ for the service and they are just subcontractors. After about 25 minutes of discussion back and forth about how heavy it is the vanity was left in my entrance way. I made several calls to HOUZZ and the delivery company but was just placed in voice mail. I finally spoke to a HOUZZ customer service rep who said she would send the \"correct department\" an email explaining what has happened and said that I would get a call back. I never did. I then opened up the box to find the marble back splash broken into 4 pieces and the counter top cracked in 4 places with the back of the vanity split in 2 places. I took 15 photos of the damage and sent an email that same day to HOUZZ asking for a call. Waited. Waited. Waited. Nothing. I waited 2 days, and then I called customer service and was transfer 3 times and then dumped into voice mail. The only way I was able to speak to someone was to choose the automated option of \"making a purchase\" - - HOUZZ takes your money a lot easier than it addresses their horrible service. I was never able to speak to a manager. Nor would the customer service rep ever tell me the name of any manager. I finally was transferred to Allison a \"supervisor\" who offered NO satisfactory resolution. NOT even an acknowledgement of the terrible service. So I have a vanity in pieces in my entrance way, I have to wait for a carrier to come an pick it up and then only then will I get my refund.\nThe irony, the came vanity was on sale with Wayfair for $200 cheaper but I purchased it through HOUZZ because they said they could get it delivered quicker.\nM.

I really felt like they would be able to do like they assured me they would. I worked with Doug Taylor and he told me my credit file was nothing out of the ordinary and we should have no problems getting great results. It took some time but he was able to get some things removed, I was able to purchase a car, but soon after - several of the deleted collections reappeared on my reports to drop my scores even lower than they were when I hired them. I left a review on the BBB asking for a refund or partial and was told it was my fault for having high credit card balances. My CC's are paid off and have been for 2 months. My scores are still in the mid 400's. It's embarrassing. Lack of communication from Doug became very frustrating towards the end. I had to message them on Facebook to have him return my calls or emails. I know people have had great results with them. For whatever reason my deletions have reappeared and they wont help after 6 months. I offered to continue paying as long as it takes. At this point - they should refund my money. I've been pretty quiet hoping for someone to reach out and do the right thing but this is the first of many reviews. White Jacobs - do the right thing. My credit is complete and utter garbage. They will only respond with how they were able to get many deletions but don't address it when they reappear and drop your scores even further than before.

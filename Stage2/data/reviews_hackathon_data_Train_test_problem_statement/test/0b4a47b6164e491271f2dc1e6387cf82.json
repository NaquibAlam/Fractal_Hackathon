I actually spent 30 minutes on the phone with customer services to get a refund and get me out of the email list. Fabletics was charging me almost $50 a month to be part of their VIP program. PLEASE READ SMALL PRINT. I felt robbed.\nI payed almost $140 for just a pair of leggings and shirt. I should have received 2 for &24 on the leggings. I won't buy from them again. SAD.\nThis is my previous review: I had an issue with an order and it got resolved. I would have given a 5 star if someone had contacted me by email personally. I didn't know I got credit offered to me until I got an email today with pictures, it looked like the advertising for the day.\nThe issue got resolved and I'm very pleased. I will continue shopping at Fabletics and refer my friends.

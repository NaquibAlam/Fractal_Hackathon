Ruby my Bullmastiff seemed to enjoy it and it was deivered on time. However after a while she began to shed excessively and was constantly hungry even when I upped her feed. I looked deeper into this and I noticed quite a few other customers have had the same problem. Their customer service team didnt want to help nor did they seem interested for the wellbeing of my dog. So I switched immediately to a different brand (Guru cold pressed) it was more expensive but worth every penny. Within a week of switching Ruby's fur went back to normal her constent hunger is also now a thing of the past and she looks extremely healthy. If you love your pet and want the best then stay clear of Tails.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:26:18.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

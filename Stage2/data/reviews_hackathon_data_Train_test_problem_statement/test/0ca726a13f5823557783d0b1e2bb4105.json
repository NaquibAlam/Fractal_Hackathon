The probe had 0.4Ohms resistance in comparison to a very cheap one from another multimeter. So current measurement would be dangerous. I explained the problem and provided a picture that clearly showed the crooked cutout of the probe. The support wanted a video, which I provided, then the support wanted another explanation. After some messages they said this is was working as intended and there is nothing I can do.\nI was hoping they would resend me a probe, since the original one cost 8€ + shipping from the official distributor, but they did not. So I went for 2.50€ probes from Aliexpress out of my own pocket and after 4 weeks I finally had a working multimeter.\nI guess I am lucky I did not order an expensive phone or similar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T13:01:43.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

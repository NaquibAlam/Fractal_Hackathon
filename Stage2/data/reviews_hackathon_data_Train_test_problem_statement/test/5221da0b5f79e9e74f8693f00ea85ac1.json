The flat was a very bad and unsafe area (Drug, Prostitution etc), In the web site it said that it is in a safe area. My children were obliged to return to the appartement before 6 mp and not go out in any case. There was no way to know where was the appartement from SpotAHome.\nIt was a good think I only booked one month.\nAt the end of the month the landlord refused to give us back the deposit. I contacted the landlord and SpotAhome several times but Impossible (I can give a copy of all the emails). No answer from the landlord and SpotAhome said \"we can do nothing, it your business, not ours.\"\nI advise to not use spot_a_Home. They just take the money and In case of problems you have to deal with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:13:40.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

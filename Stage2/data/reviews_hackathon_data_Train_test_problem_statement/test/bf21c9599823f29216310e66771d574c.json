I booked a trip to Indonesia with them, but before my departure, I reserved an email saying that one of my flight has been canceled. So, I called them to check what we can do and they said that there is anything we can do!? I called my airline directly, they said that the flight was just transferred to another airline. But, because I purchased my tickets with FlightHub, I needed to change the flight with them. So I called again, they did nothing, they were not allowed to change anything, give me another flight or give me credit so I could buy an another ticket only for the cancelled flight, nothing. Now I am supposed to have a refund, but it takes 6 weeks before I get it and I am supposed to leave in 5 weeks. I lost a lot of time, to finally be disappointed and I need to check for a new flight. The customer care did help me at all and my next purchase will certainly not be with FlightHub.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:41:28.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was looking for a middleman for EMS and unfortunately came across Parcel Monkey through the Google search. Here is the list of my experiences: 1) printed label has very small font and not adjusted for US paper format, 2) pickup by \"courier\" was poorly arranged and turned out to be simply FedEx ground, 3) after a \"courier pickup\", I have not received a single clear confirmation message that my envelope left Newark's hub, and still have not received it until this day - a day of delivery. I was just getting gibberish apologies from different customer service people located in Philippines or some other distant places. 4) Weird tracking system of Parcel Monkey was showing dates from 1970s (!!!), I was told that this is a \"system generated info\", what an unprofessional comment, 5) for one whole mid-week day (!), both Parcel Monkey tracking and Live chat were down and not working. Also, their work hours are very limited.\nLesson learned: better pay a bot more money for reputable service than save and be worried and left without service.\nI would rate 1 start but because my parcel was finally delivered, I am reluctantly giving this company 2 stars...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:55:00.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

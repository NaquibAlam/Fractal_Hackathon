It arrived late, it arrived missing key design aspects of the order, the lapels were only half pressed, the buttons were inaccessible, the fabric was wrinkled and has a small tear. A cheap coat from Primark would have been made better! They forced me to pay for the return international shipping (to their obviously non-existent quality control department), despite the issue being their fault! I only paid to send it back out of my own pocket, because their 'customer service' promised to make a free re-make and donate the faulty coat.\nBear in mind I ordered the coat in December, It is now early March, 2 weeks after the new coat details were agreed (yes agreed / accepted!), I got a message requesting further payment before they make the coat. What the heck is this? Tailor4Less are liars, worst company I have ever dealt with. Refused to give me a contact number, refused to take responsibility, refused to give me a refund and now that I have done my part, they are going back on their word and bullying me to pay them more. Good lord, I have absolutely no confidence in their ability to create the coat as depicted on the sales website, yet alone in their word.\nUtterly terrible, stay a way, it is just not worth the months of wasted time and horror!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T02:15:57.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

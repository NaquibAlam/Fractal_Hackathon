When they arrived they were MUCH larger than listed and expected. I only half opened one and repacked it to original state. Didn't even open the other. After having to call customer service, and routed to two people I was told that they needed to contact the manufacturer to see what was possible and get back to me. I was later told that the manufacturer would not accept any returns and that my only option was to pay for shipping myself back to the RCWilley facility in Utah (BIG shipping bill!) RCwilley, customers buy products from YOU, not the manufacturer. So either come up with a decent return policy or pick better manufacturers! Consumers, don't buy anything unless you are 100% confident you won't need to return it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T09:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:38:54.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

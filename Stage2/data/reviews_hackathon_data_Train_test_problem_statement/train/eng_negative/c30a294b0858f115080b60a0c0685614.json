I waited for 6 days to receive my CFX, and waited another day for my kid to come over to help me. Sorry, I am an older medical MJ patient and not terribly tech savvy. The first time I used it, prior to even getting any benefit from it, I accidentally broke a piece off the mouthpiece, and after lots of examination and attempts, we realized it was impossible to put back on. So, I look for their contact and help, and learn they have no phone number, no longer have a chat, and only respond by email, which they warn hapless customers is backed up with high volume (and few or stoned employees?) I want this handled now, and don't want to wait. I posted on their FB page and pm-ed, and it said they respond in one day, but that might have been an older notification. I will wait until Monday afternoon to just contact my bank to reverse. No, I don't care about, \"discrete,\" and this is a legal state too.\nTheir, \"guarantee,\" says in later notes, that the customer must pay shipping both ways. As this is a heavy item, it is likely this is nearly as much as the cost of the product.\nDoes anyone know a reputable vape company, as I haven't found one? Is there a major, credible company that sells these products?

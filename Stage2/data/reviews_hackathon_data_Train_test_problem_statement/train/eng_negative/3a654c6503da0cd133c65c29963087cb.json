Blaming authorization holds and technology issues. They've even mentioned they've been hacked and drivers are losing their hard earned money.\nWhen I first signed up to drive for Lyft, they screwed up with my vehicle verification document and had me drive back to do another verification (very inconvenient to me).\nI drive for both Uber and Lyft. I've never had as many issues with the app or getting paid on time by Uber. Lyft in my opinion needs to sell out to Uber or a bigger company to smooth out these supposed glitches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:12:48.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

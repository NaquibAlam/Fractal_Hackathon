They take advantage of you, if you are not a native German speaker. Once they started deducting 40 Euros per month just like that. I couldn't find the reason and called them again and again around 10 times till I get someone whom I could speak with English. He also didn't know the reason and promised me to adjust that in the next bill. What he did was just changed the contract and paying 25 Euros instead of 40.I really wanted to sue them, but I don't know how. Someone please help me!\nI have never seen such a greedy mobile network ever. Please never opt for this network if you are not a German speaker.\nPS: They call occasionally for useless data and other offers. I told them, I have no interest in their offers, still they deducted around 7 Euros for two months. Now I cut the call whenever it is from Mobilcom debitel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:19:25.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

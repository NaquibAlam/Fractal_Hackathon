General manager does not care having spoken to her numerous times. The manager of the store promised to keep me updated and when the materials would arrive she failed to do this and I have had to phone her today and still have no answer\nThis is very unsatisfactory service and will not be using them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T21:51:58.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

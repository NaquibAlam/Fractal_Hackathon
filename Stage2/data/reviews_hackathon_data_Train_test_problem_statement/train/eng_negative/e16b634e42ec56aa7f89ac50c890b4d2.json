This time however I wanted to transfer Singapore dollars to NZ$. When I completed the deal the bank of deposit for the S$ was in New Zealand instead of the usual DBS in Singapore. I called up and was told that this was because of temporary problems with the account and was informed that any fees incurred would be paid by Ozforex. I transferred the money stating to my bank that fees would be covered by the payee however there was a still a S$30 charge for transferring the funds to a foreign account. When I forwarded this information to Ozforex I was told that these bank charges were to my account and would not be covered!\nI will therefore no longer use Ozforex for the transfer of S$ until I receive confirmation that your situation with DBS or another Singapore bank has been resolved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T07:12:14.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

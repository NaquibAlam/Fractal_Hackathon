The order to deliver in Portugal, did not leave Germany. According to DHL \"On the basis of your consignment number, we were able to conclude that the consignment was returned to the Amazon Logistics Center Pforzheim (Germany) on January 9.\". To this day I did not receive the order and TinyDeal did not return the money. They also did not contact DHL to find out where the order is and yet, to make matters worse, they did not responded to my last two messages.\nEven worse, they claim that \"As we informed you that we were informed that the order was delivered successfully.\"\nI have already asked them to show me proof of that, but they have not responded so far.\nI have several messages from DHL saying that the order was returned to the sender.\nThe first three purchases I made at TD went well.\nThe fourth purchase I did not receive the order, after two months they received it back and only returned me 95% of what I paid.\nUnfortunately I decided to make a new purchase and this is my greatest nightmare.\nThe post-sales service seems to only read part of the messages and most of the time it just answers \"\" Hope you could kindly wait a bit longer. \"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T08:13:21.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I bought a new bedroom set and they told me the bed frame wouldn't be in till march ok I'll deal with that. They deliver my Bedset and the dresser had a big chunk out of it and they put the screw through the frame of the mirror while attaching it to the long dresser I contacted the store they said how sorry they were and that was gonna be fixed and I would have new stuff by Tuesday Tuesday came didn't hear anything called up there and the person told me that there was nothing in the computer and that the manager has to approve it when I talk to them on Sunday after delivery that was already supposedly a manager involved . I tried to contact a manager again and they said they were all in a meeting and then went to corporate talk to them they get the situation figured out. Then I see that a good friend of mine bought the same bedaet a few days later and we were talking and he didn't have to wait for his bed frame to come in same size bed everything. I call the store and they tell me well the computer tells me this so that's what we have to go by. I don't i don't understand why I have to wait and extra month after purchasing the bedroom set but when someone else walks in there that I just happen to know they get the same thing at delivery makes no sense to me. They also told me I would be receiving gift cards through email after 48 hours and a week later still waiting. I'm waiting to yet again hear back from a manger..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:27:34.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

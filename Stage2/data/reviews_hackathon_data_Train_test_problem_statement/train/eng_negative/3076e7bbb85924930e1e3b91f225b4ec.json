I made sure I read the size chart to prevent any sort of return or refund. I get my items and they are made SOOOO SMALL!!! I couldn't even get them over my thighs and I'm not even a big/thick woman! The measurements couldn't possibly be accurate! When I visited the site again to find out how to do a return or exchange, I find out that there are NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES! Now I get the sanitary part when it comes to trying on things like swimsuits and undergarments, but had the measurements on the size chart been accurate, the items would not have been too small! So given that the swimsuits run small (yet they made no notation of it) and this clearly wasn't an error on my end, I decided to write them and ask if there were possibly an alternate solution (because come on, sometimes things do not fit and need to be returned or exchanged at the least. Not to mention the fact of WHO JUST WANTS TO TAKE THEIR MONEY AND THROW IT DOWN THE DRAIN?!) but I get an email which seems to be a duplicate of a section on the return policy when it comes to swimsuits, lingerie, etc stating that my request was denied! Did I not ask for an alternate solution??? Where was the reply to that? Oh let me guess, that WAS the answer to that question! Why of course it was! So I can spend my money with them, but they cannot work with me on ANYTHING regarding this order?? I might as well had taken my money and just flushed it down the toilet! Now I'm stuck with swimsuits I can't do anything with and basically a loss of over $100. Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!! Now they want me to enter my order number for this review so that they can \"identify me and make it easier to reply to my review\" I did that in the email I sent to them when I first wrote to them! Maybe they'll have another copy and paste for me again when I do. Ugh!

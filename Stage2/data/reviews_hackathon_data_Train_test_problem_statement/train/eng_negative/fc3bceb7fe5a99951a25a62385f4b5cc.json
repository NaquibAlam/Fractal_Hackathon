During a week I have tried to contact them by mail, by phone, via other booking companies etc. with absolutely no result. I am left now with 2 changed tickets, which I cannot make any use of, since it is totally impossible to get in touch with Travelgenio. Right now my phone is cutting the line for the 4th time after having waited up to several minutes. Never ever Travelgenio again!!!\nI DID contact the airlines. They told me to contact you and DID NOT offer any alternatives. I have now contacted you by mail and am waiting for you to cancel the tickets and pay me back my money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:27:41.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

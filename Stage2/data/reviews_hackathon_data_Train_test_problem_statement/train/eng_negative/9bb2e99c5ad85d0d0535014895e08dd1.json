On 2/1. Between the order and cancellation time [8 min apart]\n2/4 2:17 - I msg motoquipe on ebay requesting an explanation.\n2/8 - Package delivered but not left with me because no one was home to sign.\n2/14 - I drive to post office and pick up package. Still no word from Motoquipe.\n2/15 - I track package and find that it was shipped 2/3, two full days after my (two) cancellation requests. So they ignored the cancellation request as well as my request for explanation, just to make the $100 or so off the seat covers.\nBuyer beware; they are out for themselves and do not have a concern for customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:30:06.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A couple weeks later my controller was still being painted. So i emailed them and got a very sarcastic rude response. another week goes by and my controller still is not ready. i email them again. they tell me that my controller will be shipped at noon on the day i email them. a few more days go by and my controller still didnt ship. they gave me some lame excuse that they had to patch the mod because of an update for infinite warfare. they gave me the option to either leave it and send it or fix the mod. i dont play infinite warfare so i didnt care. yet they still did not send it. finally i got a call a few days later telling me they were sending it finally. i get the controller and its not even what i ordered. i wanted a matte finish but received a gloss one. they told me after i emailed them again that because i got a splatter on it that they had to put a gloss finish over it to stop it from coming off. i wouldnt mind if i was informed prior but nope. they dont care about the customers. so in all i waited over a month to get my controller back and to get the controller i ordered, the controller was NOT what i ordered, and they could not care less that i am unhappy with their product. Terrible service, terrible company, terrible controller. Just buy the mod pack from wal-mart. its better and has all the same features minus the custom controller that they will make wrong anyway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:41:06.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

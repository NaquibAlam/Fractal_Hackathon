The very next morning, I called my doctor to send the RX for exactly what I had ordered. I even received an email from health warehouse about how they had received the RX that day. I go to my order tracking and it still says the order was just placed 3, almost 4, days later. It also doesn't show that RX that they said they had received so I can tell if anything on it was wrong. I sent a message to them more than 24 hours ago and haven't received anything back. It worries me that I have no idea what the problem is or if I will ever receive my order when this is a medication I take everyday and will be without it now. And they charged my account the very second I placed my order even without the RX, so I am out that money for who knows how long without what I ordered.

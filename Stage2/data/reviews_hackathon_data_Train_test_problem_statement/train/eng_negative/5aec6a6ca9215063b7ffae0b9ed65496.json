One of my pieces of furniture was badly damaged in a spot that was very visible to the drivers who were screwing on the legs when it arrived, but they chose to not tell me about the damage and I did not see it until after they left. Several of the throw pillows were also damaged. I then went back to the store to return the furniture. They were very apologetic and agreed to a full refund and that I would get a zero balance statement because I had financed, but that I did not need anything in writing. I considered the issue closed. When I got the credit card bill today, however, it included a $99.98 balance for shipping. This was very disappointing as I was told that I was being given a \"full refund.\" I paid the bill so I can close out the Gardner-White credit card and consider this awful experience complete. When your customer service team agreed to a refund, I said that I would give Gardner-White another chance in the future. I don't believe that will be the case anymore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:14:41.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

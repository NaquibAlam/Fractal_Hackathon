The tickets were later changed from Economy Class Málag-Paris to BUSINESS CLASS Málaga-New York with my acceptance of the attached penalty.\nUnfortunately I had to change my travel plan again and wanted to cancel the tickets according to Air Europa’s cancellation policy for Business Class tickets which are:\nCancellations allowed up to 3 days before departure with a penalty of 200€ (or 250$) per passenger providing the same booking class is available. If the change results in a higher booking class the difference in fare must be paid. Administration fees not included.\n12 weeks before the scheduled flight I made a phone call to AE and requested a cancellation but was told, that my tickets was not refundable as the tickets were changed from Economy Class tickets to Business Class tickets and that the first ticket is determining the subsequent status for the final ticket despite the final ticket has a higher status ..!! In other words: Pay for Business Class tickets but stay on economy status!\nNever again !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T22:49:38.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A good amount of options to choose from, supposedly always on time..\nI ordered from their website for 11:30am the next day. Nothing shows up. I called their support team and they said they would get back to me. 15 minutes later they call back and say the restaurant didn't see the order? Didn't offer any other options other than they can drop something off in 45 minutes? I work for a company that operates via billable hours and we only have from 12-1 pm. I would have thought that since the restaurant is on your platform you would have a way of making sure restaurants are confirmed. Or just being responsive if they couldn't do the order. That's how businesses run, right?\nLesson learned- I'll stick with legitimate businesses that are known for their\nprofessionalism.

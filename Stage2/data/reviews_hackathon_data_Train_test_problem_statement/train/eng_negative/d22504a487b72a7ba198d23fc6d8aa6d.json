When I rang, the automated response encouraged that I contact online instead.\nI also rang twice last week to confirm that I would only be free from 1:30pm for the installation to take place. I got confirmation via text to say that they would arrive after 1 so instead of ringing a third time, I re-arranged things in work to allow me to get home for 1pm just in case.\nThe installer arrived at 12, luckily my housemate was at home but that meant that he had to wait in the house for half an hour while the installation took place. I spoke to the installer on the phone and he said he was never informed that I wouldn't be available until 1pm. He himself was very polite and this is not a complaint about him but about the management behind the scenes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:27:17.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

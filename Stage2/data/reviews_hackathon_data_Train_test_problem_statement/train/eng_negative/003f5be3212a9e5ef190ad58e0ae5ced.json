Well that did not happen. When i realized the shoes would not arrive in time I attempted to cancel my order. I was told by the customer service rep that since they drop ship directly from the manufacturer they would not be able to cancel the order. Because I knew all about the pair shoes I did not need to read the details and the description of the shoes. Nowhere on the main order screen did it say they were drop shipped from Altra... when I brought this to the customer service reps attention she agreed that this was almost bait and switch. Roadrunner Sports needs to clearly label on the main order screen that the products that are drop shipped are indeed drop ship and not directly from themselves. Thank God for Altra as I contacted them immediately and they ensured that a pair of shoes would arrive in time. However this did cost me an additional pair of shoes as a separate order directly from them. When I received the pair of shoes from Road Runner Sports I decided to exchange them. Using their return policy I sent the shoes out Friday December 30th. When I discovered that Roadrunner had receive them and had had them for a few days I again called customer service. It was then I was told I would not be getting an exchange pair of shoes because I had used PayPal and that I would be getting a credit. Again no where on the immediate page does it state that if you use a PayPal account and need to do an exchange they would not on an exchange they would only credit up Paypal account. Even as I talk to the customer service representative I offered to pay the difference which I believe was about $10 to have the shoes exchanged and they would not be able to do that. Long story short as of January 24th I still have not received my credit. Their website and customer service informs me it can take up to 14 business days to do this credit. This seems quite far-fetched as when I paid for the merchandise it was immediately deducted from my credit card. I do not give poor ratings two companies unless they deserve it and in this situation this company deserves this one star rating. The customer service Representatives that I talk to we're very indifferent to my situation and offered me absolutely no alternative. Do yourself a favor and never order shoes from this company. At least in this situation my ordering experience through Ultra directly was incredibly favorable. They're customer service went above and beyond when I contacted them just three days before Christmas I had the shoes on Christmas Eve and they provided a pair of compression socks as compensation. That was a $40 set of socks. And they matched roadrunners price. Roadrunner Sports will never received my business again and I will do everything I can to discourage anyone from ordering from them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T11:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:25:15.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

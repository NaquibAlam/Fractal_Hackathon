This would allow me to sit next to a colleague and plan for the business trip ahead. At no point in the booking process was I able to select my seat so presumed I would be able to do this after making payment...not the case.\nI telephoned customer support who advised that there is no option to select your seat when making an online booking and that I now had 3 options; speak to the train manager on the day, ask another passenger to move or pay an extra €47 to change my seat...you are joking...!!!\nIt's a good job the customer support lady who answered the phone was very friendly and polite otherwise I would have vented all my frustration. You don't make their jobs easy.\nOne would think it common sense the functionality to select a seat would be built in to the online booking process, but no. So if you want to reserve a seat book your ticket over the phone...!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:02:13.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Of course it is cheaper to do so but if the book is damaged during shipping there is no way to know that, it could be that it was in that condition before but the company can claim otherwise. I would never buy from these people again due to the shipping practises.\nA positive note, the book was what I ordered.\nA second negative is that they say 7-14 days but when asked about the location of the book they explained that it is 7-14 business days excluding weekends and holidays which normally would be fine but should be up front not asked about. In fact I still do not understand why something sent inside the USA would take nearly 3 weeks to arrive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:12:03.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

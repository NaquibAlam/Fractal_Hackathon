I recently set up an Ebay account and linked my PayPal account to it for payments. I sold a SatNav on Ebay for £80, the payment worked fine at first and there were no problems. About a month later I got an email from PayPal saying the £80 has been taken back out of my account and returned to the customer who bought the SatNav because I \"didn't sign up for a PayPal account\"?!?!? There's never been a problem with Paypal taking my money to buy things but as soon as I get money put in it it takes it out?! All PayPal has done to help me is tell me I'll have to contact the buyer myself and work something out between us, considering this is someone I've never met and she's just got a free SatNav I won't be surprised if she just ignores my email. Never using PayPal again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T23:15:09.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I must have asked nearly a dozen times if they would be picking us up, they just kept telling me it was my fault - which it clearly was not.\nI have given them several opportunities to reimburse our additional costs/refund us which they have refused\nI could and would never trust this company, I would rather pay a little more for a reliable company and if you have children and need child seats then this is probably an important consideration for you.\nHad they have come back for us I would not even post this, mistakes do happen, it is how you deal with them that makes the difference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T11:58:52.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

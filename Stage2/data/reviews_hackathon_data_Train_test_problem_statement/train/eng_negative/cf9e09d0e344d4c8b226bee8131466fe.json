On the other hand there was a huge problem with the water. It was very cloudy and very smelly. I guess of sulfur. The faucets would spray out in a sputtering motion and the pressure was off. We let it run for Almost 30 minutes on 2 separate occasions, one before the plumber came and once after, and after it ran you could see the dirt in the color of the water (light brown) and by the dirt visible in the sink/tub. The bathroom water barely got warm. So showering/bathing was annoying. The shower with the jacuzzi tub would spray out so bad when the jets were on that it soaked the whole bathroom. Then the button got stuck to where it kept spraying and we had to use a knife to pry it back out to shut off the jets. The shower upstairs either sprayed in a sputter motion or barley let any water out. The kitchen sink was a toss up. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it sprayed and sputtered out. You could smell the rotten egg smell anytime the water was on. We had to buy drinking water. They were doing work on the cabin next to us. And in the kitchen there were exposed wires in an unfinished outlet. But other than that it was very pretty. Our family enjoyed the beauty of it. And the beds were soft. But the water was a huge issue so it gets 2 stars. And one lamp upstairs was missing a light bulb. It was beautiful but needs work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T13:15:19.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Sales associate would not get up from the desk and seemed to be uninterested in keeping my business. Only said that he had nothing that he could rent to me. So, I went to another Public Storage who was very helpful in obtaining my business. Since this was in another town and was a new account under my spouse, we did the internet special (1st month 50% off). We were then told that we did not qualify since my spouse had an account at another facility that I was the emergency contact on. Feel that I was taken advantage of because it was a different store and the internet pricing was not honored.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:43:24.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

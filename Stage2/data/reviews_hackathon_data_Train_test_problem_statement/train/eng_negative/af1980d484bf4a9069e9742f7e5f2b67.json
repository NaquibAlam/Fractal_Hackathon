CHECK THE BBB 1306 COMPLAINTS FILED AGAINST THEM. I placed an order on 2/9 with them (without any research, thought I was ordering from a local florist)....on 2/10 they called me, sent me an URGENT text, and an email to contact them about my order. After trying to deal with someone who could not communicate clearly and had no clue what she was doing i cancelled my order. They kept trying to offer me a discount but I told them at least 4 times to just cancel. Once they confirmed verbally that they cancelled and told me I'd get a confirmation in an email from their supervisor I placed another order with a competitor....Ava's apparently never cancelled the order but delivered it and now refuses to refund me because the flowers were delivered and they showed no cancellation on my order. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT NO ONE DO BUSINESS WITH THEM.

I also sell on a similarly named auction web site on which I have enjoyed remarkable success over many years (in fact, so much success that I make my living trading on this alternative site) so I find it hard to believe that the fault of my miserable level of sales on eBid lies with me.\nI see from my listings that there are many, many views of my items for sale but these very rarely translate into actual sales. I've asked the eBid community and eBid itself for their insights on this but no one seems to have any real understanding as to why this is so. One thing I have found is that despite the numerous views my listings attract, hardly anyone I speak to has heard of eBid and I think this needs to be addressed by those in charge of the site. It strikes me as odd that despite such low public awareness of the site within a very short time a new listing that I place will gather tens of views, sometimes one hundred or more. It feels as though something is not right here and I would like to know how eBid actually calculates 'hits' for listings.\nAnother reason for my poor sales could be the eBid website itself. For me, it is not so easy to navigate as I would like and feels cluttered at times. In addition, its appearance is drab and not half as appealing as the former purple and green format that was once used.\nI try to encourage all my customers from other sources to visit eBid but with only very limited sales success. Something is putting them off and eBid need to engage with this to find out what that might be.\nOn balance eBid is a great idea. I would switch to it permanently if I could be sure of the volume of sales that I achieve elsewhere but until the site becomes more well known I wouldn't dare take the risk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T10:19:49.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

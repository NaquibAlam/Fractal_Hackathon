I am embarrassed to see the photos, she took to show me the flowers she received. I ordered a large (extra Â£10) Rose & Lilly Hand Tied bouquet of flowers created by Melanie. I would have liked to attach photos to show people what she received. It was poorly constructed bouquet. I thought it will look at good as the photo however it was far from it.\nShe did not receive a large bouquet but a small to medium size one, she further told me, she saw that some of the roses have begun wilting already. I am astonished with the high reviews of this company. When they delivered such poor service. I have contacted them three times regarding this order, I emailed twice to customer advisor Darren Hurst to discuss what she received. I still have not receive a reply regarding this order. I put two enquires through on to their site and still no response.\nI would have liked to speak to them before posting this review however there has not been a response and left me no choice.

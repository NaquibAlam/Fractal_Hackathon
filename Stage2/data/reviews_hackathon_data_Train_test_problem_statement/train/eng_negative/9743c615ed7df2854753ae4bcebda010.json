That's when the problems began.\nTheir return policy states that my order would need an RMA number, which wasn't listed anywhere on my packaging slip. I called customer service and got the proper form (it was nice to speak to a person, wasn't on hold for too long, very helpful, etc).\nI get the form, fill it out, return it, wait. A week later I receive notice that my return package has been delivered to their warehouse. I waited a week, didn't receive my refund. Since then I've called customer service three times, each time being told that a \"reminder\" had been sent to some department and that I would receive my money in 24-48 hours. After going through this three times, I finally called accounting, who told me that my order was still \"under review\", but that they would go ahead and approve it, and that I would get my money in 24-48 hours.\nI still haven't gotten my refund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:44:31.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

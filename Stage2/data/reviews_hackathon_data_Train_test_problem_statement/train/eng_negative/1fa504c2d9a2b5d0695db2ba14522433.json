When I bought the tickets from Argentina to Peru, when I was typing the name, it was no enough space to put the complete name, so I call Travelginio, the lady that answered the phone told me, don't worry, buy the tickets then call us again and we will fix the name. I trusted what she said. I bought the ticket then I call back, and another lady said, no problem I can fix it, you just have to paid 150.00 dollars more, because I need to do another reservation. At the end, after many minutes arguing she said, I give you 2 options, or pay the difference or I cancel the ticket, so I decided to cancel the ticket. She refused to give me a confirmation of the cancelation and let me talk with the manager. Even though the ticket was canceled immediately, they charge me for the ticket. Then my nightmare started, I called many times to the numbers in New York but nobody did nothing until I contacted the main office in Spain. I need to say the Customer service in Spain, was very helpful but it took 3 months to have my money back, meanwhile I was paying interest for the money in my credit card.\nI really think that Travelginio needs to fix their web page, that is no right not to be able to write your name, they can't limit the space because there are some names very long and when you travel your name needs to be spell exactly that appear in the passport and the other thing is that the personal that is in customer service needs to be well trained and not lie to the customer. But I am great full that Travelginio gave me my money back. Thanks Customer service from Spain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:40:16.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

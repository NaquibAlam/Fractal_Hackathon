The purchase went through smoothly (5 stars!), with \"email delivery within minutes\" promised. But an hour later, the tickets had still not been emailed (1 star). The website was no help at all (0 stars), and the feedback form only produced an automated response (1 star). Hidden deep within the website, thankfully found by Google's bots, was their call centre number 1300 651 607. Spoke to a human being and they sent my tickets 10 minutes before the show! Thankfully the PDF barcode could be scanned from my mobile phone screen. The anxiety of waiting for an email response was more exciting than the show itself.\nSummary: CALL THEM AT 1300 651 607.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T17:01:17.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

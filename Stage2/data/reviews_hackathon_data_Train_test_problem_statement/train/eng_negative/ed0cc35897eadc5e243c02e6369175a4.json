I could write a book but I will attempt to sum it up.\nCame in with a tape measure because the space we needed furniture was tough to get to. We were told size didn't matter because you had a service where the furniture could be disassembled - the sales associate raved about the service and said it would be done at delivery. We picked a living room set - knowing it was too big and needed disassembly 5300$ worth of furniture. Delivery came - couldn't get the coach in the basement -said they didn't disassemble it was a different department and there was a charge.\nMade arrangements for the disassemble - got a call several days later saying they couldn't do it. Over 2 weeks went back and forth about what to do with the set. Finally made a decision - the order had to be changed so many times we were locked out of financing. Had to go over to the store and handle that. All I got off was 50$ for all of the trouble - hours on the phone - and finally the furniture being delivered over 2 weeks later.\nI thought I would at least get the furniture insurance on the house for all of the trouble. I did deal with an assistant manager once the problems came up. Very frustrating - always went to Art Van. First purchase through Gardner-White.\nOnly suggestion I can make is training the sale people better - they need to tell the customer from the beginning there is a cost to disassembly and know which furniture can or can't be disassembled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:58:29.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

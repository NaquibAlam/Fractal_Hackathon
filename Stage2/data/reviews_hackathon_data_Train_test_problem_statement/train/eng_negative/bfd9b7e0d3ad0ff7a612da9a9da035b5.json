The first time they charged my account and never sent me the flight itinerary/confirmation, so I had to go through my bank to get the money back. Just tried to book another flight, and got an e-mail that I need to wait for a confirmation. I am now just 100% sure the same has happened with this unprofessional company. How is it even possible that they still excist. Better to pay extra and get your tickets somewhere else.\nEdit:\nEnquiry solved fast through Facebook- thank you very much Jenny.\nJust hope this can be changed in the future so issues can be solved without having to post a negative review first, as my first time experiencing this without posting a review nothing happened in a week, until my bank claimed the money back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:27:49.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

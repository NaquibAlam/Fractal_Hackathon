Deductible for the iPhone which is $286 and deductible for a loaner phone $99 were charged to my account. Last time I spoke to Sean Hansen was sometime in December. After leaving bunch of emails and calls, I never heard back from Sean. Then Angelo was my next contact with Essuranty. He said he is going to take care of my claim and make sure everything is on track sometime around early January. After that I made so many calls and emails to essuranty but never received any response. I am very disappointed and frustrated.

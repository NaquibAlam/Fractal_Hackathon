Frankly, id just go elsewhere, and not last minute about doing it either. Booked a week ago, money taken before id even confirmed (or so it felt) and out comes the 'your booking isn't confirmed yet, but should be within 48hrs' spiel which was obviously an afterthought as if to say \"hey we might be robbing you to the point of disappointment coz you wont be able to go on holiday, and your refund (if they bother) will leave you unable to do anything, even last minute.\nCall centres are overseas and might as well be entirely robotic as a conversation isn't even possible. the \"customer care team\" pauses for thought after every sentence, clearly finding the appropriate response from a sheet of preempted phrases. When they cant understand the problem they simply put you on hold, to pick up two minute or more later and tell you that it has been passed to another team with absolutely ZERO explanation as to what is happening with your booking. Last minute employee program, no training whatsoever.\nIn summary.

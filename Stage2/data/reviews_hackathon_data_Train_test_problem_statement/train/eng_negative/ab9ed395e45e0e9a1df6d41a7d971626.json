Time and time again, I've found myself having to contact the customer support staff online to get help with the Marvin website.\nRegular problems with the website consist of:\n- problems with the website not recognising or saving my address properly (no matter how often I correct it and despite having had orders successfully delivered on a previous date). A very simple solution would be to change the address line to have people input their Eircode (assuming you also get your mapping on your website corrected) !\n- the website losing restaurants which were available to deliver to my address, then suddenly are not (despite me having earned loyalty credits from them and being able to get them to deliver if I order directly from them, rather than via Marvin.ie). Sometimes the staff on the online chat can re-instate the restaurants while I wait, other times they cannot but the restaurants mysteriously reappear on my list of options a few days later.\nThe website is unreliable and while the customer service team who work the online chat feature are very good and clearly do all they can to deal with the ongoing issues, there's a limit to what they can do when the technology simply lets them down.\nI've also asked the people on the live chat on more than one occasion to have a more senior staff member at Marvin call me the next day to speak about the problem, but no one ever calls me !\nEvery time I try the service and get a successful experience, it gives me a little confidence to stick with Marvin in the hope that perhaps they've finally fixed their dodgy website, but then a couple of orders later and we're back to the same old problems. At this stage, I think one more website problem is all it's going to take for me to close my Marvin account.\nCoincidentely, I used the service last night having not used it for a few weeks and the website worked fine - however having been led to believe that the delivery would take something like 30 or 35 minutes, it turned up after around 70 minutes. There was no phone call to explain that they were going to be delayed and no apology when they did finally arrive (I guess the driver was worn out having had to drive a little under 2 miles to bring me my food) !\nThe Marvin website should show the time for delivery before a customer is compelled to pay, so that the customer then has the option not to proceed if the delivery period is too long. Also, there should be an automatic 50% cash refund applied for the customer, when the restaurant is more than 15 minutes later than the time indicated for delivery (that might get the restaurants to shape up a bit !).\nFor the record, I don't live on Mars or in the most remote part of Ireland, I actually live about 6-7 miles from Dublin's GPO, in a house in a cul-de-sac that was constructed over 35 years ago so can easily be found on various maps etc.\nNeedless to say I'm happy to stand over all that I've said here and your customer records should support all that I've said.\nGarrett", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:52:00.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

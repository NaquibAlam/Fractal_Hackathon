At the beginning of the call, he asked how long I anticipated needing the system. I told him that I was working with my lawyer to have my suspension lifted early, so I would need the system for anywhere between one and eleven months (11 months being the full suspension term. Then, at the end of the call when he was reviewing the details he said I was set up for a 12 month lease which I questioned and reminded him that I may not need it that long. He then replied \"well you would be the first person ever to have a suspension shortened\" implying that he hear what I said but set me up for 12 months anyway based upon his opinion of how my case would be resolved. He also mentioned that there would be a potential $50 fee for missing or being late for a calibration appointment and later I took it upon myself to ask about the initial installation appointment, which he then said was also subject to the $50 fee. However, this was not disclosed on the front end, and when setting the initial appointment he just said 'well they open at 8am so you can bring it in the night before or after 8am' without telling me it was a firm apt time. Very unprofessional.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T23:17:49.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

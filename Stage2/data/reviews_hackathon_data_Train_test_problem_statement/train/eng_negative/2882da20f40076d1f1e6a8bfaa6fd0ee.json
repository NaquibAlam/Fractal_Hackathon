My Calls have been dropped, I have held for one plus hours, my service has been disconnected my bill was doubled,....I can keep going. I have been in the retail business for 40+ years, I own a business also, which has suffered because of no internet, and I have never been treated worse than I have from your company. If I treated people as you do I would be living on the streets. I pay my bill, I get extra services, and I can't get anyone to help me when I call. If one out of 10 people feel this way you have a lot of issues. I know 3. What does that tell you???\nYou send me new boxes and it takes an hour on hold to get one hooked up and then they disconnect me. Never call me back. This is really unacceptable behavior.\nI can't begin to express my disappointment since you took over from Verizon. I was hoping for something better and it gets worse everyday.\nGood luck in the business. I believe in my area if things don't change, most will go to Comcast. I actually know a tech that was with Verizon an came to you. I will vent this to him tomorrow. I know I'm just a pion in your world, but figured I'd let you know, 2 weeks in a row you have ruined my week. Guess my money can't buy cable and internet service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:43:04.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Upon arrival, the driver (Marlene) called- and that was about the only thing she got correct. I asked her to confirm her location per the instructions (the complex I live in occupies an entire city block) and she verified she was at the right place. Walked down 3 flights of stairs- she's not there. Walked back up to get my phone, called again to CONFIRM where she was supposed to be. After constantly interrupting me during this exchange, and after finally getting her to listen, she said she would be right there. After waiting outside for over 10 minutes- again- no show. I called a THIRD TIME only to get more interruptions and attitude. She said she would refer this to her dispatcher- which was actually a relief- I might actually get to talk to someone who can LISTEN, after which I hung up and contacted Foodler. When I DID get my food I was met with snarky remarks and smirks from the driver (Marlene).\nI truly hope the dispatcher I spoke with takes action with Marlene. She exhibited some of the WORST customer service I have experienced in a very long time", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T08:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:05:31.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

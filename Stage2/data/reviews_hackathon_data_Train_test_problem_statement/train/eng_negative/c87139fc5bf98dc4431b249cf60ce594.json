Wouldn't do it again. I declined on additional insurance as I have forever. Someone scraped the back bumper of the rental car while it was parked within 2 hours of me renting it. They were deep enough scrapes in the fiberglass bumper on one corner that they were noticeable. I took it to a local body shop that had great yelp reviews before I brought it back to them. They hemmed and hawed, had me turn the car in so they could evaluate it; I had to make follow-up calls to keep things moving. Then they came back $900 over what the body shop had estimated. I gave both Quote: s to my insurance company. They then gave my insurance company all sorts of trouble and stretched the whole thing out for months. Bottomline: they are disorganized as a company and they aren't ethical in their dealings. They tried to make a lot of money off of me and my insurance company. I would not rent from them ever again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T09:58:09.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They are also reported to be a “Medium” fit frame… there is NO WAY these are a medium. My husband has a large head according to every optician we’ve ever talked to and these are HUGE on him. They won’t even stay on his face. They also arrived very dirty and slightly bent. This is my fist time ordering from this company and I was shocked and disappointed to read the return policy of NO REFUND on lenses AND a 20% restocking fee on the frame!? I’ve ordered from 2 other online companies before, both of whom refunded 100% of my order when needed. So on a $208 order I would only receive a refund of $100. When I contacted the company to voice my feelings, I was basically told too bad \"that is the policy.\" Will never order from here again. If I can’t trust the sizing, I have to at least trust the company to make me whole when I am dissatisfied with the product. I don’t know how they can claim to have a 100% satisfaction guarantee with such awful return policies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:06:35.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

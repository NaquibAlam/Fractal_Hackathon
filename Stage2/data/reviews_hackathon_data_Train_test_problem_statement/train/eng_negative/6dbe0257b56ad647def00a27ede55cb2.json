At no time did your agent respond in ways that we're clear, timely or made sense. If you think so (based on the email interactions) I understand exactly why your service is so bad.\nI was referred to them by my CPA. The person at the CPA was so appalled by my treatment by Ana at Blumberg Excelsior that she took over the remainder of the interaction and finished getting what should have been 2 days of work but instead took 3 weeks. They repeatedly ignored my emails and when they did respond, they did so in ways that made no sense or ignored information I had provided. Completely incompetent and dismal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:49:24.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

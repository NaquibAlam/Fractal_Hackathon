Was a very happy customer in the early years - web site worked and great support. In recent years using support has become a bit of a wearing experience. Web hosting would be changed and break my site and I'd have to spend a while convincing support that it was them who broke it.\nI thought upgrading to VPS might improve the situation but migration of my existing web site has been a bit of a farce with unanswered queries and the impression I get from support doesn't make me think that they're owning my problem. It seems to be a bit of - it works for us so it must be my problem.\nLooks like I'll be migrating it myself when I get the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:22:26.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

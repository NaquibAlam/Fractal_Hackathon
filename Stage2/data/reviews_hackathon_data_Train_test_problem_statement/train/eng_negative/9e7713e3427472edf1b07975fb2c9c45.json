We booked in January for August of the same year....if they want to reserve the amount on the credit card, are they planning of keeping it reserved for 7 months?\nI would honestly prefer to have the full amount debited on booking and eventually refunded in case of a cancellation.\nInsurance coverage is also not clear. I found, just after being contacted from a rental cars sales representative, that the full coverage I had bought at the time of the reservation was offered from rental cars and not from the renting company. Even if the price offered was very convenient, the claim process in the event of an accident was nowhere specified at the time of reservation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:37:16.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

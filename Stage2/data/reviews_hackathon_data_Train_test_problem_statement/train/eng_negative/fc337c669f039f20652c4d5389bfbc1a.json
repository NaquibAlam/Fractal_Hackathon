After 2/3 calls, issue is still not resolved and I don't know whether to trust Opodo as we still don't have confirmation of our flights. Totally unacceptable and inadequate customer service!!!\nHad to phone again today as confirmation still had not come through, after about the 5th call! No satisfaction whatsoever. My husband called Virgin who informed him that there was a flight missing from our booking. We are travelling to Tampa from Manchester with 1 stop. If this was not rectified we would have been without a return flight from Tampa to Atlanta. The very obliging Virgin operator contacted Opodo to inform them of their mistake and said she was holding on the line until Opodo sorted out the whole debacle!! She agreed that Opodo has dealt with us in an extremely horrendous manner. In fact she said that Opodo had not ticketed us and we could have arrived at the airport with no flights!!\nWe at last have 3 confirmations by email, but I'm still worried that we could arrive at the airport with no flights!!\nWe have been loyal customers and have used Opodo on many occasions, indeed we are flying to the USA in April and July, having booked flights through Opodo.\nI'm not happy about sharing my booking reference on here as I'm not sure how public this is.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T19:43:59.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

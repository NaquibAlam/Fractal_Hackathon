I dutifully checked her out to be sure she was not a telephone fraudster. After I was satisfied that Jamie was/Is? legitimate, I discussed my medigap information with her and she forwarded Quote: s to me. She then called me in follow up and I had decided to not change my plans. She accepted that. She was polite and very nice to work with, and told me to call back if I had further questions.\nSo I get another question and try to make contact with Jamie only to be told she is \"no longer with this department.\" Now I am suppose to talk with someone else. This all sounds very fishy and as a result I no longer trust GoMedigap.\nNow I am not saying Jamie Wiley is (or was or whatever) dishonest. She sounded very legitimate and knowledgable. But how can I trust GoMedigap when I am passed off from sales person to sales person.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:25:49.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

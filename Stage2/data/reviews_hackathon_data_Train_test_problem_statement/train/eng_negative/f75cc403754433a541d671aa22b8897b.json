To our surprise they had taken us to another depot. Which as tourists we didn't know where we were, or where we were meant to be (we gave them our names and said we were collecting a car that we had booked)\nAs we arrived at the depot we were mucked around by one of your staff who didn't listen to what we were saying and confused us, made us pay for an extra days rental before another guy stepped in and corrected her and refunded us the money we didn't need to pay.\nWe then were given the keys and GPS and taken out to the car. I then asked the man if he could help us install the GPS which he replied you are going to have to figure it out for yourself at some stage.\nOverall experience with the car was fine.. The customer service on the other hand was beyond terrible. Not the way we wanted to start our travels in NZ.\nWe were made to feel stupid and more of a hassle than a customer who is supporting this business.\nAll we got from this experience was rude comments like 'well you've really bugged this up', 'you are going to have to figure this out for yourself at some stage'. And to be spoken to rudely and abruptly and not listened to.\nI had only head great things about NZ and recommended your car rental by several people before choosing to book with you. I guess I just feel very disappointed by the experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:11:37.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I informed them (Marianna and Erin Murphy) via email that the owner of the company had to approve the pre-production sew out they sent me. I also let them know that the owner was on vacation, and that it would take some time for him to see the logo. And I told them that I would contact them when he came back and approves/disapproves the sew out. Well, they still sent me an email everyday about approval, the same email, asking the same thing. They even researched our employee's email, and Erin Murphy sent her an email asking for me and the owner. She also asked her if she can send her the logo. I guess they wanted her to approve the logo. First of all the employee has no authorization to approve such things. Second, they took this too far, by finding out our employee's email and contacting her regarding things that only the owner is authorized to do. I do not understand why they could not wait if I had already informed them about the owner not being available. The quality of the products is great. But these people are way too pushy and want to make a sale fast, and it seems like the customer is not allowed to take some time to approve the sew out. They want approval immediately and if they don't get it, they will contact you everyday, and it does not matter if you say you will contact them when you have an answer. Both the quality of the products and customer service is important for us. I will not be making any future purchases from this place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:53:53.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

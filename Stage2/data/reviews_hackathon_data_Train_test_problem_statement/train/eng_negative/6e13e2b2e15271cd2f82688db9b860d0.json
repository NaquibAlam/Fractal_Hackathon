I get one call every month or two. Maybe. When I do get a call, people don't want to meet or pursue anything. They just want to shop, tire kick, use you as a spring board for looking for cheaper prices....and they certainly don't book you if they have to pay their referral fee. Vendors are better off doing facebook booster ads. Very cheap and brings me several dozen hits per day. It's tageted at people that want my service. Gigsalad does not allow you to have any outside contact with potential clients. Everything has to be done through their website. Which sounds great but when you or the client want to ask a simple question in a back-and-forth exchange, it has to go through their website for Gigsalad to review. What a colossal waste of time and energy and dictatorship.. On top of that, they send you reminders of how much money you DID NOT make in the previous month...which tells me that this service does not work or pay. Therefore I do not pay for a subscription. After several months of trial, It has proven useless to me.\nBrides are better off going to Ontario Wedding Swap on facebook. Way more free referrals...with references...ask a question, get a 100 answers fast and easily from other brides and vendors in your area.

Everything goes well; and requests are done on a quite effective manner... until something went wrong.\nWhen came the time to send my shipments; most of the packs left their warehouse; and tracking got updated... except for one pack. I have followed their process; and raise a ticket to understand what was happening. As I received no answer, I contacted their online support to get more information.\nGood point: their online support is effective; and people can be spoken to relatively fast. Bad point: they're not helpful, as they depend on their local staff within warehouses to handle requests... and it seems that those local staff have no willingness to answer.\nI finally got my pack; the tracking number was incorrect. However, this makes me cautious when dealing with such people - if my pack were really lost, I wonder how they would have reacted. Not mentioning that they have managed to make one mistake out of ten packs , i.e. 10% of failure on my case. Bad luck? Does not seem so when reading all other reviews.\nI won't use them again for shipping tens of thousands of USD worth of items, to be honest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:08:10.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

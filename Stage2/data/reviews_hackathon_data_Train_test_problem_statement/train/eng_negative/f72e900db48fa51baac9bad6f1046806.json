The bra was 49+ change, but it was shown as 29.+ change. I only agreed to buy that bra, as shown, at the 29. price. As far as 19.99 for the cosmetic bag, I thought that was a gift with purchase. I don't even really need that. So why do I have to pay 20. extra for a bra that was not part of my choice for this month--I already opted out for Feb., but I wanted just the 29. + shipping bra that I chose tonight. If this is being counted as my Feb. VIP choice, cancel.\nAre we not allowed to buy a la carte items marked down for VIP members, when we did not want the outfit chosen for us for 49.? As a VIP member, is everything we buy 49.+?

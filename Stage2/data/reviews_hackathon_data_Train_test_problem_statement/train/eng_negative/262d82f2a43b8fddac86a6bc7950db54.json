They should just tell you up front the if your mattress has any tears or stains they will refuse to take it. Instead they ask if you want them to when your at the store paying, so you think everything is great and no worries. Then the delivery truck shows up and the delivery guy say no they won't want me to put that on my truck like it some piece of trash in the side of the road. When a mattress is 15 years old of coarse it's gonna have a stain or two or maybe a rip.\nNot happy at all thanks for the burden.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:40:32.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

However I ordered my flowers for 13th a day before Valentines as I knew this would be a busy day for deliveries. Unfortunately today is the 14th and my flowers did not arrive yesterday and still aren't here today!. I emailed prestige and received an email from 'Darren' who told me this is because I opted for the free delivery and I should of gone for the 2.99 24hr service. I did not go for the 24hr service as I placed my order on the 5th Feb and the flowers would be dead by valentines if they arrives on the 6th. The free std delivery said up to 2 working days so I selected this option as the date I requested was 8 days from my order date so thought this would leave plenty of time. What is the point of asking what date you want the flowers delivered if you are not going to try to honour it. They had 8 days they could have posted them 4, 3 or even 2 days before to make sure they got here on time had I only ordered flowers for my wife she could of got up this morning to nothing believing I had forgot all about Valentine's day leading to an argument and possibly causing damage to my marriage. I am currently arguing for a refund as these were for valentines but getting no where.\nIf you are thinking about ordering for a special occasion do not use this company you either have to pay 2.99 for 24 hour delivery and they will arrive too early and die before you need them or go for std and they won't arrive on time!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:10:14.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Further 1 h phone call. The reply was they need to inspect the item, despite clearly seeing the photo. Although they were not able to explain what they would be inspecting and what conditions were needed before a refund\nNot only will I be without a buggy over 1 week before the refund is issued, I asked for a curtsy buggy in the interim, I was advised this was against policy, the person I spoke to said it clearly explains this on the website. However he was unable to find it and said later it was not on the website.\nI am awaiting collection and inspection (although they are not able to say what an inspection will involve) before issuing a refund.\nI have no trust in this company and would advise caution if you need to address a problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T20:45:47.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

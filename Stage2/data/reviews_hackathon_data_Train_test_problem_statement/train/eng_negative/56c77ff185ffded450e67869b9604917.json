I had simple questions, and after two tries, I gave up getting a full response. I wanted to know the correct part number for the Roadmaster plugs for my C-Max. That took 2 responses to get, but the question of how these items were kept in place was not answered in either response. I don't want to keep buying them if they fall off and I had seen a review note that the person was buying \"replacements.\" I received no response to that.\nI suggest these folks take a little more time to read and fully comprehend what is being asked.

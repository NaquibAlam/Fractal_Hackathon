The shipping date on Opticontacts.com was posted as the same as the order date, DAY 0. I thought great. Then 4 days later, I call since no tracking number was posted and they say they'll email me the tracking number. Then the shipping date on Opticontacts.com gets modified to DAY 4 surreptitiously. I call again, speak to unfriendly customer service, then receive the USPS Priority Mail Tracking Number. According to USPS, the package didn't actually get to the USPS origin site until DAY 4. Estimated delivery date is DAY 6. On DAY 6, no package arrives, and it's listed on USPS as \"In transit.\" It's DAY 7, and still nothing and it's still listed on USPS as \"In transit\" and expected delivery DAY 6... And Opticontacts site still doesn't even list the Tracking Number.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:26:47.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

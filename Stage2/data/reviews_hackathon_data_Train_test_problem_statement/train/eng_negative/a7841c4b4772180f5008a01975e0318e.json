When asked about this the response was well it's only the last 5 digits (which it doesn't actually state on the page) and *only* is almost everything. the first 3 digits are generally a region code which can be somewhat easily determined meaning that a hacker would essentially have every digit but 1. And their response is that they can't secure that page for some odd reason.\nSince apparently I can't reply to the reply...No, where it prompts for social security number is still on your site. It hasn't passed the data onto the FL DMV yet at that point.

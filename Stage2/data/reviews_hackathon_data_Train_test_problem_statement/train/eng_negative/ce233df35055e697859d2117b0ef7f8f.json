The Bad - The TIles around tthe pool areas are dangerous when wet(not the Correct Tiles at all)- ateam doing digging at the Hotel Dolphin pool left a lot of debris, small piles of concrete at the pool Steps, ony after i pointed out that this should be Cordened Off , did they take any action, placing Yellow Tape over it.\n(Not a good Advert for Safety Precautions at all)\n3.The Very Very Ugly - just after we arrived, we went for Dinner in the Main Restaurant, while carrying a plate of Food to my table , i slipped on (what can only be described as a gresy patch of Floor), both feet went up in the air, i landed on the Tile floor,hurt my left elbow, right ankle, when i got up I discovered my left wrist was deeply cut by the Plate, the waiters immediately bandaged my wrist and the Manager came over to see,Later while sitting in the Lobby bar the Manager insisted i see the Hotel Doctor ( and i use the word Doctor very loosely) he insisted i needed stitches , i maintained i did not as the wound was gelling together ok , but against my wishes he put in the so called stitches, he seemed more interested in money matters than his Hippocratic Oath. he wanted me to go back the next day, i did not, to me he was a Veternarian, not a doctor??(he spent more time farfing about, than giving me Medical attention)\nOn the day that we were leaving and checking Out, the Management of the Hotel tried to stick me with a bill for Â£250.00, I refused to pay it , as the Hotel was responsible for the accident i had and the Doctor put in stitches, i did not want or Need.\nOne of the Managers tried to insist i pay this bill,even trying to rattle me\nby saying they would get the police , i told them no bother, its a civil matter , not a criminal one.\nThey even took off the Transfer bus , my luggage and my partners who had no connection with this and locked it in a storage room, again trying to rattle me.\nThe General Manager got involved, and only when i got the Guest Relations Manager, who was in the doctors office with me , and confirmed with her that i did not want or need stitches , only then did the Management back down- and I DID NOT PAY\nAs the Transfer bus had now left without us, i insisted that the Hotel get and pay for a taxi to the Airport, after some more wrangling with them\nthey then agreed to do so, Where was the Thomas Cook Rep,? he was nowhere to be seen , did not appear and told me to sort it out myself, he was as much use as a 'Chocolate Teapot' totally useless!!!!\nThis is not a good Advert for this Hotel and i would like to see (DIETER G. General Manager) reply to this review or does he only reply to good reviews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T05:18:36.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I received a reminder to cancel or renew on the 26th of Jan 2017. I then started to cancel my domain after checking with the person it was set up for but was told that I needed to have done so before the 25th of Jan. As such I will now be charged for a full year and the cancellation will take place in 2018. I obviously disputed this but that was never acknowledged. I just had to pay and suck it up. My last message went un-responded to until the early hours of the 24th of Feb which just by chance is when they slapped me with a reminder fee that because I haven't paid I would now have to pay Â£10 more. SO despite an open ticket trying to cancel my subscription it was now going to cost me extra to cancel.\nI have reluctantly paid and canceled but continue to received payment reminders, including via text (Maybe link your systems together!?).\nIt all comes across as very dodgy. Send one reminder one day after the cut off, and then with open tickets to cancel an account start adding reminder fees so I can't pursue the ticket further as if I don't pay it'll just get more and more expensive.\nSend reminders BEFORE cut off and make it clear that you intend to add fees in those emails! DON'T hide them behind your terms and conditions wall! Also, read ticket messages and respond to the questions/statements made by users rather than just copy and paste your scripted responses.

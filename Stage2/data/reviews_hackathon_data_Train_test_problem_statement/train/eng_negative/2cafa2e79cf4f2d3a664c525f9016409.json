I had researched lots of other websites and this was the best deal. Same description as other sites and all had identical photos with base included. I ordered x2 on 24.12.16 and delivery dated stated 04.01.17. Four weeks of waiting, emails and telephone calls I was contacted via email that I would need to pay an additional £190 if I wanted the product! The company had obviously made a mistake with the price when I bought it but rather than honour the sale made as advertised they said either I pay the extra or they would refund. I am appalled at both their poor customer service and the fact they can take my money then ask for more weeks later. The price has now gone up to £315 on the website with exactly the same description and photos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T22:37:55.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I ordered it in plenty of time, received it, and decided a week before the party to put in batteries. It did not work! I called and explained the situation and that I would order another one but needed it for the party (in a week).\nThe response was that I'd have to pay the extra charge. I asked the Agent to speak with her supervisor since it was not my fault. The answer can back NO, I would have to pay. I was extremely polite but told her that this was my first purchase from Figi's and it will be my last.\nThis company needs to understand that for a $10 bill it was foolish to loose a customer.\nMoral: YOU NEVER GET A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION! Buyer beware, customer service is VERY inflexible and definitely should drop the word \"service\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:18:17.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

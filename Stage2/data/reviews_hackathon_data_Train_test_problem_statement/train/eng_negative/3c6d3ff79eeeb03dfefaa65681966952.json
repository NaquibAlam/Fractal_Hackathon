Completely understandable!\nHowever, - Almost two weeks now has gone by with my shipment order stating a \"delivered status\". I have not received my glasses to understand that it has been delivered. I called two days ago 02/20/17 to speak to a automated system, seems speaking to an actual human for customer service is impossible. I also sent an email with no response. Here I am frustrated with good money spent and no package in sight. There are no actual people to speak to only some automated system. Status says delivered but no confirmation to what address or time. I am patiently waiting for a response, I want a refund and to be through with firmoo. Do yourself a favor and skip over this website no matter how many cheesy offers and specials they present. Some foreign company/website that is money hungry with bad business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T21:18:34.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

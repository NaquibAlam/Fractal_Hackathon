They say they will call you in between about your delivery time, and never did, I had to call customer service the next day.. This delivery was drug out for 4 days I called the store and talked to a managaer, He was rude and said they always run over on time and they would be back the next evening between 1130 and 130 am again.I SAID thats crazy.I asked for a refund and the manager said I have to call corporate and speak to them to get a check by mail I decided to scheduled for the early truck between 8/4pm, i never got a call until 6pm, and they delivered at 630pm.We recieved the chuna cabinet we ordered with a broken light bulb shattered all over the inside of it. Between bickering with customer service showing up at 1 in the morning, not coming the following day the next and waiting 4 days total for my supoosed delivery next day between 4 and 11 pm, and recieving my cabinet with shattered glass inside, never will I shop at a Gardner white.

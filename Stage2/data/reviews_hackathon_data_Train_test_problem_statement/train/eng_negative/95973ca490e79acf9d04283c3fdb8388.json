Booked a trip on Friday paid $400. Deposit called Sunday to change the date move it back a week because of a previous commitment. Was told I could not change the date because the airline already had the deposit. But.... if I purchased ins. For 150 . Per person I could be refunded $100. 2nd option was to pay 109. Per person and I could get $182. Towards a the new date . However if I went the previous week my price would increase by $400. For the same package. I call the airline to verify that they had the deposit. They told me they only take $10. Per person to reserve the flight. I tried to speak to other people from blue sun vacations and none would budge or be helpful at all . Bad business practices.

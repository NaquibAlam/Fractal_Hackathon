I received the dress and it is a beautiful dress but did not look good on me. So I called to get a return authorization and was told I couldn't return it because the tag was removed from the dress. Unfortunately my pet had pulled the tag. The dress was perfect and not damaged in anyway. They would not even discuss the issue with me. This is to reply to promgirl's statement . I read your return policy and totally understand that the dress be unwashed ,not worn or damaged . The dress was in perfect condition as I did not wear it, wash it etc...I had just received the dress the evening before and called first thing the next day. My issue is that just because the promgirl tag was off the dress they refuse a return . The plastic piece that held the tag is still on the dress !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:59:01.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

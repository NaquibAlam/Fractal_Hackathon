Usually give older cars. The rates are very high compared to any other rental car. They make money on extras like full insurance, road side assistance, their fees etc, especially if you have foreign licence. Please check your final rate per day. It will be very high compared to others. The excuses they gave was shocking. The agent, Chris Elliot, who is the duty manager at the Melbourne airport , said the rates are based on the cars available with them at that time and the demand! He added the demand was due to Air show ( that got over a day ago) and the Grand prix ( grand prix was after 2 weeks). The agent made several mistakes on the invoice including the return dates and amount. On top of it he send an email the nest day asking the car rego! I spend too much with them. Stay away if possible.\nTip: I tried wwwAirportrentals.com, not only it was super easy and quick, I saved loads of money. The insurance is on them, they send the cover details promptly and followup to see if all went well! The staff are super friendly too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:00:24.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

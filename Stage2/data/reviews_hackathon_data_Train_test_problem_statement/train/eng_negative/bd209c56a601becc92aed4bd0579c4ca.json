The web site stated that orders are shipped from Canada (all prices Quote: d in $CDN with Canadian flag displayed) and accepted PayPal payments, which are two conditions for me to engage. Also the site promotes free shipping. I thought I would try you out and placed an order on Feb. 17 considering \"free shipping\" and continued browsing the website over the next several days. I received an email on Feb 17 stating that the 1 item order had been shipped. I was quite impressed and noted hundreds of items I would be interested in. I processed a second small order within the next few days for some L.E.D. bulb samples. I have since accumulated a few other items in my shopping cart on the site. I endure 4 emails a day (spam) and yet have still not received a single item (Mar. 16). What makes me most angry is how much time that has gone into this attempted purchase just to repair a lamp.\nToo bad for MiniInTheBox. I'm only out $47.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T06:34:12.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The check in was fine and the representative was nice. Then the crazy started.\nEven tho the access hours are posted didn't mean that the office was open so no carts available...sometimes for hours in the middle of the day. The parking lot was full of homeless people so I didn't feel safe going by myself. Then the elevator broke...my space is on the second floor. So I am schlepping stuff up and down stairs.\nToday I arrived when the website said you were open, but your employee was 30 minutes late. And the elevator is still not working. So I take a load up two flights of stairs and the interior door is locked. When I go back down the stairs the door at the bottom locked behind me so now I am locked in a stairwell. A back door has been propped open with a piece of cardboard ( I'm the first one here which means the building wasn't secure all night) and when I walk around the side of the building the gate is also standing wide open.\nThere are other customers standing around waiting for the late employee and they are all complaining that this is an incompetent business, the elevator will take forever to fix and that management is not paying any attention to this property.\nAs soon as I can I am moving out - I've only ben here two weeks. If the elevator is still broken and I can't get a cart I will be writing bad reviews on every social media outlet I can find.\nRidiculous, frustrating and unprofessional.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T23:00:50.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

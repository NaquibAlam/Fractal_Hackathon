I even chose expedited shipping so that I could receive it the week before the game. On the Tuesday before the game, they called me and said the flag would ship two days AFTER the Superbowl. I could have chose other vendors and paid a little more for a guaranteed flag by the Superbowl. Fortunately the company allowed me to cancel my order. But with no other options, as it was too late to get one elsewhere, I am still without a flag. Hence two stars instead of one.\nIncidentally I saw a response by AmericanFlags.com to a customer complaining that their flag didn't arrive in a timely manner. The response by the company claimed that technically they were within their guaranteed expedited shipping window even though it took them many days to process and ship the order. I find this an unacceptable cop-out to a customer who is legitimately dissatisfied with the company's timeliness. I'm disgusted and won't shop at this vendor ever again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:04:08.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Today being told that I need to just \"keep trying [to call the agents in Yangon, whose phone numbers ring out] and hope it works out\".\nThis is a just a quick summary of the service provided:\n- December 2015, advised by Pack and Send, Pultney Street that they have experience shipping from Adelaide to Yangon and that it will take 32 days. They advise their office will be closed over the New Year period and will reopen on 4 January 2017.\n- We go to Pack and Send, Pultney Street on 4 January. The office is not open, even though we were told it would be, so they have to go to Pack and Send, Unley.\n- We are told by Pack and Send, Unley that it may take a while to ship as the shipping companies are closed for most of January. We are not told when the shipment will be sent, what the process will be, that it will go via Singapore or what the shipping Incoterms are.\n- We email Pack and Send, Unley again on 8 January, asking if they require any further documents. No response it received.\n- We call Pack and Send, Unley on 13 January to check they have received our email. We are told that they have received our email and will send the Bill of Lading shortly.\n- We email Pack and Send, Unley on 22 January asking for the Bill of Lading.\n- Pack and Send, Unley send the Bill of Lading to the wrong email address on 31 January.\n- We email Pack and Send, Unley on 31 January asking if they know the ETA and whether we need to contact the agent or if they will contact us when the shipment arrives.\n- We receive an email on 2 February saying that we should have an ETA in one week. Our question regarding contacting the agent is not answered.\n- We email Pack and Send, Unley on 13 February asking whether we have an ETA and again asking whether we need to contact the agent. We do not receive a response.\n- We try to call the agent on 16 February using the numbers listed on the Bill of Lading. None of their phone numbers work. We look up their email on the internet. Their email address bounces.\n- We email Pack and Send, Unley on 16 February asking whether we have an ETA and asking whether we need to contact the agent as none of their phone numbers are being answered\n- We receive a response on 20 February, with the ETA and again not answering our question regarding the agent\n- We are told that \"the phone numbers of the agent appear to be correct\" and to just \"keep trying and hope it works out\"\nThanks for nothing Pack & Send!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:12:46.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

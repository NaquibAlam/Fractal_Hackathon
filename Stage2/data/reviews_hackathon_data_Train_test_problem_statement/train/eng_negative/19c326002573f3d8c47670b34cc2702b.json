We are travelling overseas in April and want to use our Qantas Frequent Flyer cards as a cash card. That's pretty simple to do online however one our cards is not suitable for cash card and needs updating. We rang the Frequent Flyer Service Centre and gave up after waiting for 25 minutes for a real person to answer the phone. So we emailed Qantas customer service. That was over a week ago and there has been no reply. We looked up the Qantas website and found that they have an office at 144 North Terrace, Adelaide so we drove to Adelaide (from the hills) found a park ($18 cost!) and walked for 20 minutes to the address. Office closed and apparently has been closed for about 13 years! We think you need to lift your game Qantas. Think we'll just go to a bank and get our cash cards - its easier!

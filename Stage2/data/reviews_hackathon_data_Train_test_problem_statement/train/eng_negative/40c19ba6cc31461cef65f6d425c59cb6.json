I contacted customer service at that time as I got an email saying my return was being processed, but no refund arrived, and a very nice Charles told me that he would look into it . He told me that he would find out what proof they had to deem it to have been installed and would get back to me in a week with a response. A quick response on this website from EasyApplianceParts acknowledged my complaint, was aware that Charles was looking into it and was confident that he would respond later in the day on February 21, 2017. According to my calendar, it is Mar 7, 2017 and no one, not even Charles has called me back to tell me when I would receive my refund. Here I sit, out $130 for the part and another $10 for the shipping for a part that was never installed as the dishwasher had already been deemed dead. Again, I only opened the package to confirm the right part, and it was, but again, was never installed. Honestly, after years of being a household consumer and purchasing many items online, I have never seen the likes of a company that has treated me so poorly. I find this totally unacceptable!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:21:29.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

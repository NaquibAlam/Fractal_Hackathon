I have had nothing but negative experiences with them recently on several orders, two quite large, I placed recently. They really should shut down their ordering business until/unless they learn how to handle ordering appropriately, following companies like Amazon, for example.\nAmong the problems I had most recently is one where two items out of a fairly sizable order (around 20 different items) were not shipped. The enclosed invoices in two of the partial orders—the 20 items were shipped in 6-8 separate mailings for some reason (suggesting to me that perhaps they ship from their multiple stores around the country, not a central warehouse)—showed bills for two items I had not ordered and in fact did not receive.\nOn the later, when I called, at least kohls.com confirmed I was only billed the full amount for what I ordered, not for what the enclosed invoices showed, items that were not shipped. Why on earth does Kohl’s do that in the first place? They really need to clean up their shipping invoices.\nHowever—and more importantly—I did not receive two items I DID order. And two items that I WAS charged $50+ for, as my credit card statement clearly showed.\nSo I called kohls.com and asked them to ship the two missing items. They said they could issue me in-store credit (I live several hours from the nearest store) or if I wanted the missing items shipped, I would have to pay for them (I already had paid for them!) and pay the $8.95 shipping. That is beyond bizarre—I already paid for them but to receive them I have to pay for them twice? That obviously makes no sense and surely is illegal as well, so I asked to talk to a supervisor who told me the same thing.\nI tried contacting support online and also got the same ridiculous responses.\nNote clearly the items were in-stock or several representatives, including supervisors, would not have said they could ship them to me if I’d pay for them again.\nIn the meantime, I had gotten a mailed “thank you” card signed, supposedly, by the president and CEO of Kohls, Kevin Mandell. The card says, “Customers like you are the reason we work so hard to deliver the great shopping experience, products and value that you deserve.”\nHUH? What “great shopping experience… that [I] deserve”? Ripping me off on two items, expecting me to pay for them twice?\nSo I searched online and found the email address for Mr. Mandell and sent him an email. The same day I got a reply from Joni, identified as “ACE Sr. Executive Correspondence Advisor, Office of the President.” After several rounds of email and phone tag with her, she again asked for my name, email address, and phone #—all three of which I had given her earlier—and said she’d process a refund for me.\nShe too claimed she cannot have the items shipped to me—the items I have been billed for! I replied to her that she certainly can. She can place the order herself, charge it to the CEO’s credit card if need be, and send me the missing $50 items. I have not had a response from her on that yet.\nOf course any company that understands mail order, whether amazon.com or any of many, many others I frequently order online from, would have instantly sent me the two missing items with an apology. Not Kohl’s, however.\nWell, at this point Joni has refunded a whopping $12+ to my credit card and given me $15+ in ridiculous Kohl’s Cash—when I had paid by credit card for more than the $50+ owed to me for the missing items. So $27 out of the $50—shorting me still $23 if one includes the Kohl’s Cash, shorting me $38 if I exclude that (which of course can only be used on their products and only for a very limited time period, and if I can’t get to the distant closest store, I have to pay more than half of that amount again for shipping—another $8.95).\nThat obviously is not acceptable. I have not heard back from her after I told her again to send me the missing items, but I believe she’s been out of the office for a couple days. I’ll update this review IF anything improves with kohls.com, but with the horrible experience so far even from the Office of the President, I am not holding my breath.\nIn my experience, kohls.com is a total disaster, including up to the top of the organization. I will be avoiding them and warn others to be prepared if you try doing business with them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T19:49:58.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

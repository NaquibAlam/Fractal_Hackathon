On their website, they state that they provide \"Only Original Products\". Delivery was okay and when the items arrived, on the face of it they looked like genuine Apple products. However, as I was doing a complete reinstall of the phone iOS - during the firmware checks the installation would get stuck and throw an error. I put back the old genuine battery and managed to complete the installation. Then I put back 'Mobymemory' battery and tried charging it - the battery didn't charge to 100% (only to 99%) and it would never reduce below 20%. I tried calibrating with no avail.\nNow to me it seems like the battery is not genuine. I am baffled that there are no third party body that could verify my findings and if true shutdown the site or trader.\nI was considering sending the items back and getting a refund, however I would be responsible for the postage cost and didn't fancy the hassle of chasing the trader.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T13:04:22.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

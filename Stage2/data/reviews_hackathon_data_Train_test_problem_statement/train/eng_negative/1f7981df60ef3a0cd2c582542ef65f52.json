It was more expensive so I had to pay an extra 11,50€, which I did.\nSo far, so more than a month later, I still haven't received the appropriate hose...you have received the items back, paid the bags and 5€...and there's still no news from the replaced hose...I sent you a mail, you replied it (last Friday) saying 'you' forwarded my message to the financial department...and since then...no hose, no answer to my question: when will I receive it? or more...will I receive it?\nIf I don't get the hose by Thursday, I'll be more than happy to leave a comment on your site with the whole story.\nI've been more than patient.\nWe are now Thursday and I still haven't had any reply, nor have I received the hose...unacceptable !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:23:05.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I went through all the screens, and unclicked all the pre-clicked options for insurance, etc. I was given a Quote: for $614 CAD (including taxes and fees) for the two tickets and paid for them using my credit card.\nThis is where things started to go hairy.. On the confirmation page, they showed an extra $30 charge for seat selection (even though I hadn't pre-selected any seats). So, I call Flighthub and am reassured that my card will only be charged for $614 CAD and that the \"seat selection\" option has been removed.\nThe next morning I receive an email stating that my reservations is \"on hold\" due to a fare change, and that it will be cancelled within a few hours if I do not call them. So, naturally, I call in to see what is going on and am informed that they want to charge me an extra $200 to keep the tickets because the fares have gone up since the time I booked and that they have not yet charged my card... ?!?!??!?!?!??!??!?!?!?!?!\nSeriously?? This is outrageous. I was told by their agent (Jaid) that their website is very dynamic and that you will never know if what you see on the website is what you will be charged. I was also informed that \"all airline websites\" are like this.\nI've used Flighthub before and had minor inconveniences in the past, but this is a game changer. Never again! And, please spread the word so that others don't go through this waste of time.

Other Canadian clothing web sites that carry this line list price in USD which is always 30% less than Canadian price due to exchange rate. They list pricing in multiple currencies.\nCalled them on this & response was the price is the price. Total lack of transparency & unwilling to do anything about this. Wanted to return item & they were supposed to send return authorization which never came & I would have had to pay return shipping.\nWill never buy anything from them ever again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T23:29:33.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

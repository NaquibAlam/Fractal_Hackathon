I was initially accepted by the Albury office. After almost 1 year there it was decided the Wagga Wagga office would be more suited. Wagga did nothing and decided it was \"too hard/complicated\" It then went back to Albury. Then to Penrith and I'm not entirely sure where it is now. My current solicitor is very nice but this process is very very slow.\nMy matter did sit before the Arbitration in April 2016 but unfortunately my barrister failed to have in her possession documents important to my matter.

Their fee is 26 Euros, and Record Go is 24 Euros for example. However, when I hired last month, they stated at the desk it was now 59 Euros. In my hand I had the Goldcar terms and conditions printed off from doyouspain.com on which site I booked the car. The terms clearly stated the refuel fee would be between 19-29 Euros for this car. At the desk they said they were not valid T&C's as I was now dealing with Goldcar?! As usual, at 9pm at night, you just have to accept and challenge later, which I have tried to do, in endless emails. The desk clerk even said 'what do you expect when the car hire is so cheap, we have to make money somehow'.\nIn recently email exchanges, they have advised that indeed the fee is 26 Euros, but the extra 33 Euros I was charged was because ''I took a diesel car, and I should have declined a diesel at the desk'' (I did not choose a diesel...I could'nt care less what type I have). I was not made aware of a 'new' diesel car using penalty at the desk and because I signed the contract (all in Spanish), it was as it was.\nSo, be very careful about this if you use this company from Feb 2017. Always book a petrol, decline a diesel if offered. 59 Euros is a rip off for a service fee. It's a shame, as I traditionally recommend my dozens of annual rental clients to them. That has now been taken out of our 2017 suggestions feed to guests.\nI'm sure Goldcar will reply to this with a 'you signed the contract' which indeed I did. I guess I was just stupid to believe the Goldcar terms provided on the site I booked on, believing they would be honoured at the desk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:56:23.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

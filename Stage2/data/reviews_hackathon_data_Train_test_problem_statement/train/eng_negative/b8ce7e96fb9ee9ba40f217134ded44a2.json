Can promise I will never shop there again. I received notification that they cancelled my order and fully refunded my account. When I asked why it was cancelled they accused me of knowing the price was wrong...\nThis was the email reply that I received after confronting them on their business ethics and false accusations towards me.... Email from Danielle Kizz\nFirst let me apologize it wasn't meant as an accusation. The item you ordered is selling elsewhere for $230.00 and up, and you paid $120.00.\nYou are right it is not your fault that the prices were wrong, however we do have a disclaimer on our site that says:\nThe content of the pages of this website is for your general information and use only.

They obviously do not have competent workers that can adjust prices correctly and this is not the first time Home Style Living done this...\nThey should really be proud of their business ethics...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:36:29.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

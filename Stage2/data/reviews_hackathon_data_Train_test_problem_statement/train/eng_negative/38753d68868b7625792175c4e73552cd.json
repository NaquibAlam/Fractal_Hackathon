Last year, I ordered patches from them. They promised to have it delivered on time. They gave me a specific date that I would have it in hand. Guess what? By the time that date came along, they hadn't even worked on the patches. Once they get your money, nobody answers your emails or phone calls.\nThis time around, I ordered a large number of hats. $8.5K worth. I was assured that they can do the design I wanted (I even sent prototypes of the hats so they can see what I was taking about) and that they would be able to meet their deadline. Guess what? Once they got the 2nd part of the $8.5K, they stopped responding to me. No updates. No nothing. They promised physical samples today and final products by next week. I had to call them and ask what the status? Their excuse? It was Lunar New Year, that they won't receive the samples until next week, that their factory just informed them yesterday that they won't be able to make the deadline.... that it would be the end of MARCH (it's February now) before I even got anything in hand. So yeah, I'm mad. I'm canceling my order. I'm going to get my money back. And I would avoid this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:49:08.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

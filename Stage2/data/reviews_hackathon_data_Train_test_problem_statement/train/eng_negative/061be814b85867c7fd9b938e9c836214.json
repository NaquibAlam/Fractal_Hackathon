The bottom of the lenses has the reading prescription - naturally.\nHowever, the user experience is poor - while reading, edges to the left and right are strongly distorted, making it seem like you are reading through a tube with blurred edges. The reading area should be much wider.\nI advised that she lets her brain get used to it for a few weeks before returning it. That has not helped. Now, reading the return policy, I see it needs to be unused with original tags and stickers to return it.\nHow can you have experienced the glasses without trying them? This is an unreasonable return policy. What will the company do with the returned prescription lenses anyway? This is their way to have a return policy on paper and then not really having a return policy in real life.\nNow that this part is disappointing, let's review the ordering process:\nMultiple times I uploaded the prescription online, and it didn't 'take' even though the web page confirmed the upload. I can't know it failed this way until a week later getting the reminder email to upload the prescription! After weeks of back and forth with customer support, finally I needed to send the prescription via email! After all that extra effort, it still took more than a month for the glasses to arrive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:19:01.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

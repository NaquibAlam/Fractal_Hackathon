I e-mailed Gala hotels but they did not reply. . Their voucher number did not relate to anything on the hotel booking system. The transfer from airport voucher never arrived.. I will be interested to see when I get my refund - there have been many public posts saying that Gala promise refunds but do not actually give them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T17:36:58.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

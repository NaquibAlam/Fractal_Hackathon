Appalling!! This service is a joke. I had a friend send me money, through my PayPal account, that I've had for years. I then had to confirm my email address, which for whatever reason, could not be done, online. I called customer service, and took care of it. Then, when I tried to make a payment, using my PayPal balance, through a site that readily accepts PayPal, it not only didn't go through, but when I called customer support again, they asked me to verify my identity. (That's a good thing.) But, the questions they asked we found from public records. Now, I was asked a question about my half-brother's wife. Simply because she shares my last name. Now, I have no idea really, ANYTHING about her. Anyway, after some other security questions, I was confirmed. But, they told me that the attempted purchase, didn't even show up! So, I tried to make the purchase, through a different merchant. (Who also accepts PayPal.) This purchase STILL did not go through. It showed up for more than I was trying to spend, too!! So, I attempted to put through another, smaller, purchase, with the customer service rep on the phone, and the website kept bouncing me to an, \"enter credit card information,\" screen. The representative was unable to solve the problem, and I couldn't make, what was supposed to be an easy, online purchase. I do not have a valid credit card. And even after verifying my bank account, I was STILL unable to spend my PayPal balance. If I HAD a credit card, I wouldn't have been trying to use this service in the first place!! They didn't do anything that they were designed for. I wouldn't recommend PayPal to my WORST ENEMY!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:08:04.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

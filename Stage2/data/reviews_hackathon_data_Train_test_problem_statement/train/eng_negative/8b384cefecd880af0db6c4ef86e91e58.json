In the email they wrote that they aim to contact me within 3 hours. They were not reachable by phone, I called around 5 times and waited 30 minutes before connection was broken. At the service desk at the airport I was recommended to contact KLM through Facebook, which I don't have. KLM never contacted me. I had to book a hotel and buy another flight with Swiss Air. 10 days after the canceled flight, KLM sent a standard email with an apology, but they didn't want to pay back the costs of the canceled flight. Very poor service, next time I will take another airline if possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:11:02.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

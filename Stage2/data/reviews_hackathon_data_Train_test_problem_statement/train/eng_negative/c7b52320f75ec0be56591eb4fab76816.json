I purchased two Seagate Ironwolf ST8000VN0022 3.5in 8TB NAS HDDs two weeks ago along with a QNAP TS-453A-4G 4 Bay NAS, upon receiving these after setting it up, I noticed a huge amount of noise coming from the drives. Upon pulling them out I checked the serial number which ended in N002, rather than N0022, meaning they sold me a prior model of this drive NOT ADVERTISED AT ALL ON THEIR WEBSITE that had been discontinued.\nThis was the original issue, however now it turns out the QNAP is dysfunctional and has to be sent back too. QNAP have confirmed the issue and have offered a replacement but it has to be returned through PCCG, however the disgusting, reprehensible service people here say it will take 2-4 weeks to replace it saying they have to confirm this with QNAP, despite QNAP saying this is not necessary, and it has already been confirmed. They tried to deceive me by giving me 6 month old hard drives which were the wrong model and which I wouldn't have noticed if not for the noise they made, and now they refuse to replace a $700 QNAP in a timely manner. I work for myself and this has cost me over 10 hours of hassle dealing with the disgusting people at PCCG and setting up a system where the drives are 6 month old and discontinued only to find this out later on, and now the QNAP isn't functional.\nI'll go to the ACCC over this because it's absolutely disgusting and I'm almost sure they are trying to punish me for my previous negative review, which they harassed me on the phone over. I'm also going to complain on their Google Trusted store accreditation. They tried to deceive me by selling me a product that had been discontinued for 6 months and was not what I paid for, and now they refuse to replace a faulty QNAP.\nI can barely believe how horrific the service is, they obviously took to heart what I said about never coming back in my prior review and how I mentioned I would tell everyone I know about how disgusting they are, now it seems they are punishing me for it, despite their own deception and incompetence. Worst experience I have ever had with ANY store.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T03:21:40.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A sales rep \"check the garage\" and assured me it was in stock and would ship within a few days. Good deal. Send my car to the garage to get painted and waited and waited and waited for my spoiler. I never received a tracking number so I called to see what was up. After being bounced from department to departed I was told the spoiler was on back order from the manufacture and would take 30-45 days to come in. So now I'm screwed. At this point I try to cancelled my order since it hasn't shipped and apparently won't ship anytime soon. Again bounced from department to department for literally hours (2) finally I get someone who cancels my order. Thank god that's over. Got the email confirmation that my order was cancelled. Thumbs up. I leave for vacation, I'm not a tech savvy young buck so I don't need to check my emails on vacations 4 days later I got an email saying my order had shipped. The next day I get one saying my order couldn't be cancelled bc it had already shipped from the manufacture?! What the absolute hell?! Spent all day trying to call and leave messages for \"Vincent the manager\". After another 40 mins on the phone again, bounced from department to department(one said he was off today, one said he had left already for the day, excuses just go on and on) an employee claimed he knew this Vincent was in because he had spoken to him....what for frickin kind of but backwards service is this?! I highly recommend to NEVER ORDER FROM CARID! THEY ARE CROOKED AND HAVE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:38:35.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

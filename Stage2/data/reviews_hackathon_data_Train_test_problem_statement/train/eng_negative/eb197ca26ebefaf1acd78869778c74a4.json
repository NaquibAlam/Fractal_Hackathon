But suddenly they told me my account was closed and All My Points Forfeited! Effectively I lost £400 ($600) and there is no appeals process, the decision is final. They said I took two (out of hundreds) surveys \"too fast\" plus after two surveys they detected what they call \"fraud\" but they provide zero evidence or proof! They keep the £400+ from my hard work, and I end up with zero. I am on panel base, cint, swagbucks, ipoll, crowdology & many other survey sites and this has never happened so clearly I am innocent and they have stolen my hard earned wages. Awful. In addition, they never warned me the first time they saw a so-called problem. No warning or advice for a hard working employee, just a sudden being thrown out. And other members will probably be worried about me due to suddenly disappearing. This company is terrible, other members have also told about imaginary fake profiles \"winning\" the prize draws, which is fraudulent also. Very bad company, don't waste your time.\nUpdate: Toluna's reply to my review (below) said they were sorry and I should email them so they can \"help\". So I did and my email was ignored. So their \"reply\" below was just another P.R. stunt to try and make it look like they aren't as bad as my review states.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:58:12.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The dress was over an inch off the ground around my ankles. Based off the sizing chart and length of the dress described in the photos I'm scared to order off here again... Dresses should be made longer. Shorter girls can get dresses hemmed but taller girls are just out of luck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:27:46.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

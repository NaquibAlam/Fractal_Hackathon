What rubbish! It was a 3 day hike in the Andes, starting and finishing at the same village, followed by a train/bus trip to MP.\nI paid extra for a single supplement, and then still had to pay extra for a sleeping bag - why was that not included in the accomodation charge?\nI'd also paid extra for a transfer back to airport. However the hotel Intrepid put me in knew nothing about the airport transfer. An email from Interpid told me it was up to me to track this down.\nTotally deceptive and unethical behaviour on behalf of Interpid.\nI will NEVER travel with them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T12:00:56.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

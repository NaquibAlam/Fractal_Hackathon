In the web site was written that I could cancel my reservation within 4 hours.\nNo email contact was available!\nLogging to my edreams there was the reservation but with no indication how to cancel!\nI tried different phone numbers without success . Firstly i contacted the Italian edreams and after half an hour ttempt and a lot of money spent (it is a number at which you are heavily charged) they said that they could not cancel because central edreams took the money,\nI tried your spanish speaking number:no reply and finaly i got your english speaking number. I waited a reply for more than half an hour.!!.. That really to much. When I was desparing I got a reply from an operator.\nFinally i was successfull and I succeeded to speak with the operator who was really very kind and solved my problem: but wath a fatigue!\nSo very good service from the operator, but very bad service from edream.\nI will deeply consider if booking by edreams in the future...\nRegards\nAlberto Pigini", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T20:02:04.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A salesman for Oceane stopped me and asked if he could use a product on my face. I repeatedly told him that I only use organic natural products on my face. I didn't have my glasses so he read the ingredients to me and they WERE Natural. (But later when I got home and put on my glasses, I saw that there were synthetic chemicals in with the natural ones.)\nSo he applied it to my face and I still was nervous about buying it. I asked about their return policy and he assured me that Customer Service would help me. So I bought it. By the time I got home my face was bright red, swollen and sore. I immediately, after taking selfies, called about returning the unopened product. I was told I could only exchange it. But as I'm obviously allergic to their product I don't want to do that! So I have a very expensive unopened product and an empty wallet. I so hope they will reimburse me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T18:17:41.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

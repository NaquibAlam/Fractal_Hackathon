Things usually go well as the website is user friendly. However my recent trip to Washington dullies proved otherwise. My flight from San Francisco to dullies was delayed by a total of 24 hours and I informed rental cars via their online chat service. The first thing I was told was that nothing can be done and my rental will be forfeited even though I had paid in FULL already. The online sales associate was very unhelpful and mentioned that since I have signed the agreement I should have read it and not sign if I did not agree. The sales associate proceeded to type with exclamation marks. I was never rude in my dealings with the sales associate and I believe there should be a log of the online chat service.\nOnly when I contacted thrifty myself did I get things sorted out.\nIn today's world with so many car rental options I will stick with other safer options and not rentalcars. Tried tested but failed. I will never use rentalcars again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T09:20:12.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

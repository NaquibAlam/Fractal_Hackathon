Over a month ago we purchased 4 tickets for over $2600, sect 255 row 8. 10 days before event we were given a option of an \"upgrade\" to lower level in corner. We declined offer, prefer to be in center of court. 9 days before event was told our sect. 255 row 8 tickets were not available as offered.It was too close to time for event to find any tickets we liked or were much higher in price.We were not given the option of or money back. I have owned my own business for over 30 yrs,one thing I have learned is to not to promise anything you can't get do.We were given a coupon for $25 off our next purchase in next 60 days, TicketCity is not trustworthy. From the corner we will be fans of the game but not a fan of TicketCity. We feel we are owed some sort of compensation from a company that did not supply the product we purchased now 6 wks ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T05:43:21.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

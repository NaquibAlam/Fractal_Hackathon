David your sales person was even rude when I came to ask for help, I was advised that \"I had no rights to complain as I have missed my deadline\". Worrying.\nAfter a few months I had a problem with the docking of the keyboard to the screen that was a struggle, I wasn't taken seriously and told that software issues are not covered with the Flexirent warranty, until I called the manager. He was more helpful. He changed the keyboard and that worked.\nNow I have a problem with the input of the speaker / headphone, first I was not taken seriously again, that I still have warranty through my Flexirent installment plan, I was told to call Flexirent to have this looked at. I then I was several times told the input looks scratched as if it was dropped, which actually should also have been covered by my warranty, as sold to me (Customer consumer right act 1984) then I was informed these are not the conditions I bought the laptop with. I was then also told I should bring my speakers to the shop so Nicolae could test the input....???? At Harvey Normans are many speakers.\nNikolae your employee who handled my issue was neither helpful nor willing to listen to me as a customer. I am sorry but this is not how you treat your customers I certainly can’t do so at my job. Your staff in Blanchardstown is not very helpful and made me as a customer feel like a fool and a liar, I did not get the input repaired, after all I was asked if I did back up my data because this will all be lost with the repair. I had to leave this just made me speechless. I won’t buy anything there anymore to avoid any further aggravation or even at Harvey Normans at all for this matter.\nPlease change the training and communication of your staff or your policies, as I think this is not customer service you provide in Balanchardstown at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:41:22.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

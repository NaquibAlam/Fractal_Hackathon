Germany is famous for being a \"customer service black hole\", and CLS Computer and its rude employees are not helping to change it. JUST BEWARE, AMAZON.DE AFTER READING THEIR EMAILS TO ME TOLD THEM TO STOP CONTACTING ME IMMEDIATELY. DIDNT HELP UNFORTUNATELY. no more businesses with quasi companies like that, why? - they are hundreds of better companies who value honesty and its customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T18:11:30.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

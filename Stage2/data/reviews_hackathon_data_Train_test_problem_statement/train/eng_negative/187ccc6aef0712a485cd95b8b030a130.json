I specifically told the guy I wanted these cordless Bluetooth headphones as I use them in my business & I have to be able to walk around while on the phone.\nHe shipped me the wired JBL Reflect Mini In-Ear Headphones with In-Line Mic instead - which I can't use.\nAfter I received them I looked online - trying to make sense of what they'd done & found this ad which I screen-captured - which I can't seem to post here.\nI found, an ad for the \"wired\" headphones they \"erroneously\" sent & they were on sale for only $39.55. So even though I didn't want these, if I had wanted them - they were hosing me on the price at $50.10.\nNonetheless, they sent me the wrong ones so I called & the guy (who after much discussion and weasel-ly attempts to the contrary) said he'd give me a Return Authorization for a full refund & email me a label. I also did a screen-shot of it & the Label's tracking info which I couldn't copy here.\nI sent the product back promptly - on 1/5/17.\nBy the way, I went over to my local FedEx location and spoke with a guy there who I always deal with. He told me that FedEx picked up the package at the post office where I dropped it and delivered it to another post office in PA. They have no way to track it beyond their drop-off. I believe I've done everything I could have in this case to comply with World Wide Stereo's RMA requirements can't get back my money from these people. They conveniently keep saying they haven't received my returned product back yet. Since they sent the label to me, how is that my fault?\nNext stop, Better Business Bureau, Social Media, then Amazon.\nSteve Parker", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:38:19.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

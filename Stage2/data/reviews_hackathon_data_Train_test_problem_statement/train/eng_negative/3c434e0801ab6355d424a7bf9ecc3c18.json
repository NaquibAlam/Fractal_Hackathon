That means its working for someone other than myself. When the hard drive crashed, they offered to upgrade to the latest operating system. I was agreeable and had the drive replaced and upgraded. Even though bootcamp made a partition for a windows installation, the windows system will not go on line. It worked fine on my old MacBook pro. I have downloaded three different sets of drivers and adapters, changed from 32 to 64 bit installations. But it will not go on line. Apple refuses to work with the windows system. I must turn to another source than apple for help. I'm considering just buying a windows laptop. two programs I use as a teacher require windows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T23:43:01.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

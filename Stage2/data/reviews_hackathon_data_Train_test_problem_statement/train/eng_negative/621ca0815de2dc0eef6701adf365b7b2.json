Multitrip wouldnt approve the costs with the hospital while we were there, they wanted to check prices before approving, so to be able to leave the hospital I had to pay by credit card once he had the required treatment, not great but I can deal with that. The problem arrises when you try and claim the costs back, multitrip use 'travel claims services ltd' to process their claims, they appear to be a loss adjuster. I completed all the paperwork meticulously and sent it in. Three weeks later and no reply I chased them up, when they finallly do answer the phone they seem pretty disinterested and say they are waiting for a hospital report, I point out this is a lie as I have sent them the medical report and invoice from the hospital along with my credit card bill, reply is 'erm ok sir sorry about that, we must be waiting for something else' I said I was going to post a review if they couldnt come back to me with anything today, they didnt seem to care, didnt come back with anything so here it is. They cannot give a date when the claim will be processed or when we will be paid, all the claim is legitimate. I feel very let down and disappointed, I thought I had decent cover but it appears I dont, I need to pay the pretty large credit card bill for the treatment and I'm not sure when or if I'm going to get reimbursed. They may be competitive and easy to get cover but watch out if you need to claim, they are proving to be a nightmare for me. I rely on trustpilot reviews a lot so hopefully this review will help others, if you do take out a policy make sure they pay the hospital direct however long this takes, dont pay out and hope to claim it back because it is not straightforward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:46:25.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

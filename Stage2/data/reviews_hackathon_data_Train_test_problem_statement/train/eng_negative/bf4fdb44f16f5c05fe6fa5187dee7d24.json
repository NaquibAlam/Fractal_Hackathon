I have purchased many times, with superb shipping and customer service. However, I don't think I will be shopping again on Ssense, due my most recent situation with them.\nI'm originally from Toronto and move to Greece permanently. I was visiting Toronto for holidays, my best mate and I saw a pair of boots online (Marsells) and wanted to buy a pair for each other for Christmas. So we called the store in Montreal and asked them to bring the boots in so we can try them on, they are $860 so we wanted them to fit perfectly . We gave the store more than a week's notice. We drove 6 hours to the Montreal store, only to find out that only one pair was brought in. We told the staff that we came from Toronto specifically for these boots, but the staff didn't care and did nothing to resolve the situation. The store staff really made this experience horrible and didn't have any empathy for what happened.\nThe best part of this whole situation is that the Marsell boots increased in price the next day and we don't know why.\nMy mate emailed your staff, telling them about the mishap, but again nothing was done to resolve the situation.\nI think I am done with Ssense, your staff left a horrible taste in my mouth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T12:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T21:56:19.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

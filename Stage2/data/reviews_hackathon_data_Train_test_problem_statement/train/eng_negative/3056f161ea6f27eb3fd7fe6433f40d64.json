I was then called at 6:05 pm and told that my table had shattered and the delivery would have to be re-scheduled.\nFirst of all, I had to take vacation time off from work, then I sat at home all day waiting for the delivery from 12:30-6:05. Then it was never delivered.\nI can't take any more time off for the delivery.

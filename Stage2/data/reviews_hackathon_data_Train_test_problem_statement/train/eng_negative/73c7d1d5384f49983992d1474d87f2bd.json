I was told my unit rate would be 0.1132 per unit. I supplied my direct debit details upon signing up. My first bill, never arrived, but I did receive a letter informing me that my account was in arrears. I rang to ask why the bill hadn't been taken from bank account, to be told they never set up the direct debit! I was to receive a call back the next day, to set up the direct debit. I never got the call. I contacted them again yesterday and was told that I would receive a call between 9 and 9.30 this morning, but once again, I didn't receive a call. I am being charged a rate of 0.1635 per unit, not what I signed up to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:24:52.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

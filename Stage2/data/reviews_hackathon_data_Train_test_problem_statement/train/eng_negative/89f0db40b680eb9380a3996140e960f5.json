Not get connected to someone at HQ saying they don't know what the website is referring to, and can't do what it claims, but please call the local store instead...\nSo I call the local store, who would like to help, but, all their orders have to come from Melbourne and if they don't gave it have to in turn order from HQ which can take a couple of months.\nSo. The local store gets a bad logistical deal and HQ doesn't know what its own website is claiming. So much room for improvement guys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T12:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:47:55.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

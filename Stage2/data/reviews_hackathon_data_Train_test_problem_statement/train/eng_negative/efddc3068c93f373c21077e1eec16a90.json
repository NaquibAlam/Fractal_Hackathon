The most you can have is three in a year and they must not be within three months of each other, and is only extended up to 14 days from the date due. Why on earth someone thinks that's a good thing I'll never know. Compare that to Telstra who are happy to help their customers by extending deadlines by a month or more at times, and who are happy to arrange payment plans to keep you going.\nWhen someone loses their job and is without income for a few weeks these things matter. Try getting a new job when your mobile is cut off... And try deciding between feeding your family and paying the mobile bill.\nAll I'm asking for is some common decency and flexibility. I've been a Vodafone customer for 18 years and I'm going to pay my bills guys...just help me out when I need it by giving me some time to pay!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:33:56.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

In my case, when they arrived the side channels were too long.\nCalled up customer services and was told to force them in and that they are supposed to be \"tight\". This damaged the window frame.\nSpent a good chunk of the afternoon on the phone to their customer services. Eventually after sending in photos, I was told by a really rude guy called Alex that there wasn't a problem, that he could see the damage being caused to my windows, but otherwise it looks fine and I should just keep forcing the side channels in.\nAt this stage I made a complaint and asked to be called back by a manager with Alex telling me i'm wasting my time and his supervisor will just tell me the same thing.\nAt the end of the day, the manager calls back and told me that from the photos it looks like i'm fitting them correctly and he doesn't know why they are too long or too tight. His advice was to either force them in, file them down, or send them back. I needed the blinds for that day so then spent the evening filing them down and getting them to fit myself.\nEnd result, i'm left with one damaged skylight, wasted my afternoon calling their customer services and a good hour in the evening filing down the side channels so they fit correctly. For all of that time wasted and the damage caused to my window, they offered me back my 7.95 delivery fee.\nI would avoid this company for skylight blinds. If you're unlucky and they don't fit, don't expect any help from their customer services ( and certainly don't listen to their advice if they ask you to force anything in, if this damages your windows you're on your own).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:42:48.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Items arrived, Canon compatibles. Contacted Seller who insists they did not say Canon genuine so they are right. Escalated in Paypal, no option to attach supporting documents which we wanted to forward to Paypal. So we submit anyway, confirmation stated no supporting evidence included!\nSo we searched all over Paypal help, google etc how to attach documents for transaction dispute, all directs back to same page in resolution centre with NO options given as to how to attach documents to submit.\nSo we called Paypal, went through all the 6 number coding password, pressing various number options etc until wanting to speak to someone, and we have been waiting for nearly THREE (3) hours now, listening to that dreadful music repeating over and over, still waiting!\nAn honest straight forward attempt to buy printer inks online has turned into a dreadful nightmare by a cowboy website seller and now aided by a faceless non caring corporate entity, both shrouding the small inconsequential consumer with red tape and delays with the sole intention to deter any complains.\nThis is the third occasion when I had to use Paypal to resolve claims and though two was successful, it always involves so much time and effort that negates any benefit one expects from an online purchase.\nI do hope someone else comes up with a more transparent honest system service of online payment and downgrade Paypal to obscurity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T23:14:50.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

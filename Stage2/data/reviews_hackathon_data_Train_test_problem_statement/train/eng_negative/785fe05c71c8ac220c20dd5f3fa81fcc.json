Called my aunt to see if got her Christmas present. It hadn't come she said. Well to cut this short after a lot time trying to tell this company that nothing was delivered I got a email. A woman called to say she had the parcel.\nNow I thaught we are getting somewhere. They believe me. As it's there mistake I thaught the would have picked it up and delivered it that day. O no it couldn't be done until the following day. I was asked for phone numbers for contact. They had my and my sisters but no one called. They don't use the post code for the address. Well the parcel finally reached to my aunt that evening. I was relieved that she got her Christmas present just in time. I was exhausted from the stress of it all and the time just days before Christmas that I could used to do things for my family.\nI asked to make complaint to the manager. Was told that the parcel was delivered and the matter was now closed and that person was the manager.\nShe didn't forward anything. I emailed to see what was happening. As you can imagine nothing for nearly 3 weeks. I am very disappointed as the last contact I had I was told a manager for customer services would call me. Just more wasted time waiting for a phone call. This such poor customer service. If I could have rated with a minuses ⭐️ I would have. So be warned this company feel if they deliver something for you, then they are doing you a favour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:08:34.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

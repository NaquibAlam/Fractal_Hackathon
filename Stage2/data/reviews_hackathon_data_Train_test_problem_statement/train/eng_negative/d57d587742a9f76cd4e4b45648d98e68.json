However, the videos were way too short and I found myself clicking the next button within 1 min of the video starting because it was already over.\n-There are grammatical errors within the presentation\n-Some of the quiz questions were not in the videos prior to the quiz\n-The most important info that was covered in the section was not on the quiz, instead silly no brain questions were in their place\n-Some of the quiz questions were not worded correctly and did not leave an absolute %100 definite answer\n-The course did not force the student to learn the more important items but instead reiterated the obvious.\nI truly believe that i could have received close to the required %80 without any of the prior course work because the final exam did not cover very much other than common sense. This course took an extreme amount of time for not much reward. I took it very seriously just to get to the final exam and finish it in 10 minutes. I received a %95 and i bet the questions i missed were the questions that did not have a definite answer. I think this course needs to be reviewed and some things changed so that the student actually retains the most important info. LASTLY, charging $30 for me to learn very little isn't fair. I took this course to learn and become educated, not use my common sense. I already have that and it was FREE!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:56:04.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

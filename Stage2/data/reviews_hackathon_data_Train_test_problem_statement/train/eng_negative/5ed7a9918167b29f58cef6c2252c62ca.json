I placed this order on March 17 and my script was current and already on file from my first order. Today, (March 30, 2017) I received notice that my order has shipped. I am very disappointed. It took over 3 weeks to get my first order even though I faxed my script on the day of my order. I assumed that was because it was my first order, and though I would order from OptiContacts one more time. This order is taking just as long and it is inappropriate. The price was good but I am sure I can find another company at the same price - that provides faster processing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:43:29.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

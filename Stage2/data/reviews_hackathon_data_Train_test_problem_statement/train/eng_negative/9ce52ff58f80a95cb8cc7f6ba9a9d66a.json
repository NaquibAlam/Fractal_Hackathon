Sent all informations requested in hope of solving the problem and called several time and got some rude, condescending, arrogant representatives on the phone. Requested a full refund and was told in one appalling solutions to call my bank and request a refund from them or have the same item sent to me after a month for $150 less. Note that I don't want that item anymore given all the time and disappointment that I've experienced. At this point I hope for a full credit for that item or at least a store credit. I hope we will come to a resolution without legal actions\nAshley.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:21:23.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

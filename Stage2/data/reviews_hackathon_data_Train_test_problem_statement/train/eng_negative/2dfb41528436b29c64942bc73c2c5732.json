I was told I would have them in hand on a specific date and trusted that I would. When I followed up the week prior to promised delivery date, I heard nothing back. I followed up again on the delivery date and they told me they hadn't heard back from me to confirm their proof which they claimed they sent. I went back in my email and junk mail and nothing was received for me to proof. The only thing was an email confirming receipt of jpeg and promised delivery date. Not only did they drop the ball, they lied about it. So much for customer service. I have found a new source for my customized USB that will pick up where this company dropped the ball. I would never recommend this company to anyone\nComplaint amendment - Due to the fact that I, the customer am not privy to your order protocol (that should be explained by the sales rep when the order is being placed in good faith) the response to my complaint is unacceptable. I don't believe you treat your customers well, instead lay balme on them when you mess up an order. If anyone wishes to be treated this way, then they should use your company. If they wish to order something w a sales rep, they should be directed to a website that prompts them through the ordering process. Clearly, the 'live sales rep' model doesn't work well for USB Canada. I've already ordered my replacement USBs from a company that will have them here by Friday.

After saying they wouldn't fill any of my orders anymore.... I proceeded to say \"because my dog is allergic to the food I purchased?! Really?!\" The manager on the phone just kept repeating some text book response not even caring that the return was because the food made my dog sick. Pretty messed up Won't be shopping here anymore since they disabled my account... and because their \"100% return policy\" is bogus. Thanks for nothing chewy.com and for making it even harder to purchase food my dog can actually eat and isn't ALLERGIC too", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:09:47.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Never was fixed from beginning screen was loose from day one. I sent back 3 or 4 times. Then they lost my stylus in machine supposedly.. And when i got a new 1 half the screen didnt work. Kinda fishy, also i wasted a whole night running back and forth cuz they lost my phone in their machine on one occasion. In the end i was accused of opening phone. Why i have no clue why i would do that. I been complaining the whole time and theres supposed to be a warranty and satisfaction guarantee..wrong. So i get rudely in the end accused of opening phone even tho i complaining the entire time of the loose screen. Loose edges equal broke screen. Also i dont think their glass is oem. Generic. In the end the guy said come to the store and ill call police on you. And thats that.very unprofessional and rude. I imagine a dorky kid in their moms basement fixing your phone. Do yourself a favor wait for professionals these people suck at this", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:30:55.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Towed back to work shop, diagnosed as a key problem. Instead of replacing the key, they put a new part in the old key tapped it up and told me \"it may last\" and strongly advised me to purchase a new key, then proceeded charged me $320.00 for taping a new part in an old key that won't last WHAT THE! They didn't even give me a choice to replace or repair.\nI could have purchase a new genuine key from the dealer coded to the vehicle for $338.80 how does that work....\nThe Manager of the Caboolture Branch told me he was going to call me back in 2mins with a response, I'm still waiting I did get a call from his mechanic however Very disappointed. Poor customer service skills. Shame on Lube Mobile for allowing a Person in that position who has no customer service skills to be working at your establishment.\nSeriously what kind of circus are you running???\nI would not recommend this rock show to anyone! Especially in the Caboolture area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T14:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T09:50:49.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

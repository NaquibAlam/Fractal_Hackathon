I was then told when I arrived that $200 would be held against my credit card for two weeks. Yet another piece of information that would have been nice to know in advance.\nThen to top it off I was given a car that had no damage. Yeah right. Good thing I checked it over. There were three areas I found that were damaged. All external and none of which effected the driving or safety of the car. But after being misled twice already, I wasn't taking any chances of being held accountable for something I didn't do. It made me wonder if because I declined the offer of their insurance, maybe the damage had been done y someone who did pay for insurance and they needed someone else to pin it on. I'm not saying they would have, but the mistrust I now had in them made me wonder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T23:42:30.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Are they kidding?? I have paid for a hoodie and design and embroidery to be done and if they don't do it right I have to then pay extra to fix it? They also said they wouldn't prioritise getting my order done as I didn't pay for express shipping I done standard shipping which is up to 6 days not 2 weeks later with still no final design, no hoodie and outrageous customer service!\nRefund requested and waiting to see how long that takes if at all before another complaint goes in", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T22:07:01.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

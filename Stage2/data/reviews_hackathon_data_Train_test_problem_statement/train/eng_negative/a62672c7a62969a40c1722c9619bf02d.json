About half an hour later, I was phoned by a man from Servicing Stop (although it would have taken that long to get ton the garage) to be told my car needed a long list of advisories including brake fluid change, pollen filter, engine flush... Lots of standard things. He then tried to 'do me a deal' and charge only £400 for this work (!!!).\nAfter requesting that none of this be completed and just the standard service be done, he tried to 'help me out' by asking if there was a Mr R., because 'fellas are quite good at these things'. He then tried to backtrack on these comments when he realised how sexist he sounded and continued to dig, sounding much worse.\nAfter I declined again he lost interest in being polite and quickly confirmed the price then hung up.\nLater he called back and tried to sell me the exact same services again, with the same script. When I pointed out we'd already had this conversation he then tried to sell me on MOT advisories, in a really patronising tone. He said altogether the work was £1200 plus the previous £400 that I 'needed'.\nDifferent garage Quote: d £200 for all advisories.

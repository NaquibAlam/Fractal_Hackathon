I ordered 85 wooden USB drives for my company to give out at a charity gala. I went through each and every one and found about 25 visible ones that were good quality. The rest of them were inconsistent and hardly legible. I was told by the company that laser engraving is inconsistent and they would not all look the same. That being understood, I find it odd that they wouldn't have a QC department who checked them before they were mailed out. I even asked if I could do laser and they said it would still not be consistent or reliable. Which then brings me to the point of asking why this is even being sold, or why it was not brought up as a concern before me ordering. They did offer to send it back for a refund less postage, but I had no time to get a new product before the event. I would be so ashamed to send something out that was not made right.

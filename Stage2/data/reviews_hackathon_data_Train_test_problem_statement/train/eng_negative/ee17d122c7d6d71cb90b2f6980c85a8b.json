It was sorted by itself after two, three days and I was going to talk about it with Servicing Stop, as the car was just fully serviced. In addition, they claim that they provide 12 months guarantees for their services. However, this is not the main reason of my complaint.\nThe main reason is that, in the meantime that the car had fuelling issues, I opened the bonnet and I realised that the “Top Engine Cover” is broken. So I tried to contact them several times, but they mostly did not answer the phone, or someone answered and said the manager is not available and so on. So I decided to contact them after Christmas and I did. However after numerous communications it seems that they do not accept that they have done it.\nFirstly, they said we will arrange for another collection and will sort this out for youand they booked my car to be serviced again and the engine cover to be replaced in two weeks time. They even provided me with a date a time and I stayed at home but no one turned up. Then I called them and they said it has been canceled! Without informing me!!!\nThen, they said we will have to speak to the garage that has serviced your car. It took another week and I kept contacting them everyday but they did not provided an appropriate answer. Finally I could\naccess to the manager, and she tried to resolve the issue. Finally she\ndidn’t accept the fuelling problem and did not offer me guarantee service and said fuel filter should not be changed. Regarding the engine cover she asked me to get a Quote: from Mercedes and I did. I sent the Quote: to them and finally she said No, the garage does not accept that they have done the damage. I ALSO TOLD THEM THAT THEY HAVE NOT DONE ANY CHECK ON COLLECTION TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY DAMAGE ON THE CAR, ALSO THEY HAVE NOT DONE THIS WHEN THEY RETURNED THE VEHICLE, SO THAT THEY CANNOT SAY THIS DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE BY YOURSELF, while other companies normally have a checklist and have a look at everything and sign\nthe checklist by both parties on collection and delivery date. But they said we will not compensate and you can ask for other parties to help you in this matter!!!\nI even gave them final chance to resolve the issue informally by sending them another email but they said we will not be changing our position.\nSo I ended up with a broken engine cover, fueling problem, and absolutely annoyed. In addition, the certificate of service that they have provided is a very dirty, and unacceptable paper, which has not ticked anything, so I am not sure if they have even checked or replaced the air filter, oil, etc...\nPLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR SERVICING YOUR CAR.\nYOU WILL PAY TO A COMPANY TO DAMAGE YOUR CAR AND BRING IT BACK FOR YOU...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:23:00.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

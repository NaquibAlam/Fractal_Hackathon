Found out this morning they cancelled my order \"at my request\"! I e-mailed to find out what was going on. They did e-mail me on a Thursday asking for a room or house number, which is weird because I have never needed one when ordering anywhere else! My order should have been processed. They replied with a \"Hi...\" (what professional company uses an ellipses like that?) and told me they e-mailed me asking about the address. They couldn't even proper time before cancelling my order \"at my request\". Sorry I didn't e-mail them back during my grandmother's funeral. I simply replied with a \"Nope.\" at reordering, to which the company replied back with a \"Nope.\" as well. Don't know what that's supposed to mean... Petty, petty.

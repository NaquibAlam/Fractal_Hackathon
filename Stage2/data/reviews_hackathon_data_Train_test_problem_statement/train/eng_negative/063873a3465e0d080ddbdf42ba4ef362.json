Since I live in the US it would make no sense for me to keep the tickets. I wanted to get a refund for my tickets. When you look on the website there is no phone number listed to receive the refund and there is nothing in the email to state about a refund. i have sent countless emails to the website to receive some type of information and i have yet to get a phone call or response. This website feels like a scam and i just lost all my money and all I want is my money back. I am definitely going to social media and promote that this is not a good website to use. The customer service is horrible. How do you not have anyone who is in the chat. then when you try to look for someone is says no one is there. I am beyond fed up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T06:14:25.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

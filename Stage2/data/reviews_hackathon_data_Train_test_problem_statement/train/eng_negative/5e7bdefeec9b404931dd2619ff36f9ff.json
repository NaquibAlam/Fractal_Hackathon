(Was a gift.) They never told me, then called a day later and left a giggly and slightly incoherent message to call them back. I did so within 5 minutes of receiving their call but they left early for a long holiday weekend. When I finally did get ahold of a person the following week, they notified me of the hold. I said since there was no problem with the shipping address, they had no business holding the item. Since it was a gift, I asked that the item be expedited. The man on the phone did so, and told me the item would by a specific date. It did not. Two days after the date he told me, I called back. He put me on hold for 20 minutes to look up the shipping and never came back to say he was still looking into it. Just dead silence. Will never do business with Dior again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:04:30.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

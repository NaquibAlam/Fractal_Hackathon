I'm currently stranded overseas with no return flight because of a mistake they made. The only way they will work on the change is if I pay an additional $400 after my ticket has already cost me $2500. They won't admit to their mistake and are trying to put tge blame on me. Not to mention I have spent the last 16 hours on and off the phone with them only to tell my story 8 times, being told they were going to do something about it and call me back and then not call me back. Then I called back and l was back in my original position of them not doing anything. WORST COMPANY EVER. They have lied to me about them sending me emails, each person I talk to gives me a different story and they have told me that there is no one higher in the company to deal with and then hung up on me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:39:55.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

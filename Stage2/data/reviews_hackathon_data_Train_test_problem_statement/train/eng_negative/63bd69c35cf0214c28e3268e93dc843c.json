We were unable to process your credit card. I got a different credit card, flight I wanted was no longer available so I went with a completely different company and airline. Then Flight Hub proceeded to take my money out and I got an email two weeks later saying your flight has been booked and your card was charged 141.40. The next day after I \"tried\" to book it, I used my card and only had 2 dollars on it but the charges and email didn't show up until two days ago. I had to borrow money to get groceries and gas before I left town, was short money I needed to pay a couple bills, was in tears on my vacation stressing about costs and hadn't flown or taken a trip in years but did so for my best friend of 30 years wedding. When I contacted Flight Hub, the guy was rude, kept saying well obviously your credit card DID go through and we will not refund your money. I contacted my credit card company, sent them the emails I received from Flight Hub and formally filed to dispute the claim and will be contacting the Better Business Bureau. This was an absolutely horrible and costly experience for me I will tell all my family and friends NOT to use Flight Hub!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:08:53.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

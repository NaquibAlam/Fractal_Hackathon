So on the window of delivery, I get an email saying they still had not received the item from the warehouse so it hadn't bee dispatched yet. That I would get it the next week. I was then given a new window to expect delivery. Again, on the date I was supposed to receive the item, I get an email saying they still had not receive the item yet!! What had I paid $30 USD in delivery for??\nThey gave me an option to continue waiting with no real idea of when delivery would be made or a refund. I took the refund, after waiting for two weeks for an item they clearly never had in the first place. I lost out on the exchange rate too when they refunded me as well.\nIn addition to getting these emails about the delay, I did email them up to five times to ask about the product specification, a simple question, yet each them they would just answer something about delivery, and not the product question, then on the last email reply when I had asked them the 4th time to answer the question about my product, they got rather rude, didn't answer the question and just asked if I wanted the item delivered or not (when it became available).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T13:02:42.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

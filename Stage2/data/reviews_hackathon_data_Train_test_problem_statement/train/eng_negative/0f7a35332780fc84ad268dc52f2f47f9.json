We ordered a baby seat from Redspot. At the checkin desk at the airport we were handed the baby seat and told to fit it to the car ourselves. We then walked to the car park (some distance away with our trolley of luggage pram, porta cot and now baby seat only to find the car seat was already in there. Now we were stuck with a second seat we had to take all the way back to the terminal. I had a very tired little boy who was hungry and crying. I then had to juggle my baby while reading instructions on how to fit a car seat in New Zealand while my mother went to find help and return the second car seat. All at 6.00pm at night. Anyone with a small child would understand the stress of this situation. If I was travelling alone I think I would have been stuck there unable to hold my baby and fit a car seat at the same time. Every other company we rented off during our holiday fitted these car seats for us. If travelling with children I highly recommend another company. Also the 12volt charger did not work. This was very inconvenient for phone charging.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:33:12.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

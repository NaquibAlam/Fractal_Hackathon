I still have yet to receive them. I have received 2 emails requesting a review. How can I? I need my contacts!\nUpdate:\nThey said they sent an email that said my contacts were on \"back order\" and there would be a delay, but I never received such an email. I have had no communication of the expected delivery date until I wrote this review. If I was told it was going to be this long, I would have cancelled my order. It has now been 2 weeks and 3 days. They said they expect my order to arrive tomorrow, then they have to ship it to my house. I expect it will be at least 3 weeks, possibly more until I receive the contacts?

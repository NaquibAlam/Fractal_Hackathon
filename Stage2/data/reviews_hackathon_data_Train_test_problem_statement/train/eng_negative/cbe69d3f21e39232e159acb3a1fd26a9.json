I am unsure as of to why. The only thing I can figure is maybe the transition lenses with the thin lenses made it difficult to see. I noticed while wearing the glasses I have a hard time focusing and absolutely can not drive with them. I have another pair with the same prescription so I know that isn't the reason. I looked into returning them but the policy states they would only refund 50% of the lenses and that I had to pay for shipping and handling. I personally think that is ridiculous and don't even want to go through that trouble again. It took so long to receive them in the first place. I will just take them to a local place and have new lenses replaced and suck up the costs. I learned my lesson. I'm never buying glasses online again. Too much uncertainty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:07:53.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I called to express my dissatisfaction and was on hold for over 28 minutes. They didn't know what went wrong and couldn't give a good explanation - no one understands anything there! They offered a $20 discount for my next order and I told them there will NOT be a next order I just wanted the right ordered delivered. Then they said they would deliver the correct order and pick up the order that wasn't right. I told them no way. The person that I had the flowers send to was recuperating from surgery and could NOT be playing their exchange game. I got so disgusted, I hung up. I will be contacting my bank to cancel payment if possible. Please do NOT order from Ava's flowers!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:22:37.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I did receive conformation from them and also from Pay Pal that my account had been charged. On January 18, I received an email from Jessica Stone. She writes,\n\"My name is Jessica Stone and I am the Assistant Director of Sales for Lymphedema Products. I have noticed that this is your first online order with us and I just wanted to take this opportunity to introduce myself to you. Lymphedema Products has been proudly serving customers for over 15 years and if there is anything I can do for you in the future I am only an e-mail or phone call away. Lymphedema Products sells a wide variety of compression therapy products including custom sized garments and custom bandaging alternatives. Please don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any questions or concerns.\"\nI thought that was nice but I never received any kind of shipment notice or tracking number. After 9 days I was curious why I had not received my order so I called the toll free number and spoke to a representative of \"L-P\" and gave him my order number. He placed me on hold while he checked. He came back briefly and said he had contacted Juzo (fulfillment company sending the stocking) and said they were looking for the order and again placed me on hold. Three of four songs played through while I'm waiting on hold and finally he comes back on and said he apologized for placing me on hold for so long but he asked for confirmation of my phone number and said he would call me back shortly with information. That call with an explanation as to what happened never came. The next day I had an email from \"L-P\". It stated:\n\"We thought you'd like to know your order 144497 has shipped:\"\nIt included the Fed Ex shipment Tracking number.\nWith no further communications with \"L-P\", I can only assume that my original order was lost and after my contacting them they placed a new order which shipped on Friday after my call about the delay. For this reason I can not offer a recommendation to Lymphedema Products. It will be Monday before Fed Ex delivers my package. I just hope it is correct.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T13:12:00.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

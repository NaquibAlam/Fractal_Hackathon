How can they claim to be No1 Online Florist, when Prestige Flowers have FAILED to deliver my order, they FAILED to answer my emails, you’ve FAILED to reply to my Live Chat enquiry (which by the way is NOT a Live Chat Feature!) and they FAILED to offer me any kind of compensation?\nI ordered this bunch of flowers to be delivered on February 8th, paid for Next Day Delivery (BEFORE 9pm on the 7th), I received an email confirming the delivery date - but they have NOT arrived. I’ve confirmed with the reception at the delivery address that NOTHING has been delivered, but yet the Customer Service representative claimed that the courier says they’ve been delivered! How is this possible? Why are they using such unreliable couriers? Why aren’t my flowers delivered on time as both the website and the email I received claimed they would be?\nI was on hold for 15 minutes TWICE before my call to Prestige Flowers was answered and I found Customer Services thoughtless and so without empathy that it drove me to frustration - she didn’t sound like she cared and was merely repeating the a scripted apology! Claiming it is a \"busy time” and orders may not arrive is NOT an excuse! If Prestige Flowers can’t deliver the product because they are unable to handle a certain amount of orders, they shouldn’t accept more orders, and Prestige Flowers certainly shouldn’t take the not insignificant sum of money from customers if they know they can’t fulfil orders either!\nIt’s not my fault (or interest) that your courier has failed you - but that is not my problem…but Prestige Flowers have effectively taken money for something you can’t deliver…literally!\nPrestige Flowers claim that you are going to start an investigation - I fail to see how that is going to help me when the delivery date has passed and they have FAILED to deliver the promised delivery! So I have effectively paid for something that I’ve not received, so I require a refund ASAP!\nPrestige Flowers Service and Customer Service is a joke (two emails, broken Live Chat, 2x 30 minute phone call, with NO adequate response!)…you’ve failed the most basic task that a florist should do. Offering me a measly refund of £4.80 on a bunch of flowers that cost me nearly £50 is frankly insulting in the extreme! ‘Raising’ an investigation is of absolutely zero use to me, when the promised flowers have NOT been delivered to my fiancé on the day required.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:50:28.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

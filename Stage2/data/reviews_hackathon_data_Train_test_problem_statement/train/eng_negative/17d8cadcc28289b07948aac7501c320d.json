I was trying to buy stuff online and kept on getting errors during check out. I would have tried at least 10 times( visa checkout as well as regular checkout). i called customer service and i was told there are issues and i should try back. the 35$ offer will still be honored. Again i tried after 2 days and still same issues. I gave up.\nI tried again today , it worked but no 35$ offer.I would have saved good amount. but i don;t understand how can the website have issues for so many days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:46:13.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

She then took it to PayPal and that's when the trouble started, I gave them every bit of information required and even told them I had cctv footage of the courier mishandling the item but was told they couldn't accept it, she returned less than half the items ( but kept the ones that was not broken) so all I got back was a box of broken items, PayPal was not interested in this so they gave her a full refund and wasn't bothered about the fact she kept most of the items, leaving me with nothing re sellable, lost all my items and they charged me Â£99.99 for the privilege, NEVER again am I using there so called services, they will only rip you off in the end", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:12:40.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

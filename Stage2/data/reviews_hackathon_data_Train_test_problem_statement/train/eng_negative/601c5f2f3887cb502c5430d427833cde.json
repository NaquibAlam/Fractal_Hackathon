I purchased some downloadable content for which i needed it for the next day. Their servers was down so i could not download my purchased items. As I couldn't receive my download i had to go else ware and therefor i did not need them any more. I asked for a refund and they replied by totally ignore my question for a refund and said our servers are down you can no download. I then replied can i have a refund as i do not need the product anymore. I had no response for about a week so i made a claim through paypal, Which sparked the attention and they replied from Frank B at envanto \"\nFrank B (Envato Market Help)\nMar 4, 11:15 AEDT\nThank you for writing back.\nI apologize for the delay in our response. It appears that you have already filed a dispute with PayPal which has inadvertently locked your account (lie). I would be happy to help you with your refund but since I am unable to access your account (lie they just have to press a button), you will need to cancel the dispute first so that we can proceed with the refund (absolutely atrocious LIE LIE LIE!!). If you decide to cancel the dispute, simply write back to us and we would be happy to assist you further.\" so i did this and they did not give me a refund even after saying they did. By cancelling the claim i lost my seller protection which meant they do not have to give me a refund after speaking to paypal and did this to mislead me. Which was completely unacceptable. I will never shop with them again and would insist no one else does if they like to purchase from honest companies unlike this one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:14:40.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

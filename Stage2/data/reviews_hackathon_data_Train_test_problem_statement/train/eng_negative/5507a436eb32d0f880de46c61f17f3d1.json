Got text Wednesday to say it had been delivered. Went in on Thursday and they told me top had been given to wrong person and they would ring me when other customer dropped it back. Went in Friday and was told by one of the staff \"I didn't ring you\"!! Top was not in. Was told it would be Saturday. Went in on Saturday evening and was told the lady hadn't dropped it back. Asked for my money back and was asked immediately for the receipt by a staff member with her hand out at me despite me being in the shop every day last week looking for top. Felt the staff didn't care about me even though they caused the problem and i was just annoying them every time i went in. I know the shop is closing on Thursday and it seems they just don't care about customers.

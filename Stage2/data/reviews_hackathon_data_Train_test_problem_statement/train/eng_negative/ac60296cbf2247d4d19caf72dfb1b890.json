It has taken me a while to get my project truck back together and I tried to install them today and they don't fit, not even close. They have a +1 offset and I need at least and -20 offset. I just got off the phone with Justin and he said because of the lapsed time, no matter if his guy sold me the wrong product that he wasn't going to fix their mistake and there was nothing he was going to do about it. RIDICULOUS I will never buy any more parts for my trucks from here ever again Do yourself a favor and order from someone who cares!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:39:18.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

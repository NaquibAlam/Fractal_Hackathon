Therefore I find myself going to the mountains in February without winter tires, snow chains and ski-rack. The rental company (Enterprise in Lyon) have confirmed that they never have received the request and that I it had been requested, they would have had all the equipment. Really bad experience and Argus just says there is nothing they can do about it. I feel really helpless.\nIf they find another car from another rental office (at a higher price) I will have to pay the difference. Not fair, since I booked well in advance and now all cars are between 32-400% above the price I booked at. Their suggestion was that I cancelled my reservation and got another one.

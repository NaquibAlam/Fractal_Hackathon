Regardless of Trust Pilots own policies, their compliance team does not abide by them. In other words, your customers can write lies and name competitors in their reviews and Trust Pilot's compliance team will not remove them even after you've proven the lie. This is a clear contradiction of Trust Pilots guidelines and they simply don't abide by them.\nResponse to Your Response:\nThank you for the reply. I’d like to point out as a customer, I have the right to review Trust Pilot based on the service experience. Part of Trust Pilot’s service experience is the User Guidelines they/you chose to operate by. With that said, I don’t agree with the Guidelines and/or at least the way they are written. Secondly, I’m confident your compliance team is either not following the Guidelines or using poor discretion at a minimum.\nFurthermore, most if not all of the guidelines are written speaking to the customer, not the business. This means, as a business disputing a review, I have to read through sections and think of the experience as if I was in a reverse roll in order to figure out what compliance actually means. Example: Title of paragraph: “When do we ask you to change your review”. That particular paragraph speaks directly to a customer that is going to leave a review. There aren’t any paragraphs that are titled: When is a good time to dispute a customer review. See the difference? We’re a business, but you’re sending us Guidelines that are entirely worded as if we’re the customer leaving the review.\nHere are some direct Quote: s from Trust Pilot’s guidelines:\nSection 5.2 on Asking to Change a Review:\nFirst Bullet Point: “Your review contains language that ….. includes defamatory statements…”\nThird Bullet Point: “The content of your review appears to be solely concerned with … value-laden opinion, as opposed to a Service Experience”\nSection 6 on Review Removal:\nOpening Paragraph (shows you have discretion IMO): “…we reserve the right to remove reviews that we determine violate these Guidelines…” “… Examples of when we may remove your review include, but are not limited to:”\nThird Bullet Point: “Your review doesn't appear to be based on a genuine Service Experience (e.g. it is a fabricated review, see clause 11 below)”\nFrom Clause 11: First Paragraph/Opening Statement: Our aim is to create and maintain a best-in-class online review community where you can freely share your Service Experiences with the Company and thereby provide an informative and fair view of the Company's services.\nThird Paragraph of Clause 11: “…We have a zero-tolerance policy against fabricated reviews. … we cannot under any circumstances accept fabricated reviews. This includes reviews that are not an expression of a genuine Service Experience…”\nFifth Paragraph of Clause 11: …” Reviews that we deem false, fabricated or similar will be removed..”\nNote: “Deem False + fabricated or similar”, once again shows you can use discretion.\nI recognize that our Service Rating is in the mid 9’s and overall our ratings are awesome on Trust Pilot. With that said, when a customer flat out lies and makes it public information through your platform, we’re going to put up some resistance as you would do the same if we spread lies about Trust Pilot. That is public information that could receive 100’s or 1000’s of view over time. Trust Pilot’s disclaimer to not get involved with “cases of true/untrue course of events” would be understandable in some scenarios that can not be proven, however, in our instances of “disputing”, we’ve only disputed lies, false statements, defamatory statements, value-laden opinions, that are clear as day and easily proven to be false without doubt. Your disclaimer is weak compared to the repetitive statements regarding Trust Pilots desire for “genuine” reviews and keeping fabrication off the platform. Until there is clarification within your Guidelines, my opinion stands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T11:06:12.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

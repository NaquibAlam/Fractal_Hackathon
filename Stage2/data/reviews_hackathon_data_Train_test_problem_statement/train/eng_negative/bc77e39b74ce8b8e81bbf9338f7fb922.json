I unboxed my easy vape 5 digital and set it up according to instructions I found on youtube. The heating element did not heat up and glow red. I inspected the unit to find a hairline Crack in the heating element. I called Vape Nation immediately to report it and get a solution. I was told that I would have to ship it back, it would be inspected, and either repaired or replaced. I was told that it would take about 2 days for a shipping label to be emailed to me then when It arrives at Vape Nation it could be a couple of weeks before they could send another or the repaired item. I have still not gotten an email with a shipping label and have an item that is useless to me. I am very disappointed in the service from Vape Nation. I feel like I am now out the money I spent, have a useless product, & have been disregarded in any attempt to make this right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T19:15:17.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

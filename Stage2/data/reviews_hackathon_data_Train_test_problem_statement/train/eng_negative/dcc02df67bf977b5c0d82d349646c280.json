The pictures shown on Avas Flowers website are not even close to the actual flowers you receive. They are in business to collect orders and then broker them to local flower shops. I ordered a specific flower shown on their website, and then received a call shortly after placing the order saying the flowers were not available and they asked if I was ok with receiving a beautiful replacement. I asked what the replacement flower would be and they started dancing around the question. They offered me discounts on my next order, or \"farm fresh\" flowers shipped later, but could not tell me what the replacement flower would be. I asked if they could call the local flower shop to confirm what the options would be before I made my decision. They repeated the script for discounts and farm fresh flowers. I asked them to cancel my order since they were unable to provide the goods and services that they sold me, and that's when I was told I would have to pay $13.99 to cancel my order. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that they were all too busy to take my call. After hours of hold time and several phone calls, their cancelation department agreed that I would not be charged. Avas Flowers in my opinion is a bad business and I would not recommend anyone to purchase flowers from them. In the end I called a local flower shop, asked if they dealt with Avas. They said no, and suggested that I search for Avas Flowers on social media to get better feedback regarding the company. Do not let the ratings on Avasflowers.com fool you. I have contacted my bank to dispute the charges that were supposed to be canceled.\nAfter writing a negative review with Trustpilot my review was removed by Ava's Flowers by stating I was not a customer. By providing my order number to Trustpilot, hopefully my review is posted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:08:44.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

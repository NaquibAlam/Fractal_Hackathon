With my order I received a 10% discount code to buy from their parent company (same products) Premier Products Ltd.\nAs I wanted some more mats I tried to order from the Premier Products site but this is a total nightmare and nowhere near as slick. When ordering the rubber mats it does not give you the option to select other patteren options as does the Car Mats site. After placing my order I quickly contacted Premier Products to verify the rubber finish I required anad after 3 days the customer services manager responded by saying if they arrived wrong they would rectify the problem.\nGreat I thought but when they did arrive as not expected I contacted customer services again but my emails were totally ignored so now I have to live with the mat's rubber pattern.\nI'm sure Car Mats will come back with the usual response of phone their customer services number but if they cannot respond to an email then I don't see the point.\nSo buying from Car Mats was a pleasant experience, Premier Products which are in effect the same company are just too much like hard work and so is best to avoid their web site.\nI have never received any emails from you!!\nAs I said previously emails totally ignored!!\nWell I followed Car Mats advice as instructed in their response to my review and all I can say is their customer service is useless.\nYes they make all the right noises on here when responding to a bad review but then never follow it through and just ignore you.\nUse these people at your own risk because if a problem arises then you are stuffed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:43:11.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

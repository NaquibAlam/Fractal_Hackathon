The rep I spoke with was only able to refund 4 out of the 5 charges, leaving me with a $49 balance to use... I do not care to purchase more from this company, and now I have to call back to actually cancel, because he said that if we canceled at the time of the refund, it could \"complicate the process\"...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:20:57.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

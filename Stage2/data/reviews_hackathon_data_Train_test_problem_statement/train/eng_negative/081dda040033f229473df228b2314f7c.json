You had to phone, couldn't alter that online. Then the health questions against the partner who is on what most people are on at that age. Couldn't answer so phoned up the health number who they off shute this too. They decided it was going to cost an additional £250 this year. Err. Then said could remove one condition. It's still about the same. What about removing both conditions. No additional cost. They were keen to take the money until we wanted to drop the additional conditions then it was back to the main number, being a Sunday closed.\nSo clearly the additional medical insurance people who have those average conditions for that age are scammed and the insurance is wacked up. The guy on the phone could have said no additional cost if you exclude those conditions or with the conditions £250 extra. He didn't.\nGoing to look around next year since the basic insurance premium shot up and all of this was on expensive telephone numbers. So not happy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T15:41:20.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

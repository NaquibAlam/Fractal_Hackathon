Then you don't inform your customers that your site is Canadian based and they will be paying at a Canadian exchange rate.My bank charges an $8 US fee for international purchases. So unsuspecting customers are charged the prices in US then its converted at a Canadian exchange rate AFTER THEIR PAYMENT IS PROCESSED, AND THEIR CREDIT CARD IS CHARGED MORE. It is only after you see your itinerary or you get a notice from you bank of the purchase you realise you are charged more. I ended up paying more than some of the other sites charged.\nMy tickets initially cost $1086.00, after the credit card fees were added came up to $1121.06, and then after being charged at a Canadian exchange rate the final cost is now $1142.27 an excess of $56.27, Other sites charge less than the $1142.27 I paid for the 2 ticketst.I must say i'm disappointed. you have just lost a frequent flying customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:52:10.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

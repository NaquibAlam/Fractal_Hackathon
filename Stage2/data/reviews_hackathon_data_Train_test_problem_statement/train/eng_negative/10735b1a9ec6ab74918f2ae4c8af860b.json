After 4 weeks of waiting, I was told it was in and ready to be picked-up. I drove down to get it, only to find out that it was never actually there, and was not even on it's way. The manager at the time did everything in his power to \"make it right\" - after another 4-weeks he found my couch at another location and had it delivered to my house for free to make-up for it.\n3 weeks ago, I figured \"why not\" give American Freight another chance. So I went and purchased a BLUE love-seat from the same location. I was told to call back in about 2-weeks to see if it was ready for pick-up. I followed up like I was told to, and the guy on the phone said my couch was not in yet, but should be in another week, which I was fine with. Then, a couple days later, the manager calls me asking how I like my new RED love-seat. I tell him I haven't picked it up, and that it was supposed to be a Blue model, to which he seemed utterly shocked. He told me he would go to the back to check for it, because he was sure he had seen it back there - but he took the phone with him and I heard him ask the back room employees \"Hey, I am looking for the Blue Eclipse Loveseat, Model # for my customer on the phone,\" and all the employees began laughing.\nThe manager got back on the line with me and told me he would call me back and quickly hung up.\nNot a great way to end a call - me hearing people laughing at my, now second, missing couch - and then being hung up on. P.S. It's been almost 2-days since then and I still haven't gotten a call back to update me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T14:47:23.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Received email on day after scheduled delivery. I made the call back and the person that answered had such a bad attitude. Supplier (Maine Lobster Now) claimed they tried to call me but no record of such a call. He acted as if it was my fault that they did not deliver the product on time. Lobsters arrived 2 days late and DEAD! Product was probably packed and set for 2 days before shipping.\nPaid premium price for product for poor product and service. Costly mistake on my part when I used Maine Lobster Now. Never again!\nI am sure there are other good suppliers available so I will not use Maine Lobster Now again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:54:42.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

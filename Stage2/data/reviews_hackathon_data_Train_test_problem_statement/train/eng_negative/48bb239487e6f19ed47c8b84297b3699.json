A couple days ago I used it for about an hour, and when I was turning it off I was told that I had used 487mb in that session. Immediately after that I went to my ISP's internet page, opened my personal office's section and found out that I had used 380mb in the last 24hrs. How can this be? There's no sence for\nmy ISP to lie to me since I have Unlimited Access plan, and figures are given just to inform me. There's sence for Windscribe to cheat me that I exaust my free monthly 50gb quicker and stop loading their servers, or even better buy a subscription. Previously, I also noticed several times that Windscribe traffic statistics were strangely high. If Windscribe\nisn't honest in smaller things, which I believe is the case, how can you trust them at alll?\nYesterday I accidentally deleted my e-mail from the Windscribe account, and my limit dropped to 2gb/month. I tried to restore things and re-entered the e-mail. Was told I'd receive a confirmation message.\nAfter waiting for 13 hours filled a ticked. This is what I got back, copy-pasted: \"Just letting you know that we received your support request, its quite excellent, one of the best ones we've seen, good job!\"\nThere was nothing special about my support request and the way I put it, so these words are mockery. On one hand, I'm not surprised, because I'm a free user. On the other, I'm shocked at how shamelessly ugly customers are treated, paid or free. I believe Windscribe to be a lousy, cheating, rude company. Who knows who they share your personal data with.

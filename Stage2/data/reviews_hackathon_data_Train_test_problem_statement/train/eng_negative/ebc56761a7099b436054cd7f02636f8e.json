Manager, said that they need to run reset the laptop again to find the problem and that was the only way, hiwever I was strongly asking for refund and only agreed for them to run this test for their sakes. And you know what happened and I only found that out later in a few weeks since I am not the big master in all this softwares and hardwares, instead of looking for the problem while running this test, they deactivated my Radeon graphics card and only left me with Intel card not so powerful performance that's why I was wondering that when I was watching movies the quality was so bad and I was wondering why; also on my Radeon graphics card settings they have changed many things like they put some kind of block on that I could only use powersaving on my internet browser while browsing internet so that I cant even change it to high performance setting so that i couls use the full power of my Radion graphics card. Basically instead of ffinding the problem, they blocked all the possible ways for the potential problem to come from the Radeon card. And I was wondering, manager was so sure when he was saying that the problem would not come back again and now I f...ing know why it would not come back.

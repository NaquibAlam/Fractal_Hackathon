The key that was received did not work. It would not even go into the keyhole. I called customer service and was able to explain the situation. I sent them a picture of the key they had sent me and pictures of the lock face. They sent out a new key that day overnight with the explanation that the key should have been double sided. When I received the new key the next day, it also would not work.\nCustomer service was not helpful when I called back to complain and would not refund my shipping fees. They would only refund the key charges. I felt that this was not a good business practice as their product totally failed. They should have covered the entire expense. I asked to speak to a manager and the rep asked me to hold then came back on the line to tell me a manger said they can not refund the shipping.\nThe whole experience was disappointing at best. I feel that the company should have been more willing to work with me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T09:35:20.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

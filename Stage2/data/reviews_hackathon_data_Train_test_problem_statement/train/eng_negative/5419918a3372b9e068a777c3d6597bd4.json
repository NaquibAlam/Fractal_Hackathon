We flew into Oslo on Dec 23rd and stayed in Oslo until the 26th. Oslo was completely closed Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. They should have recommended that we fly directly to Tromso as the tours there all run over the holiday. Then we went to kirkeness to stay at the snow hotel and go king crab fishing. They scheduled our king crab fishing the evening we arrived, however, upon arrival we were told that included with the cost of our room in the snow hotel was a gourmet meal that we would miss because of the tour. We asked if we could reschedule our tour for the next morning being that the flights they scheduled for us were not until 8:30 pm and we had nothing scheduled but it was fully booked. So we missed the dinner and spent the entire next day hanging around the lounge in the hotel. We wanted to stay in a snow room at the hotel, but no one explained to us that they kick you out of the room at 7 am. We probably would have opted to not stay there had we known that fact. The trip was sadly poorly organized to maximize our time there. There must be a tour company that knows Norway better then them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:16:07.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

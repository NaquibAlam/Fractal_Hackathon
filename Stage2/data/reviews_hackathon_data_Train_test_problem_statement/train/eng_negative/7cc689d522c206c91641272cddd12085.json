I was that stupid to pay such amount in hopes for a well functioning Product without headaches. Guess what! The mac started behaving weird after about three weeks. It started freezing and it only got worse and as I write this review, it's completely dead now. I have been in tears on phone explaining the problem to apple, I have spent time/days and weeks worth more than the price of the iMac - trying to troubleShoot the issue. After about 12 months in agony I told them this must end now so I need to annul the purchase and buy another computer as my family couldn't live like this anymore. It was at this point that they reffered me to a local repair shop. I carried the heavy machine to the store who retained it for about a week and yet the problem wasn't fixed properly. Apple has trained their workers to act like robots. There're no human understanding or feelings of any kind at all. All you get is a very sweet \"hooker-like\" lovely voice who starts the conversation in a way as if they understand your problem but all you get is; \"I can see you've been having the problem for a long time now, I'll do my best to help you now. I'll be the one to deal with this from now onwards. I'll call you back...\". On the other hand I even got a response like: \"we've never got any complaints from anyone before. Even if you know of any complaint then it's a drop in the ocean compared to how much we sell without any complaints\". My screen completely failed and turned black three days ago. I called in crying for help. I received the usual robot-like response saying the problem is a bit too complicated so they would have to hear the opinion of the engineers who made the software and whole design of the iMac then they'd give me a call back latest the following day, which was yesterday but one, but no one has called me back yet and we're at the end of third day. There's no cooperation with Apple. Once they've got your money for their overly priced products, you're on your own. Apple really sucks when it comes to after-sales services including customer care. As said, the \"sweet\" telephone voice only works when the issue is easily fixable. Otherwise those who give more than one star in review of apple would regret it badly. Now all I have to do is to file a complain to the consumer board authority and this may take all from six months to one year. So where does it leave me? I am forced to go and invest in a new computer while waiting for the case to be handled. Apple is not even moved by this message from me. Shocking indeed how a company of this size can treat people like crap while strapping us of millions! NEVER BUY APPLE products unless you're sure it'll work throughout the duration you expect to own it or unless you have too much money that you don't care about losing! Because you will never see that money again if the product fails. I mean NEVER!! You lose in all ways. In my case, I have already lost more than what I paid for the product , so even if I win the case with the consumer board, I'll never recover the time spent chasing for it, the headache along the way, the documents lost during troubleshooting and reinstalling the computer, the daily growing frustrations, etc. I have lost big time!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T15:18:39.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

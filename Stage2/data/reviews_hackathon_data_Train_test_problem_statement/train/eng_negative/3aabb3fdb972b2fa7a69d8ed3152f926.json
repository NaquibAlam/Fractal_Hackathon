When I further inquired about what kind of \"rough condition\" it was in, I was given a non specific generalized response and all but ignored. Also, they advertise how quick they can give you money for selling your books but it took them over a MONTH to send me the check for the books they did accept. Overall, they had terrible customer service and seemed more like a scam than anything else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T09:27:04.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

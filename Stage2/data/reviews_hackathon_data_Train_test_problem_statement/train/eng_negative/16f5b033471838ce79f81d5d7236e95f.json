When I booked and paid for the room 4 weeks before my arrival date I was told that this motel accepted pets and that there was no extra charge. When I arrived I discovered this was not the case. The room had to be changed and there was an extra 20.00 charge for my 2 pets. The person booking the room for me should have known the pet policy.

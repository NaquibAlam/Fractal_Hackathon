I assumed it will be the same value replacement, as their Policy\n\" substitutions of items of equal or greater value will be necessary \"\nI received 7 stems of Gerbera for £34 their illustrated Gerbera (Premium) bouquet contains 16 stems for £33!\nSo in reality I had less then half of the flowers! I sent them a photo of the delivered bouquet, confirming it (mini/standard Gerbera was sent!!!).\nChecked with local Florist (£1 a stem ) and recipient Country Florist ( less than 1€ a stem) to confirm the price of the Mini and Standard Gerbera is the same price, just in case that is their excuse!\nTheir argument is, Original order 6 stems, replacement 6 stems!\nI e-mailed them to ask a question, If I ordered 16 stems of Gerbera and they had to substitute it for the Chrysanthemums, would it be 16 stems\nOf course there is no answer from them!!\nThose people, who gave 5* reviews, probably don't see a photo of the delivered flowers!\nLets face it, if someone sends me flowers, I will say thank you it was lovely!\nI won't say by the way! It contained 6 stems etc!!!\nSo think before you order from Floraqueen!

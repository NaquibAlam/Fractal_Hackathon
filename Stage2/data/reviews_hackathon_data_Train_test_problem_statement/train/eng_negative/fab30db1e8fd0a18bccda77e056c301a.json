They place your bad reviews first and then don't recommend the good reviews. They posted 3 negative reviews and I had 25 good reviews that were not recommended. This is a dishonest company from the CEO down. I am sure he has a family and he raises his kids the way he runs this company, they will be good criminals like their father. At one point in our lives, we are forced to look at who we really are and if not at this life, then the next and I am sure the CEO won't like it because it is hot there.\nEveryone, see what is happening here with Yelp and start blogging and opening websites about them to expose their extortion and who these people really are. I know that I am because I am growing weary of their nonsense, lies, schemes, manipulations and dishonesty. Please, stay away from these people and don't trust their reviews.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:54:54.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

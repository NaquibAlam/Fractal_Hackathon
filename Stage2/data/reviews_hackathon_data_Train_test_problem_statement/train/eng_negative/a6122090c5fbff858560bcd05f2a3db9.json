Didn't mark each scratch since NEVER EVER was a car company so nasty about checking. We just marked big visible scratches we could see in the DARK parking lot. No colleague of yours came to assist. When I mentioned that the car has lots of scratches your colleague at the desk just insisted me to sign it.\nWhen we returned the car, your colleagues checked it under bright light marking every piece of crap that we didn't even consider scratch just dirt / wasn't possible to see in the parking lot. We were charged 940 euros for the \"damage\". It feels like a big scam to me since there was no assistance when we had to mark, the guy was very very thorough and also your computer miraculously had only those marks registered that I showed.\nWe already contacted the ECC - European Customer Centres, the Consumer's Office of the Basque Government, I will keep on posting on Twitter, Facebook, TripAdvisor, RentaCar.com and all major social media platforms if you don't revise your unfair decision and don't take our cause with attention and JUSTICE. My next step will be to escalate this to legal action.\nContract ID: EU12063886-1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:20:35.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

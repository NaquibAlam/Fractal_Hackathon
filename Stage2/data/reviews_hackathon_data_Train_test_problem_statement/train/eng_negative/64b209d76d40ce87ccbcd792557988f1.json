As I went to take the tickets off the site it glitched and someone had bought the tickets stopping me from doing so. I emailed requesting not to see but they gave me an air bill of $100 for cancellation which I understand and am happy with but I received another bill of $213.40 stating that I have to pay For the buyers ticket equal or better to mine as stated in the T&C, my seats were no where near that price range and therefore Ticketmaster resale are basically asking me to pay for someone's ticket to have a better seat then mine... I then gave up trying to argue as it wasn't acceptable for me to pay $213.40, the last email I received was the choice of a refund or ticket better than the one originally bought... there is never a choice for the seller (aka me) to approve of these choices and therefore Ticketmaster resale only looks out for those buying not selling as all they want to do is con people into paying them an unreasonable amount of money, the service provided towards my issue wasn't approach appropriately as the people laughed and disagreed to my opinions, they're trying to hide their arses as they know I'm on to them, because of this experience I will never use or trust Ticketmaster resale again as they have put me in a position that isn't fair on my behalf...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:11:25.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

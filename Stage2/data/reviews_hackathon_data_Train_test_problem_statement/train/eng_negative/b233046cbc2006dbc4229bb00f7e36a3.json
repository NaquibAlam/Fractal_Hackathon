Then they need A little help so they bring in someone to financially help, for a cost of course. You do it because you feel you have no choice, then they submit applications for you. In our case they submitted only 6 total applications and half of them were incorrect, so a total of 3 applications went through. We did receive funding but for only a fraction of what they said they could get. After we received our funding that financial guy took his cut, they took their cut and we got basically nothing. In the beginning they would talk to you everyday and then the further everything went they would stop calling or returning calls or just not acknowledge you anymore. In short horrible,horrible experience with this company lendio and they will prey on the innocent and always come out of the deal better than you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T21:49:48.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

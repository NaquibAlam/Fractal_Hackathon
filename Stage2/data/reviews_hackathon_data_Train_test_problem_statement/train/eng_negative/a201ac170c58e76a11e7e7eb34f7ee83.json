Beware!!!\nI created an account and proceeded to top up a support carrier in a supported country. Surprise \"Transaction Failed\" so automatically on their FAQ type in \"Failed to see what could have gone wrong, reading up it states that they will try to charge again!!! What??? The money is already withheld from the previous transaction and they will try again?? What in God's world are you thinking?\nI will not recommend this service to anyone, and I know that they will not post this to their site as it only shows the \"Good reviews\" probably done by their own team since I see many unsatisfactory reviews on TrustPilot\nTo me this site is deceiving and able to collect data from you, I will always recommend using a third party service such as PayPal to avoid providing your card details to this people.\nI requested my refund immediately by email as I do not want to deal with this company anymore. For those who decide to use the service, beware.\nModification after they replied:\n**So if there was issue when I created my account, why would you let me use my PayPal account? Wouldn't be better to clarify that there were security checks pending on the account before you let anyone use their card. Say what you want, it seems that you are very defensive, but this site is garbage, you always try to blame the user for the issues, specially for bad reviews. Fix you site, your process and these bad reviews will go away. I was not given any indication that my account was pending or needed verification. You might be defensive because it is your business, but please understand that you are messing with people's money, yes, you might refund the transaction which takes 7-10 business days to reflect back on their card, if that was the only money to help out a friend with a top up, I would be out of luck for at least 7 days. That is not a solution, once you understand that and fix the process, you will have less complaints.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:42:56.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The airline stoped operations from the airport I was going to fly from a month later. Travelup offered another flight from another aiport 2 hours away from the airport I was originally to fly or a refund.\nAs flying from the new airport wasn't convenient, I was offered a refund, however not for the total amount. Travelup deducted Â£100 + despite they received a full refund from the airline. Travelup said I had to pay some taxes (original booking fee, credit card charges, ATOL protection fees, Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance fees ,Saafi charges and ticket suppliers).\nThey said the refund will be actioned 8-9 weeks after they received the refund from the airline wich was expected early December. It is now nearly March and I haven't received no refund. Neither they are bothering replying my emails, so I have decided to take the matter to the small claims court.\nMy advice is to stay away from this company and their sister companies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T17:40:09.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

One my actual dress size and the other one size larger. Hoping that depending on which dress I liked that, I would know which size to get. However, neither dress fit. At all. Not even close. They were about 4-6 sizes too small. When I went to return them, I had the option to ship it myself or pay $8 (taken from my refund) to ship it back. Then, I the option to get 100% store credit or take 10% off of purchase price for a 'restocking fee'. Obviously I won't be purchasing from them again so I took the 10% off of each item for 'restocking' because I didn't want a store credit.\nNow, I have no dress, am out $8 in return shipping, and 10% from each dress in restocking. This totals about $30. I am grossly disappointed. The only reason I didn't give one star is because the dresses were cute.\nI will not order again and do not recommend Prom Girl to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:58:09.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

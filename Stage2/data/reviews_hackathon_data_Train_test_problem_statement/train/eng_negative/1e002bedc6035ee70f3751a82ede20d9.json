I was placed on hold several times, once over 10 minutes, and the agent I spoke with seemed confused about the whole verification process. After conferencing in a representative from my credit card company I was also asked to provide a copy of my ID to verify the purchase. After I refused to do so, the agent spoke with his manager and said that that step was not necessary. This especially gave me very little confidence in this business and I would not use their services again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T09:50:14.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

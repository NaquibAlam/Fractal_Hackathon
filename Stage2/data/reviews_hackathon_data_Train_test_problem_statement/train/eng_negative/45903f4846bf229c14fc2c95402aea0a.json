They advertise as a \"local\" florist in any city you can name, however they are in NJ and everything is farmed out or shipped UPS. The phone service is atrocious as they leave you on hold forever and then cut you off. If you do have any customer service issues, they fail to take any blame and only offer partial credit and then store credit, as if you would ever use it. When they do send UPS, they do not send tracking info, so you never know about delivery. All you can do is dispute with your credit card company. Don't ever use your debit card!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:12:27.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

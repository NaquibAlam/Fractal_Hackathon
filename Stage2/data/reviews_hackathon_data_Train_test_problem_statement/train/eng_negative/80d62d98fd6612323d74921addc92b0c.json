I had placed a Mavic Pro on order and my charge card was charged on 11/12/2016. When I placed the order I was told that it would arrive 11/30-12/7. That was delayed a few weeks, then a few more week, then a few more weeks. After paying interest on the item for 2 months I finally canceled the order and was able to purchase the product at another website and received it in 2 days. I think it unreasonable that my charge card was charged before this item was even in stock. At $1000 charge I paid about $30-40 in interest for an Item they never intended to ship. Also when canceling the order I was informed that it would be shipped in Late February, which probably woud have turned into MARCH.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:50:52.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We called in and spoke to the representative who assured us that the navy suit was, in fact, the color represented in the photo. So, we placed our order. When we received the suits, they were almost black and not the lighter navy blue with gray tones shown in the photo. I immediately called Black Tux and were told that there is nothing they can do about the misrepresentation in the photo or what the representative originally told us. They basically bait and switch and then less than two weeks before the wedding can only offer a refund rather than appropriately correct the problem. It's very clear that trying to do this online is not appropriate. They have left a disappointed wedding party stranded. I understand the positive reviews. I believe they have grown fast and can't stay ahead of their business. If they started offering a different color navy suit, they should have updated the photo on the website. Companies that can't stay up with their demand ultimaltely end up failing. Saying that you can only refund the money rather than finding a solution shows they are too busy and is a sign of desp trouble ahead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T06:01:13.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

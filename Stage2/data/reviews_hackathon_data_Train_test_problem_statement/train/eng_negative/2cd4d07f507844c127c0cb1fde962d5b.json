I had a hard time understanding he customer service reps. I found flights on FlightHub website to change too but each time I called to rebook \"the fares were not available\" so I had to keep calling back. I never did change flights I had to cancel instead. I was angry with the outrageous fees to make the change and the rep didn't ever address my concerns or answer the questions I asked. She kept responding \"Do you want to change your flight?\" instead of answering my question which was \"What is the benefit of booking through FlightHub vs going right through the airline when the cancelation or change fee is more than double?\" She couldn't answer that!\nI finally talked to a rep after many phone calls who suggested I just get a refund and start over. It was a great idea that nobody else suggested!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:03:15.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We were told to pick up in Sydney then pick up at the airport. Pick time was 2pm, then 9am, then 11am.\nWe arrived at 1110am to be told the pick up time was 2pm and to go away for 3hrs and return at 2pm. We had to sit in airport arrivals with all our cases for 3hrs.\nWe returned and started the paperwork. Angela was as rude during this process as she had been earlier. I asked to hire a GPS only to be told you didn't have any. I am a foreign visitor with no knowledge of your countries roads. Angela helpfully said \"It is only 2 straight roads to Melbourne what is the problem?\". The problem was I wasn't going direct to Melbourne I was touring the east coast for 3 days. Angela didn't even offer a map or directions to a garage to buy a map.\nTo top it all, I refuelled the car prior to returning and find I have been charged an extra amount to refuel...really.\nSafe to say I am not impressed with Red Spot. I have always used Enterprise for car hire but never again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:47:08.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

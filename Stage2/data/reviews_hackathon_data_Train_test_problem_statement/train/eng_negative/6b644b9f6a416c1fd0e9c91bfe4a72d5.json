My code did not work and after a MONTH AND A HALF of trying to get a refund I am left without a refund and now without any money to buy a new SIM card for my new phone that was given to me out of pity (due to being an extremely broke student who relied on this company to work).\nDO NOT USE THIS COMPANY, they will not reply to your emails once they have your money and they will not issue a refund unless you continually hassle them over a ridiculous time span. To get a refund you need to take a video of the IMEI and unlock code not working which is extremely hard when you don't have a phone due to this situation!!!! Still waiting for my money back.\nHorrible service, absolutely a money grab and nothing more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T21:45:19.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

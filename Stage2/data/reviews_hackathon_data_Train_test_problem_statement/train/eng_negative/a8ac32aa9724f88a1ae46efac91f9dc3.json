No matter how bad of service I receive, I have never been bothered enough to write a review. But after this experience , I am compelled to warn future clients from ordering from purolator. This review takes precedence over studying for my exams (I'm a university student) - that is how bad my experience was.\nTheir customer service representatives are rude, incompetent and obviously hate their job. I've spoken to Cassie, Donna and someone else who has straight up interrupted/cut off my explanation more than 5 times in the conversation. My parents spent $75 on their \"next day delivery service\" but it's been more than 8 days with no sign of the package. When calling them to follow up it was a string of being transferred to different departments and after 1 hour on the phone the only solid answer I had received was (verbatim) \"for an unspecified reason the trucks were unable to deliver your package\". Literally that was their answer - that they had no clue why.\nThe package was a care package full of food made by my family. My 80 year old grandma hand-made meatballs, buns and meat sauce for me. We trusted purolator to deliver the package the \"next day\" as per their advertised service. Not only has the food most likely have gone bad by now, purolator refuses to claim responsibility and denies even a simple apology. At several times of the conversation on the phone the representative raised her voice to me to a shouting level, which I had recorded on my friend's phone. I have every evidence of their mismanagement and poor service. I felt mentally harassed, embarrassed and belittled to the point where I was shedding tears of frustration.\nIt's time for clients to take their money elsewhere as purolator truly is an apathetic, low-grade, incompetent and disappointing service. Never, never order from them! Please for the sake of your sanity, wellbeing - stay away!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:30:59.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

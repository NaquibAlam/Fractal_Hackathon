It is the first time I had my money roll over for a few months. Although you billed $150 to my credit card over the last three months ($50 each month) I am only able to spend my money in increments of $50. So if I want to order something for $69.99 I can only use $50 of the money you already took from my then I have to pay the difference on my credit card. So you take $19.99 more of my money by billing my credit card while I still have $100 in my Fabletics account. WHAT A RIP OFF. YOU TAKE MY MONEY THEN DON'T LET ME USE MY OWN MONEY AS I WANT!

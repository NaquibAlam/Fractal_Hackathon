One way calls, noise, missed calls, dropped calls, calls going to voicemail instead of call waiting, even with voicemail turned off. My sister and I have been trying unsuccessfully for over two weeks to get this resolved. We have been in touch with OOMA's service department numerous times, telling them over and over what issues are being encountered.\nWe have spent a lot of time on the phone with these \"technical\" experts, and the issues remain unresolved. Getting fed up with this experience and will likely change to another provider after using this crappy service for about a month. Do not purchase this service. It may be cheap, but the experience is terrible.\nThere are better providers out there.Chris from Drumbo Ontario", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:14:12.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

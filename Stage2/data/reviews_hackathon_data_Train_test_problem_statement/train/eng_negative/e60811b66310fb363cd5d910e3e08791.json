During the call I was told there was no need to sarcastic, when I voiced my concerns, when I suggested that the issue was not mine but theirs. Options from them were cancel or pay the difference. The lack of conciliatory tone during the call was troublesome for me. I accepted to cancel and the offered the chance for 'the Director' who was referred to by the person as the boss during the call, and also as the guy who said no way, the chance to email me and apologise in person, or I that I would feel obliged to share my experience on this website. He didn't bother and had other priorities and as such exposing the severe lack of his/her consideration and utter contempt for the customer base. Above is exactly what happened with no exaggeration. I suggest you avoid Shower Doctor and buy from one of the many other suppliers on the internet who actually advertises their products at a price they are willing to sell at, whose greed will not impact your entire bathroom refit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:40:46.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

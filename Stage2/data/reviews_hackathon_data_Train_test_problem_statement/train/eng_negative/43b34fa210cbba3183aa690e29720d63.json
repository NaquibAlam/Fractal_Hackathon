In 2015, I went to electronic means of payment. I contacted Deluxe and requested to be taken off their mailing list. Since that time, I have received endless solicitations from them for my old business and new online businesses I started. Since 2014, I have contacted Customer Service no less than 10 times requesting the solicitations to stop. Each time, I was reassured that they would end and they simply didn't. I now have solicitations going to my old addresses opening the door to identity theft. When I have called Deluxe, the Customer Service Agents continually try to reassure me that there is no way anyone could order checks in my name. Having been a police officer, I know that is highly untrue. Apparently, they are ignorant to the fact that it is one of the major reasons why the majority of transactions are now electronic. I will never use any of this company's services again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:45:40.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

In the ad it said brand new but when we received it the quad copter had already been opened and the security sticker that should have been on the case was gone. Inspecting the quad copter all of the sensor protectors that cover the sensors had already been removed. This quad had already been out and used. Very disappointing! The virtual viewer was a joke because it is very cheap and there is a divider between your eyes that blocks your view and you can see a black line between your eyes. Very cheap. We will never buy from Beachcamera again because they lied and sell cheap for not a cheap price!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:30:20.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

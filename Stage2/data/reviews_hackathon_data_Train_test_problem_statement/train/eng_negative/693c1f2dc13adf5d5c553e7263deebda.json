I email for help and the assistant took several transcribes to realize my card was Prepaid even after telling her 3 times previously that it was. They told me that they would not accept Prepaid Cards. Aliexpress has excepted and is still excepting my prepaid Master Card for over 3 years now and I have made purchases on DH Gate with it previously before it expired. They then just ignored me and went off line leaving me hanging there not knowing that the transcribe had ended. They also had sent me a link to a site that was all in Chinese with no translation click.\nI get an order number emailed to me to pay for a purchase before it expires without a link to find and go there to remind me of what the item was so as to be able to do so.\nI would use aliexpress exclusively but there are still some items that I need that are sold here but not available there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T11:54:45.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Nothing was happening on it until I emailed them and started posting \"where is my product?\" on their review site. When they finally acknowledged it, they said it would have to wait another week because Chinese New Year was starting the next day (did I mention I bought this on their Chinese New Year Sale).\nWhen I finally got it, I cannot get any of the 3 computers in my house to recognize it. I emailed them for support and they sent me video links for YouTube. After trying to follow the videos closely and getting even further away from success, I emailed them my setup log files. They did not respond to the log files but they told me that the videos where for another product but would give me an idea of what needed to be done but I should really follow the instructions on the CD rom that came with the product.\nThey never have commented on my logs.\nLastly, I thought that I might buy the Wifi card for it since the USB was giving me grief. I was told that unlike the “real” MDI's, the one I bought cannot be upgraded. I said that it was not listed that way on the website but they said that their ad states \"GM MDI with USB\". Like that tells you that the WIFI cards have nothing to plug in to. Every MDI has USB. That is most likely the reason why the network jack shows no activity, it is not hooked to anything.\nThe product looks nice, I just cannot get it to work and they cannot seem to help me.\nbuyobdtoolshop.c0m/wholesale/gm-mdi-multiple-diagnostic-interface.html", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:52:13.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Very disappointing to find out that my dog was left alone in a home, and much more with the door open. I tried reaching out to Alexander via telephone and finally via Dogvacay messenger, prior days before going over to his house. Unfortunately, I was very tied up at work and had a gut feeling that something was wrong. I finally had a day off yesterday and decided to drive to Alexander's house to see what was happening. I stayed with my dog in the front yard of Alexander's house for about 10 to 15 mins, and still no one around to come out from the house. I take it Alexander may not have been home at the time, and probably left my dog with his roommate. I knocked on the patio door, and even hit the door bell and nothing. I was very alarmed with the neglect of my dog, and saw firsthand how easily she could of gotten lost. My dog has been with me for 8 years, and we consider her family. I take the risk and gamble with Dogvacay hosts as ultimately last resort. I am currently in between moving homes, if not I would not be using your service.\nFurthermore, I am missing some property that I was unable to retrieve from the property. Though the door was open, is unlawful to enter a home and dangerous. The risk was not worth taking, and decided to buy two new dog bowls, a new bag of dog food, new bed, and a new leash (about $100 that I did not expect to spend.) I would return to Alexander's house and retrieve my things, but I am afraid I am still too upset to even see him in person. I also left my dogs medication ( Apoquel 160 mg) x 30 pills, which run me about $3.10 per pill ( $93 total.) Overall, you can see how expensive this incident has been for my family. Please let me know how we can get my things in a timely manner.\nYou stated that you are still assessing whether or not Alexander will continue to be a host in the Dogvacay community. A company that seems to have forgotten what the most important value is in their business model, which is to advocate and protect our four legged friends. In your own words \"most rigorously vetted & trusted sitters available \", well you have failed. Alexander has your 101 dog training certificate, and what other certifications you may provide, but now hold little value. Dogvacay promises to “connect dog lovers with one another to find and provide safe, convenient and affordable ways for their best friend.” You offer a great service, but by no means is it affordable enough to put my dog at risk. You need to review you candidate selection process, and establish a higher sense of responsibility from all of them. Customer’s trust in your company and the brand to find a safe, comfortable, and responsible sitter for our loved ones. I see that you have provided a promo code for $150 for my next visit, and I thank you for that gesture. Fortunately, I still have a dog that I can find a sitter for but next time it won’t be with Dogvacay. I’ll make sure to spread my story with other friends whom referred me to your website, just so they know how imperfect the Dogvacay community currently is and how much more they need to improve.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T22:02:53.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

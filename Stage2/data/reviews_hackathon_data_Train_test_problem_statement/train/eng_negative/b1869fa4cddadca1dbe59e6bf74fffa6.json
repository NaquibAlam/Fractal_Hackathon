I followed all the advice & narrowed down on a supplier who was 'Gold supplier' with 'Trade assurance' & 'Onsite checked'. The supplier was in 7th year of business as per Alibaba. Till the time of purchase, the supplier agent replied to every query.\nAs soon as I made the purchase, the supplier vanished with no response to messages. After a lot of effort, the agent did finally respond but demanded additional fee for shipping (not disclosed at time of purchase) which was way more than the original fee and would leave no room for profit. When I asked the reason for this additional fee, the supplier conveniently gave an excuse that it was a mistake and original fee was misQuote: d.\nNow, i'm trying to get my money back but am not too hopeful. Fortunately, I invested only 50$ to test the waters. I was skeptical from the start but still wanted to give it a shot just to get a first hand experience.\nWarning to others: Don't get fooled by the hyped reviews & success stories by internet marketers. They are either promoting an ebook, video, plugin related to Alibaba which they want you to purchase. That's how they have become successful by conning people.\nEven if you do manage to get the shipment somehow, the profit you will make will be in single digits or you may even go in loss if you invest in advertising.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T13:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T11:45:06.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

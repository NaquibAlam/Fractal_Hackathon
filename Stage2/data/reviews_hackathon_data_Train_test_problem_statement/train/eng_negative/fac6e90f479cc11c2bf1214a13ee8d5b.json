But let me emphasize that all the 5 star ratings are robots and fake reviews.\nLast year i bought an arrangement for 49.99$ its was tiny, and honestly pathetic for a floursit. This year, same exact boquet was 69.99$. I continued to give the company the benefit of the doubt, and purchased it, assuming the increase was due to inflation. The delivery was set for Tuesday 3/28. Today is Wednesday 3/22 and according to my tracker, the flowers were delivered YESTERDAY. Theyre for my mothers birthday, she is out of town this week and was not there to accept the order, on top of that, theyre gonna be dead by the time she gets home and has her birthday.\nThey wont resend the boquet, or admit their error. I am required to repurchase for a wopping total of 90$ including delivery charge....", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T10:33:10.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

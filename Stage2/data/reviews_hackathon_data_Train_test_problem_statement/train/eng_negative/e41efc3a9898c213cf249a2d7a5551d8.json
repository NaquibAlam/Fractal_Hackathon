When I made the reservation I gave them my flight information. We arrived at 9:30 pm to find the counter closed. We took a cab to our resort ($75) and went back the next morning ($75) to find that they did not have our cars. They claimed that I reserved the car for noon and at 1:00, per their terms and conditions, they did not have to honor our agreement. They offered a refund of $180 on a $900 bill. I'm having to go thru my credit card company to get my money back. Definitely not how you want to start a vacation:(", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T14:50:33.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

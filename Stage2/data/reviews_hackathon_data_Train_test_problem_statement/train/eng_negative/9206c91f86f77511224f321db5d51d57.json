I took the attached photos and marked it on the attached drawing/sketch to document it.\nToday I went back to the airport (30 minutes drive) in order to rectify the lease documentation, but I was meet by a very aggressive, middle-aged, male, Goldcar office person refusing to rectify the documents or to inform me of what to do, he repeatedly stated that I should have gone back to the office inside the airport secure area, when I replied that it is impossible to reenter the airport secure area, he then refused to talk to me and turned his back to me and walked away. I find this kind of reply and behavior very rude.\nI donÂ´t intend to waste more of my time please let me know what to do, as I do not intend to be responsible for the mentioned damages/dents/scratches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:35:22.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

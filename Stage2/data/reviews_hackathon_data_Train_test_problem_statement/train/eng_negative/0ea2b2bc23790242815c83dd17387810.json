I called every week checking on status here we are into February still no answer when I call American to check they either don't call back or tell me still nothing from the manufacturer. So I want my money back for the whole set I am done messing with this company the couch I had before the one I bought from American Freight i had for 12 years and it still looked brand new the only reason why i got rid of it is because we moved and our living room was too big for it. I am very displeased with American Freight all together. their customer service is also crap!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:16:04.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I would have needed you to pay for the NEW title, plates ( since I handed them to Motor Vehicles and also 2 registrations and time at NJMV.\nBottom line is that - If you cant handle the criticism DON\"T ASK FOR A REVIEW and send back BS replies. The deal is done and leave it at that. Would have been easier at a salvage yard, a few dollars less, no pissing match. I DIONT WANT ANY MORE CORRISPONANCE WITH YOU OR THE COMPANY!\nAdditional Info\nFirst Kevin wasn't there when the car was sold, only the associate! So he's talking about what the company program is. Also he or a rep called me asking me to change my review! Did he state that, NO. He must have been online, since the sales person had to send emails /test message to get any answers for every question and concerns!\nBill or Sale / Title all the same to me.. All I'm saying is that as far as I'm concerned. All the papers that they wanted me to sign was after I signed off on the car on the title / bill of sale. OK\nIn the past when selling a car in NJ, as the seller I need to show I own the car( letter once the loan company / bank etc showing that the car is mine) . Next odometer reading is correct and day of sale and sign off. The buyer now OWNS that car! no paper work except check or cash to me. Not all paperwork, for me to sign if the buyer loses the title / bill of sale.\nOnce again not giving me a chance to explain my side. But I just got around the system!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:45:51.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

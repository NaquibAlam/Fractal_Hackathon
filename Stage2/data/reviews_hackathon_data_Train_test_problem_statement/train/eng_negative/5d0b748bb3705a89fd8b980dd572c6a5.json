The price was less than other sites. The problem is, the on-line form allows you to put where you want to pick up and drop off the vehicle, then all your information, including payment. It does not stop you if the pick up/drop off site is not available. So, you pay, get your confirmation that has a different pick up/drop off site that was populated by the site, without you knowing. When you try to cancel, you are told there is a fee, and if within a certain time frame, you will have to pay the entire rental amount. Usually sites will pause processing if there is a discrepancy along the way. Will not use the site again and sharing this so others can be cautious.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:44:17.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

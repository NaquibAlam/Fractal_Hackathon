This week there was a schedule change at work. So I tried to go online and have my box shipped to the state in which I am traveling . Customer service gave me several bogus excuses such as I put the wrong address. Then they said it's too late because the package had shipped already, however my delivery isn't schedule until Tuesday the 7th. Make a long story short Joe stated they would still deliver the box to my home address, regardless of the fact no one will be there, and payment had been charged to my credit and there was nothing I could do. He completely talked over me and stated again, they had already been paid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:36:21.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I went to print the voucher it had the price listed on it and didn't have the greeting I requested. After speaking to their Live Chat agent and then calling a 'manager' at the call centre they advised this was a known issue, they were unable to fix it and I was not allowed to remove the price from the voucher. As this is a gift this is unacceptable. To make matters worse the manager said the advice the Live Agent gave me was incorrect.\n- If this is a known issue why is still available on the website?\n- Why is incorrect information being given by agents?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:29:56.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

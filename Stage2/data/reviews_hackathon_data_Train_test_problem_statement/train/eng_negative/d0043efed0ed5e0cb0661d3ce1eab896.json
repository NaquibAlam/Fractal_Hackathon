Spoke with manager advised to speak with one of the reps. Was interested in layaway for about 2 month. The y do layaway. Advised we would come back Friday to start it. Came in to speak with the rep she was busy but got to me. She mentioned financing and how I can get my furniture now and can pay it off. I told her I didn't like the financing part. But it same as 90 day cash and we will be paying off in 2 months anyway. Sounded great. I got set up to apply to progressive but got denied because they can't verify my bank account. I use a credit union. I ended up doing the layaway and was advised I can still do 90 days. Took me about a week to deal with Progressive but they finally verified my bank account. I was excited so I called the store to let them know and they should have received a message. The rep wasn't available so another person answered and helped. He stated I only got approved for $750. I'm clueless and wasn't even informed that they approve for a certain amount at all. He said they can increase the amount but only by 10%. What?? The furniture balance was $1500. Anyway long story short I didn't get furniture because we was not fully informed of the process. We are thinking about pulling out layaway and going somewhere else. We could have just bought each piece. Smh disappointed", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:55:04.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

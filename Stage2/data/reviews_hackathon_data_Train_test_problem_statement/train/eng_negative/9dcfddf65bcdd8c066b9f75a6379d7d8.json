At first it wasnt making noise but a day later, it was more squeking than before (it used to be once in a while- now its everytime I brake and now its another noise - whistling ...more noise added!! Its worse than before and its embarrassing!! - so basically the mechanic screwed me over and they are charging me $80 for another crappy mechanic- I WILL NEVER RETURN OR HAVE ANY OF THEM WORK ON MY CAR AGAIN!! JUST GO TO THE SHOP- I HAD TO LEARN THE HARD WAY!! Now either I have to work on it myself or pay money at the shop- they put me in a bad situation:( Either way I would have been paying the same amount (your mechanic:170+ 80=250... shop- SEARS - $300..only a $50 difference but at least you can be sure to have good service free of defects and they will make it better, not worse)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:23:16.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

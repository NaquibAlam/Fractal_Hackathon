I was staying in Canada for almost a month and they delay so much I'm leaving the country, not on empty handed but also had payed extra to arrive faster.

Never again I'll use this service, also if anyone is thinking about buying at B&H I suggest you rethink that, it's from where I placed my order, they too were neither willing or unable to do anything.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:02:00.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

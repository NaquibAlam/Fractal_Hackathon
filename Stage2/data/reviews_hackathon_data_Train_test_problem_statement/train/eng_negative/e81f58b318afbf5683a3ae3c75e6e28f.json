Within an year the phone frame started to bent, which also causes the screen protrude away from frame. Its clearly a build quality issue of the phone. When contacted coolicool , they wanted me to pay for the repairing cost(replacing screen). They are purposefully avoiding to answer the main 2 problem. 1) poor build quality causes the phone to bent 2) Manufacturing warranty, so that I need to replace the phone. They thing they act smart by avoiding from main issue. Very poor customer service and they don't want to do anything after they sell the product to you, simply wash their hands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:35:57.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

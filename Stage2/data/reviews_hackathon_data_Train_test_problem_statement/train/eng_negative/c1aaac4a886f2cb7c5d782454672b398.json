Paddy Power has an offer where if you palce 50 tennis bets in a week, you get one free bet of the average stake upon 250 pounds. This week on Sunday, i had 47 tennis bets, i had to place 3 more, i had one in play which was suppoed to be voided. At 10:25 Pm i went on chat talking with Alan telling hime that i need the bet to be settled so i can place my money on something else. I talked with him on lenght and he wasnt able to help me. I dont even know why they have customer service. I was not able to place the last 3 bets until 23:59 so all my work was for nothing and all because of how bad this company it is. Basicaly, when you are close to get 50 bets, they stop settling your bets so you dont get the bonus. So they do whatever they want with you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:53:35.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

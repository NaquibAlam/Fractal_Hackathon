When I callled Avas a little before 7pm because it had not arrived yet, I was placed on hold then told they could not get a hold of the driver and that it would likely be delivered today. I was already upset about this but then this evening when I checked in with the recipient and was told she did not receive the balloon and when I asked about the card and she sent me a picture of the usual tiny floral card....and THEN she sent me a pic of the arrangement she received which looked absolutely NOTHING like what I ordered...I am friggin LIVID. Never again will I order from this place. I want a full refund AND they should deliver the CORRECT order at no charge. I was hoping to use this service on a regular basis but there is no way that will happen within this kind of horrible service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T11:27:00.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

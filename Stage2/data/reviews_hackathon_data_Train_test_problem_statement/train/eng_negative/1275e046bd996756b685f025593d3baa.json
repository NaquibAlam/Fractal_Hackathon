They require that your payment be processed with additional processing fees unless you buy \"credits\" which are only purchased in increments of $10. Furthermore all refunds are not refunded to your original payment but into \"credits\" that must be used at envato. If you choose to buy another item with those refunded credits you must complete the purchase with credits and cannot use PayPal or a credit card to complete the difference. This means in many cases you are forced to buy more credits in increments of $10 ($20) minimum. This forces the customer to waste money amd I consider it a form of legalized theft.\nWhen I confro thier customer service about these issues, which are only reached by email hour later, they had little regard for my concern and offered no resolution.\nOverall I would not use envato as a seller nor buyer as this company should not be rewarded for it's unethical and unfriendly business practices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T09:18:39.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

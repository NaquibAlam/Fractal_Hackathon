So I chose the buy three get three deal for first time users. My first box took about two-three weeks to get to my house (which is perfectly fine), but I did not get a single candy I wanted. All six were wrong. I emailed Candy Club and they were very great about making sure I'm happy and sent me a new box with the original order. Well, I received my second box that was supposed to replace my other candies and what do you know...my order was wrong again. I'm a little bothered by it and was thinking that surely they wouldn't mess my order up a second time. I figure that I pay a good amount of money for candy so I at least want exactly what I ask for. I definitely will not be buying again :(", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:14:03.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was at this point that I realized I had been entirely wrong to assume that the price i had found and agreed to pay, would be the actual price taken from my account!!!\nOne prompt confirmation email later, and I realise my great flight prices were coupled with an extortionate and unethical 32 euro charge!!! NOT WHAT I AGREED!\nEven worse, when I called customer service, I was connected to last.minute CS who blamed another website entirely - cancelled my flight and were unable to refund my money for a further 2 weeks! by which point flight prices have inevitably increased by more than 30 euros!!!

I get an email telling me that one of the frames that I ordered was discontinued and one was back ordered. I was truly upset with that because if the frames that I wanted was unavailable, they should have not been offered on the website. I then started communicating with a rep named Frances that informed me about the issue. I then proceeded to re do my order and and get something different. I informed Frances that of my changes to my order in which i requested the Polo PH2166 in the Shiny Jerry Tortoise and the Shiny Black and no changes to the order for the shades. Frances completely dropped the ball with my order. She ended up cancelling my order for the back ordered Polo PH 2123 and Exchanged the order for the Polo PH2166 Shiny Black to the Shiny Jerry Tortoise. Instead of exchanging the back ordered Polo PH2123 for the Polo PH 2166 Shiny Jerry Tortoise. So far I have receive the Shades Polo PH4098 Top Black on Jerry Tortoise and the Polo PH2166 Shiny Jerry Tortoise which arrived a week ago. I then called FramesDirect inquiring about my order and spoke with a different rep in which I explained my concerns. The rep appeared like she understood my concerns and assured me that she will fix the issue but she dropped the ball. I then received a call from Frances late last week apologizing for the mix up and assured me that she will fixed the mistake and get my glasses ordered. Now an entire week pass by and I have not received an email confirming my order. Once again I called inquiring about my order only to find out that Frances never submitted the order. Now it's 02/16/17 still no order for my glasses, however the rep that took the call Nelly understood my frustration and took control of the entire issue placed my order for my glasses. I even received the email notification. Now I am happy. I get a call from Nelly today informing me that the vendor informed her that the glasses that I want are no longer available in The US and will have to be shipped form their overseas location which will take an additional 11 - 15 days in order to receive the frame and another 5 - 8 days to add the lenses. Now I am COMPLETELY UPSET!!! that Frances dropped the ball. At the end of the day, my original order started on 01/24/17 and will not complete until sometime in March. I must give Extremely HIGH praises to Nelly for contacting me and keeping me the loop. Her professionalism is 20 cuts above the rest and I must say she is Heaven sent GREAT JOB NELLY", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T23:17:51.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

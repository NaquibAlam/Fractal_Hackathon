My brother help me booked it as I wasn't sure what to do and as he's used this website before a few times. I noticed after he booked it that the names were wrong I rang last minute and the airline straight away and they ensured me that since the tickets hasn't been sent they will change the name free of charge. few weeks later I didn't receive any updated ticket information so I rang again and they assured me they had changed them. A Day before I fly I went to check in at the airport and I couldn't because the names still hasn't been changed. So rang last minute and was told they will ring me back they never did. So rang again they promised they would phone back within two hours and still didn't bother. So rang again and finally got through and they charged me £100 for something they said they would sort. When I tried to explain what I had been told a few months ago they didn't even acknowledge or look into it. So was forced to paid £100 otherwise I would of lost my booking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T08:05:40.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

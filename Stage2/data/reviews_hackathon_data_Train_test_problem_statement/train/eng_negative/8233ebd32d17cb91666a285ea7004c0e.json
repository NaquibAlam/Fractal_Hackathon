I look up for some recess trim and led all in one lights and came up with these rab lights. the price was around $13 and so I was something is not rt here. so I call in an speak to a rep and verify the price and they say no the price is correct. So I said please send me an email with the order confirmation. I told him I needed the lights by 1/17/2017. which again was told it was correct and I should have them by that time. shipment is coming from Tennessee. Then last night I'm like crap I have gotten them yet what going on. I look and they canceled the order. are you kidding me. they canceled it because the pricing was not correct. I called them and confirmed the pricing. was on the line with them for 12 minutes so they could verify the pricing. then call them and I get told people make mistakes. Not in this situation. I called you to verify the price, told you I needed them by Tuesday and you cancel the order without even letting me know. they say they sent me an email but I'm sure it went to junk and why would I be looking for an email by them. I verified it with them. Now I don't have light and out thousands with workers there trying to put in lights today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T11:48:11.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

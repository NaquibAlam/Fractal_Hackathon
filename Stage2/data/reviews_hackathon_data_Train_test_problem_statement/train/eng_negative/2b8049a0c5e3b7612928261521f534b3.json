Poor communication!\nYou should be focusing on the quaility of the service your providing not worrying about sending the items as soon as possible because you don't want to hold the order up.\nI would've got other colours to make up for those items being out of stock so I didn't leave myself short and I was still able to provide a service to my clients.\nInstead of being understanding on the phone when I made contact this morning she was rude and continued to state all this information that wasn't needed as I understood you don't do back orders but if I had been made contact with I would've organised something else.\nNot good enough when your a supplier and you can't supply or make actual contact with the customer to see if you can make other arrangements to provide them with all that you can.\nTruly disappointed as I was going to use you as my main supplier but poor service and communication!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:13:58.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They said the flowers would most likely be delivered on 2/13 or 2/14, and I was okay with that.\nOn 2/12/17, two days before Valentine's Day they sent me an email claiming they could not deliver the flowers until 2/15/17, the day AFTER Valentine's Day! I replied to the email because I was now overseas requesting them to make an exception in my case because my wife was home alone and pregnant. It would be nice if she received the flowers ON Valentine's Day.\nThey didn't seem to care and delivered the flowers a day late anyway. They still charged me the $83, but offered a 10% discount.\nI think they shouldn't claim reliability and customer service if they're going to treat their customers this way.\nI will never use Ava's Flowers again, and will recommend my friends and family never use them either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:18:25.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

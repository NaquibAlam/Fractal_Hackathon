We arrived at around 7.30pm at night, the place was not as described, we did not have the bedroom we were expecting and the place was cold and uninviting. It was small yet we were expecting a different house, a large 4 bedroom place? It was a small 3 bdm home. We were surprised to see that we were expected to share a communal bathroom with toilet in it, (no towel or soap provided in bathroom), with a family and their overseas family staying. Only one living space. (Their family members were staying in the room we were originally expecting to stay in.) The bedroom allocated was small, cold and obviously a child's bedroom. No where to sit, and no radio or tv. We were greeted with a list of things and were told not to be noisy! The day was miserable, but we were not invited to light the fire. We left within 3 minutes of arriving and text the host to inform her that the place was not suitable and started the long drive back home. The host to her credit, offered a 1 night refund as we had paid for 2 nights. We only however received a part of this, as she also deducted commission and kept the whole second nights stay! A disappointing experience. I can only suggest you provide accurate information when listing a property so people are not disappointed, and bathroom facilities are really important to know about.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T17:52:46.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

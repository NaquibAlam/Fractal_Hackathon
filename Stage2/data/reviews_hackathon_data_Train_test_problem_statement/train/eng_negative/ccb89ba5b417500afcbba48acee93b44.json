I booked a hotel on their website and then realised that I had put in the incorrect dates so I called them within 2 minutes to make the changes. They contacted the hotel who agreed not to put through any penalty rates to make the change in dates and that I could either select a 1 bedroom apartment for similar value or upgrade to a two bedroom dual key unit which was $1618. I then asked them to make notes on the file about the discussion and said I would think about it. They said they would. I called back the next day. Last Minute had to contact Castlereagh Oaks to reconfirmed what was arranged the day before as notes had not been made on the file. When they contacted the hotel Castlereagh Oaks decided I could upgrade from my two bedroom unit at $963. I would only be charged for the difference between the two prices however the Oaks Castlereagh now decided to add on a penalty of $50 which Last Minute decided to give me a discount for. Last Minute made the booking. I then checked my credit card later that night only to discover I was charged $963 plus $1618. I phoned them immediately. They then said that they had to listen to the telephone messages to see what has happened but not to worry that the matter will be resolved and I would receive my money back. I then received an email saying that I sent a copy of my back statements from another email address not registered on the system and that I would have to start the process all over again. I then called Last Minute to resolve the matter. They contacted the Oaks Castlereagh again who now decided that I have two bookings with them and that they were not prepared to cancel either of them. I am so disappointed as I am now out of pocket $1618 plus $963. Last Minute has yet to come back to me to resolve this. I am so upset about this as money was taken from my account without authority and now I have to spend endless hours on the phone trying to resolve this. I am also disappointed in the attitude of the Oaks Castlereagh who are taking advantage of the situation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T10:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T18:11:05.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

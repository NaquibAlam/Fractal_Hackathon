It took almost two weeks before the delivery arrived. I had already spent 17 pounds for having it delivered here. When I went to the post office to collect my order, I had to pay further 48 pounds to get the package. When I called costumer service, a rude lady told me they do put it on the page that the IVA was not included, well they do not. All in all, you might as well buy the stuff from other websites, it ends up as expensive on this site as on the others.

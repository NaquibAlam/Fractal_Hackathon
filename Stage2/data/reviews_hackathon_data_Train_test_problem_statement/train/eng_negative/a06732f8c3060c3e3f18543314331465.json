I got email and text confirming that my transaction was successful on Dec 2, 2016. More than a month later, no money in my Indian account. One rep told me that Remitly's partner bank reversed the transaction for \"unknown\" reasons and they have sent an email (3 days ago) to inquire about it. 2 hours later another rep sends me an email saying my bank has rejected the transaction for invalid account (2 previous transaction via Remitly to same bank and same account were successful and this account is active for more than 15 years). They do not have answers to my questions and everytime I just get an email to be patient while they are looking in to it. IT's BEEN MORE THAN ONE MONTH THEY HAVE MY MONEY WHILE I CONTINUE TO PAY INTEREST ON THIS AMOUNT. The transaction on their web has now changed from \"Successful\" to \"on hold\" waiting for information from me. They are still waiting for a response from their partner bank.

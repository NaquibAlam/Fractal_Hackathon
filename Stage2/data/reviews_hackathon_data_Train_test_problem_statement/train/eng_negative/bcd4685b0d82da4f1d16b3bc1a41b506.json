However, the next day they emailed us to cancel and reappoint to the following Monday. On the Sunday before they cancelled again to the Thursday.\nCan u guess what happened then. Yep the weds before they cancelled til the following Monday.\nNot once did they offer any sort of apology or reason.\nIn the end my son rang them and cancelled. He was told ' ok we will cancel your appointment' and that was it.\nWe ended going to a local garage and they were great.\nI sent an email 12 days ago expressing my dissatisfaction, received a reply saying that they ' were working hard to deal with my complaint and someone would be in touch in 2-3 days.\nAfter 7 days -nothing. Sent another email and still nothing .\nCertainly won't be using them again and have spread the word to all the people who I'd recommended them too", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:52:02.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

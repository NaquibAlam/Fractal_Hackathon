Further problems in that the dashmat was lost in courier transit somehow (according to Motoquipe) and took another 9 days to remake and deliver. So almost 6 weeks from start to final delivery of order.\nCar seat covers look good and have no issues other than turnaround time.\nBUT, the \"custom\" dashmat is just a dashmat mass produced for a different model vehicle that has an extra piece of matching fabric loosely tacked over an area that would leave an exposed hole in our model car. A couple of stiches on either side barely holds it in place and everyone who gets into my car tugs on it thinking it is an intended flap that opens. Mostly it looks like a dodgy home job. Not what I expected.\n***Edit in reply to response***I think you will find that actullay Shevron are the only brand who take a Dodge model Dashmat and loosely stitch extra fabric over a non-conforming spot. Not quite the same thing as custom, and there was definitely no indication of that in the description or photos. Having an uncommon car doesn't mean I have to be grateful for deceptive or poor products or services. Nor do I expect a company to disclose personal information about me in a reply to a review they do not like.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T09:30:14.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

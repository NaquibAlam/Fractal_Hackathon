I have emailed and follow up for several times then only they replied by saying that they have confirmed with their repacking staff where they have consolidated 3 packages and shipped it.\nHowever, in fact, their repacking staff did not consolidate 1 of the packages. It is evidenced by the ‘detailed description of contents’ of shipping label which paste on the parcel. It is clearly showed that there was only 2 items they have sent. As I have total 3 packages, how come there was only 2 items!\nIn addition, the billable weight of the parcel I received is only 1 lbs, while the net weight of the items in all of my 3 packages has already exceeds 1 lbs, and this has not including the packaging weight. How could the billable weight is only 1 lbs if the net weight of my 3 packages' items has already more than 1 lbs?\nApart from this, the size of the parcel I have received was only 15cm x 11.5cm x 12.5 cm. It is so obvious that this small size couldn’t accommodate all my items.\nI have emailed several times to seek for their clarification but they never bother to respond. I couldn’t understand if this is a reputed company, why don’t they investigate and clarify. I’m truly upset and suspecting that this is their normal practice where the package missing without any reason/explanation. I guess I have lost my money and my package. I would advise all ‘BE CAREFUL AND PLEASE AVOID THIS COMPANY!’.\nUPDATE from usgobuy on Feb 16, 2017 after provide them the picture of shipping label, purchase invoice of missing item, and tracking number of missing item as requested:\nWe are sorry to tell you that your missing package 344759302078880 is not in our warehouse, and our repacking staff confirmed we have consolidated all of your 3 packages and shipped to you.\nSince there is no insurance applied for USPS first-class packages. We cannot file any claims to USPS or refund to you.\nIn this case, we would like to send you a $5 coupon, you can apply it for your next parcel when payment amount is over $50. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may caused to you.\nI'm truly upset with this kind of official explanation without proper explanation on my doubts on the shipping label, weight and size of the parcel that I have received. Well, if their repacking staff has really consolidated and shipped, how come 1 of my packages' item is not listed in shipping label? The parcel/box's size and weight that I have received all proved that 1 of my packages has not consolidated and shipped.\nMy first and ever experience with usgobuy is totally a disaster and if anyone read this, please choose other fowarder services.\nUPDATE from usgobuy on Feb 18, 2017:\nWe have checked the information on your shipping label of parcel LZ106815735US, I think it's a strong evidence. Based on this information, I will check with our warehouse once again why there is incomplete information on the label, and if it has something to do that we forget to consolidate the parcel.\nWe will get back to you within 1-2 business days.\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:01:56.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

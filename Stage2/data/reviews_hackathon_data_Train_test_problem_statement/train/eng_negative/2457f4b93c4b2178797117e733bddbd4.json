The airline cancelled my return flight. Lastminute informed me by email and told me I could book another return flight on a different day or get a refund.\nI requested a refund Quote: over one month ago and am supposed to hear back from Lastminute within seven days. I have not received it, over one month later. I have called Lastminute maybe 15 times. Every time I am told I will get an update and callback within 7 days, or 24 hours, or that evening, or within 3 hours. No one ever gets back to me.\nAll I hear are apparently sincere constant apologies and claims that my query is being 'escalated' and re-escalated and that the problem lies with the airline, as they are not responding to your requests for a refund Quote: . I find this extremely hard to believe: I have called the airline many times and am told every time that according to their terms and conditions, it is the booking agent (Lastminute) that's responsible for calculating and issuing a refund. I can get through to them on the phone in less than 3 minutes. They are extremely helpful and efficient so I don't understand why it's taking ONE MONTH for Lastminute to get in touch with them. I can only conclude you haven't tried to get in touch with them and are simply stalling in order to keep my money.\nI am in Cameroon and supposed to fly home in a little over a month. I desperately need to resolve this situation, get the refund that is owed to me in order to get home.\nThis is clearly your business model. There are hundreds of posts/stories like mine on the internet.\nWhen are You going to sort this out?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:08:02.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

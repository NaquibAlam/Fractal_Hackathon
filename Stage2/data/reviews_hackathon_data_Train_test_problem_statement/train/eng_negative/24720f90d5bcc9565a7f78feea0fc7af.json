WELL, THE DISAPPOINTMENT DOESN'T END THERE!!! the new shoes were 1/2 inch longer than the other men's large \"pairs\" i had ordered in the past. being in a wheelchair is difficult enough, now i have a shoe in each pair that hangs out over my footstand and is constantly hitting things.\ni am looking for an alternative. lymphedema products and company do not work for the customer they work for their ceo(money), it feels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T11:54:14.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

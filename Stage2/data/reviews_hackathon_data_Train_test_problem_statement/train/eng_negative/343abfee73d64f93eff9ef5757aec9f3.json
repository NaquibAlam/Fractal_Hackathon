Except they had my phone during that period so it was a bit odd. There was no mention of leaving an alternate number on the screen or else I would have done so. It simply said 'phone number.' Everything looked fine at first glance but on closer look one side of the screen was elevated. An hour or 2 later, I made a call and my screen was flickering and then went black. Quite odd. After a few moments I tried to test it again make a facetime call and it went black again. Later on I attempted using apps but each time I would open an app the screen would go black again. Weird right?\nSo I email FoxPaw asking for a refund because obviously waiting 6 hours, paying $100, and getting a phone worse off is not what I paid for. I was later informed that refunds weren't available because there was a 1 year warranty and I would need to bring the phone back in. Who has 6 hours to give again to be without their main source of communication? The only time a refund was possible was if Foxpaw deemed the phone \"beyond repair\".\nThe moral of this story is I will just go to the apple store and pay the extra $50 to part with my phone for an hour as opposed to 6 and also have a functioning phone upon return. Or I just won't drop my phone =)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:33:07.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

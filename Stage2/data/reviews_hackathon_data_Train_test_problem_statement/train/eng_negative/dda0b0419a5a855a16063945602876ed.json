From the very start of the car hire process it was a sham, When we picked up the car it had 4 damaged panels on it, we stated we were not happy to take the car but were told this was the only car available and to complete a form to pre-identify the damage was present at pick up.We were advised there would not be any problems if we followed this policy, we did this.\nWe dropped the car off after hire with no further damage to the car but when I arrived home over 700 euros had been taken from my account for the damage.It is impossible to talk to Gold car after you car hire experience with any problems, you have to e mail the company.I emailed the company many times and every time it took week to get a reply. The issue has not been resolved and its taken 16 weeks to get to the unsatisfactory resolution that we wont be receiving a refund for the damage that was highlighted at pick up.\nWe have been left considerably out of pocket following our car hire experience, the car hire cost more than our total holiday. Gold car appears the cheaper option but in the long run you could be left with a very expensive car hire experience and many hours of your own time wasted trying to resolve the issues which will possibly end with you being left very frustrated and out of pocket.\nThe hire car company are insisting there is more damage to the car than highlighted at pick up despite this not beeping the case at drop off. There can only be two explanation, it is a fictitious claim that there is more damage to the car or that the damage was done after drop off but I am still being charged for it.\nDo not hire a car from this company as the treatment customers receive is diabolical and unethical.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T22:44:34.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

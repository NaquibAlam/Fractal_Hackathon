I thought I booked an early departing flight. When I got my itinerary it said I had an overnight flight. Seeing as I am under 18, I called to see if there is anything they could do to get me on an earlier flight. I got a major run around and was on the phone for 2 hours. After the two hours the answer I had was that I wasn't even allowed to be on the flight on the first place and I was going to have to pay to fix THEIR MISTAKE! I was not going to do this so I had my father call. He explained the situation and they said because of what happened they would waive the cancellation fee and refund all my money. Within 2 minutes there was a charge of $75.00 on my card and no refund in sight. The next day I got a refund of $14.95 from flighthub so I called there and they said that the company had refunded me in full. After being on the phone for almost an hour or more they said that the cost of my ticket would be refunded and then just hung up. Terrible service! And when we asked to talk to someone higher up the same lady answered and gave us a different name. Simply scammers! Never book through them!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T11:54:26.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

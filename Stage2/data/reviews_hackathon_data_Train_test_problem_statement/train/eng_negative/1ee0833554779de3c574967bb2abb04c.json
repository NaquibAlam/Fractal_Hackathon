Decided to order 3 more blackberry plants this spring. They never grew and are clearly not going to grow. I contacted Willis Orchards for replacements and they began by making me prove the plants were dead by sending photos & checking roots for growth -- which I did -- and then they STILL insisted that the plants would grow. They won't. They are dead. The guy emailing with me insisted that it is too early to see growth despite the fact that photos of the original plants I ordered clearly show they are in full growth mode. I kept pointing out that I live in Phoenix and that we haven't had a frost in 3 months and that everything here is either growing or is dead by now. Those plants are DEAD. They have now stopped emailing with me and have apparently chosen to hope I'll go away. I will go away, but I'll never ever order from them again. I will go back to places like Stark Bros & Logee's where customer service is as it advertises.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:38:11.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

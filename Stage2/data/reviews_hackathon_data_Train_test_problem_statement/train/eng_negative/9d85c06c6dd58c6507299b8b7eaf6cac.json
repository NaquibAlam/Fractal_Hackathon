It was only when the fire brigade turned up that we found out there had been a lot of issues with Subaru Foresters overheating and that this was not the first one that had caught fire that week. Apparently the office was aware of the issues with these cars and had been trying to get them recalled but rented one to us regardless. As a result of this incident one of our party missed their flight and was $360 out of pocket, a cost which the office did not cover.\nThe woman in the office was really lovely and arranged a ride for us back to our accommodation after the incident and then a ride into the city after we were done at the office the next day, and we had pleasant enough experiences with the Picton and Christchurch offices. This however does not outweigh the fact that through Omega's thoughtlessness, our lives were put at risk due to a faulty car. We will not be renting from Omega again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T14:10:06.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

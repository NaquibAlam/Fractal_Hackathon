I know that the airlines cancels the flights but I also know that it is not the customer's fault when this happens. I booked my flight from RDU to DKR for April 7. I booked it in January early in order not to worry about it anymore. For the past 2 months I have been getting emails of changes to my flights and cancellations nonstop. Today I got another email with cancellations of 2 flights but the alternatives don't even work together because ill miss some of the flights if I accept the alternatives. I have requested a refund and was told that I won't get a reply from them in 1-2 weeks A ticket to Africa is very expensive the more I wait to buy I will pay more if I don't get this money refunded in time to buy a new ticket!!! I am so upset I cried knowing how much this ruins my plans. This is the first time I booked with a company that has given me so much trouble. I am hoping for a quick resolve of this problem\nReviewing for the second time!!!! Update my booking has been cancelled in order to submit a request for a refund but I have not received an email stating as such. I should have received an email stating that my booking has been cancelled and that a request for a refund has been submitted. This is very upsetting and I regret making a booking with travelgenio I have never had a problem with other sites!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:18:10.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

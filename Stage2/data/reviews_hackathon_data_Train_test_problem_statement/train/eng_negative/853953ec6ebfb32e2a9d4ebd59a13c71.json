I'm not even watching a top team, I'm watching Chelsea v Crystal Palace!\nBought the tickets in January and after I had already bought the tickets they then only decided to tell me the seats I had were restricted view, AFTER I had paid the full amount. Got in contact with them as I wasn't happy & if I wanted to change the tickets I could but I had to pay an extra €50!!\nWhy they don't display it as pounds either I don't know?! Makes it annoying as I wasn't 100% on the amount coming out of my account!\nThe seller never ever put on my account that the tickets were dispatched, as I was given a link to track my order, was told they'd be here by the 27th, I panicked an contacted the company as I didn't think they'd come in time! The match was Saturday and I still hadn't reveiced them on the Tuesday! Their response was we'll contact the seller and asked me for the address of the hotel I was staying at so they could send my tickets to this hotel.\nDon't understand how a company can think it is acceptable to deliver such a high valued purchase to a hotel, how is that even secure??\nSo yes, massively over priced, weren't delivered on the day they said they would be and they have very little communication with the sellers.\nAlso forgot to mention, as soon as I said I was interested in buying the tickets, they rang me within 5 minutes, as soon as I asked where my tickets were all I had was a lousy email. Shows that's all they're concerned about is the money they make!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:30:44.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I went in on a Saturday to have them balance and rotate my tire after putting the first 5,000 miles on them, I also requested a four wheel alignment. After an hour and a half wait my car was ready, I pulled out of the lot and immediately sensed something was not right, when I got on the highway and let go of the wheel the car pulled hard to the right. I turned around and went back to the store and informed the staff that there was a major problem with the alignment, they tried two more time unsuccessfully to align my car. As it turns out they do not have the correct tools to align a newer Mercedes and I am now having to go spend more money at the dealership to get it properly aligned. They never told me this and just kept trying the same thing over and over. I will still buy tires there, but will never let them touch the alignment again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:41:05.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

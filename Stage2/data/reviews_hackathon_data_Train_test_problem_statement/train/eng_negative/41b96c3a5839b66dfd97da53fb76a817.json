I have never spent this kind of money on a toy like this before. I figured with all the glowing reviews it must be worth the extra money. Well, I am still yet to receive a product that works. The Form 2 I received in December would not turn on properly. It would only make loud shrill noises on the charging base. I followed all the troubleshooting suggestions and still nothing. I debated just demanding to get my money back, but decided I would give JImmyjane a second try. I went through the lengthy return process and followed their requests exactly. Returned the Form 2 along with cord/charging base. 2 months later...I received a little box in the mail that only has a Form 2 replacement in it. What am I supposed to do with that? They aren't going to return the charging base to me? Guess I will need to wait another 2 months to receive that. What a joke. Should have asked for a refund from the beginning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:48:09.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

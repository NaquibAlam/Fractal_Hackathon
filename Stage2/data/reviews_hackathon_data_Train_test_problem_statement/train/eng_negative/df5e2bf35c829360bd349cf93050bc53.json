Well, it is really easy you don´t receive the product but you are the responsable person who needs to pay afterwards the duty!\nY están diciendo que la entrega y la devolución está gratis!!! Mentira, vas a pagar las tasas!\nFurther more they expect you to be home all day! And even if you talked to the customer service to reschedule for another day and you going to tell that you just home at the evening, they don´t care, they will come the same day during the morning. So why do we have actually customer service if UPS afterwards does what it want´s, doesn´t matter, because if everything goes wrong don´t worry you are going to pay and don´t worry the payment you need to make won´t be cheap. And regarding them, they did fullfill their duty and tryed to deliver three times, so easy. In my case I bought two carpets, I called various times before to UPS and paid allready like 20 bugs for being just in line and just to lisen to cheap excuses. Delivery day was the 4th of january, but I dind´t received the goods and I dind´t received also a call neither did I received a note in my mail box. But don´t worry if UPS fails you going to pay afterwards! 44€, because it is your fault that you can´t be at home all day long, 3 days in a row and your are working.\nSo better make sure that you have in busy times 3 days free because if UPS can´t make it, you going to pay a lot for nothing!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T12:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T18:49:27.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

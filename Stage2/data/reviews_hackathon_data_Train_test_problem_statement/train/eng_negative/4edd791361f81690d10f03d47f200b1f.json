They are not Open and honest with their fees. It is $1000 to start and if they think they can help you then it is another $6995. You should know that upfront - That would be an honest Quote: for their services. More importantly - After we paid the second fee and gave them the addidtional Powers of Atty sent back to them overnight for quicker response! They LOST US. Literally - we fell through a crack and they lost us. After 6 weeks and hearing nothing, I called them and we had gotten lost between phase I and phase II even though we sent back docs immediately. They apologized (still more interest to IRS though) and now I get an email of a letter they are going to send to the IRS (after another 2 months) with IRS codes that back up why we shouldn't owe. Sounds good except that none of them have anything to do with our issue Just a stock generic letter that shows they still have not read any of the supporting documents sent in to them. I am wondering if they really do have any tax professionals or just a bunch of secretaries pushing paper. I would not use them again - I would seek out an independent Tax Attorney, not a big company - I am stuck for now but you should pursue other avenues!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T04:17:22.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

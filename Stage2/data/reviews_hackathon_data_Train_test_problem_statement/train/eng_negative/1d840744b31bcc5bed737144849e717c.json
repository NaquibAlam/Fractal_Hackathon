Never had a problem with quality of checks until NOW! The problem is with the images on the checks. They have always been bright....fun and vivid! Not with the ones I just received last week. I got the star fish on the beach they are beautiful on your website! Bright and colorful. NOT! Now I have two new boxes of washed out....faded out very pale and a grey cast over entire order. I hate them. They look so pretty on site. Don't know if printer wasn't working properly or your quality had gone down hill. Either way....HATE them. Don't want to go thru the cost of sending them back so I have them. It be nice if you'd redo them for me! Thank you. I can't reorder anymore not getting stuck again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:32:51.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

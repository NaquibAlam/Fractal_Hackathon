This tax was hard to notice since this tax was discreet added to the total sum while choosing payment. Neither was I informed that different payments could relsult in extra taxes in the \"box\" where i chose payment and gave up card information. This information was hidden (unlike all other extra services like e.g extra insurances), and you had to open a \"meny bar\" to see this cost. I didn't noticed this until after I had purcased the ticket and I would never have bought my ticked if I had seen this before clicking \"buy\". It's obvious to me that they intensionally didn't give better information about this extra tax. I findt this way of \"hiding\" extra costs disgusting and it's a petty way of \"tricking\" money from customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:56:21.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

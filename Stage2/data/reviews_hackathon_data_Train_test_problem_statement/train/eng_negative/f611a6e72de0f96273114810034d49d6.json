The installers did tell me that they would have to cut the mirror to get it up the stairs- which may have been easier but not entirely necessary. Nonetheless I was told it would be put on the wall 'together' accepting that there would be a 'seam' I accepted the plan. When I came up to see the finished product I was upset to see a 1/4 to 1/2 inch strip right up the middle of the mirror. It literally looks like two separate mirrors on the wall- right in the middle of course where you would naturally stand to do your workout! When I addressed the concern I was told it could be taken down but the wall is damaged and that will be mine to fix. I pressed for some resolution and was told again that after contacting the owner there is nothing we can do- but we can take it down and leave your wall damaged. And so I am left very disappointed and completely dissatisfied. I plan on reaching out to the company to again try for some resolution. Hopefully something can be done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:30:55.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I've kept the app even when one of your drivers REFUSED to return my wallet with all my ID's and over $700 cash. I kept an open mind because this was the first time that a driver has refused to return an item of mine and thus effectively stole it. However, the level of unprofessionalism and the increasingly high degree of unethical behavior (I had a driver the other day who KNEW that he was at the WRONG location but refused to cancel the ride when I ask him to for lack of internet connection on my end, claiming that it would affect his acceptance rate. This is unethical for the drivers to do (quite frankly unethical for LYFT to put drivers in a position where they would rather waste 5 minutes in order to keep their acceptance rate high). Drivers are consistently late because they can't follow GPS instructions for whatever reason (and I'm not the only one experiencing this); I was paired with a mentally incompetent driver and I am 100% certain of this (I've used lyft on an almost daily basis for approximately 2 years and I've never before suspected any of the drivers of mental incompetency).This was the last straw for me. Lyft engages in very subtle unethical practices (for ex, promising its drivers bonuses, that it fails to pay; 100% 150% 200% surges and I suspect based on the conversations I've had with drivers, many are often not made aware of these surges). I've a lot of respect for the drivers but Lyft ought to take the hiring process seriously and be more accountable to both drivers and passengers.\nI've started using Uber again and so far no complaints...the professionalism seems to have improved. My hope is for more competition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:13:14.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

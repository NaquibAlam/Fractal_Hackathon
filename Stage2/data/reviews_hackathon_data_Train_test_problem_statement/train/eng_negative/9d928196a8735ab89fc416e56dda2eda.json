We accidentally only booked 4 people online so we called immediately to correct this. We were told it would be an additional $250!! It had only been 10 minutes. We then asked to just cancel the whole thing so we could start over - again....a HUGE fee to do that. I was literally shaking I was so stressed out. You can not speak to anyone unless you are spending money...if you want to change or cancel you will be re-directed to another line that only rings no one is there to answer (we had 2 of us trying at the same time with the same experience). The lady I finally spoke to said \"well,, just go ahead and cancel then,if that's how you feel\". WOW!! Never again eDreams. My 4 girlfriends and I travel every year....you won't hear from us again. I shared my experience on social media as well....none of my people will book through your site and that's unfortunate...we are all at the traveling age and do it yearly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:50:04.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

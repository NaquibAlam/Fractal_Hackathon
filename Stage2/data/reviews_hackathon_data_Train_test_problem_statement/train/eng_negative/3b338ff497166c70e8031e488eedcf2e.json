However, when I opened the parcel, I discovered that the DVD was Region 2. I contacted Fishpond and was provided with a link to look up 'DVD hacks' to unlock my DVD player but if this didn't work, I could send the DVD back for a refund (of the item only and not postage costs).\nVery disappointed as this was supposed to be a gift!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:20:04.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Would have waited at the door for less than a minute as I opened the door to see him drive away.\nI contacted TNT to arrange a re-pickup and I was hung up because it was my fault and 'not of their concern'. I had to drop the package off myself to the Pack & Send depot (so much for a pick up and deliver service) and, when discussing with the Pack & Send representative in Glenelg I was told, \"you cant expect them to wait around all day while you wipe your butt\". (Cannot write in the review the explicit words as says inappropriate language)\nZero decency, zero customer service.\nI paid for 2-3 days delivery. Took 7 days and the delivery driver couldn't be bothered walking up a flight of stairs to the correct address so my sister, with new born, had to arrange to get it herself.\nAbsolutely Appalled. Would never do business with again or recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T09:55:21.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

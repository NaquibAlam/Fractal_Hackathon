I sold a Â£750 item on Gumtree and the buyer wanted the security of a possible resolution method in the event of problems. Now that is fair enough but nowhere on the headlines on the website is this pointed out. Still fair enough. Getting the money into my own bank was a farce. Why do they hang on to your money for up to 3 days ? (well you can guess) and they use your security and well being as an excuse. Imagine going to your bank and filling out forms in triplicate to make a withdrawal! It is calculated to make them money on top of the 2.9% i am sure.\nAnd just a warning. some years ago my daughter sold a big ticket item on Ebay and was paid via a stolen credit card, which was not reported for three days. Ebay then demanded the payment returned and Paypal threatened to put it in the hands of debt collectors if the money was not transferred back to them immediately. In dealing with them on the phone i found they couldn't care less. Despite being advised by a solicitor and the fraud department of the police that the demand from Paypal should be ignored I told her to return the money as she did not need a CCJ hanging over her.\nPaypal showed their true colours on that occasion.

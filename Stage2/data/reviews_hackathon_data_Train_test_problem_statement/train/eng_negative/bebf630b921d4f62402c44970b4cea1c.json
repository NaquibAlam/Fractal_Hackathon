The material seems very thin and cheap in certain areas. It has pulled apart in numetous areas now. I have now been waiting for over 6 months for a promised replacement. I worked with Dajuan (sp?) the manager in the Tampa, FL store. Every time I would call and leave a message he would not call back. I had to keep calling and emailing him trying to find out what was going on. I was told for about 3 months now they are waiting for the replacement from the manufacturer. I just want my recliner sofa replaced with a quality piece or offer me something similar.

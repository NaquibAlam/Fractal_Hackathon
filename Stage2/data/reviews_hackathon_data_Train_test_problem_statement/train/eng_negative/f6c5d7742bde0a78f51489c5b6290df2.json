I got my confirmation email first with the bookingcode etc. But never got my etickets. Instead i got an email saying the creditcard verification process had failed, but the amount of money was already off from my creditcard balance. As a student my creditcard limit is not high, so after this booking i now can not use my creditcard again to purchase another ticket as most websites only accept creditcards. Just HORRIBLE!!! & there is no way of contacting them, the number doesnt work from other countries!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:21:46.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

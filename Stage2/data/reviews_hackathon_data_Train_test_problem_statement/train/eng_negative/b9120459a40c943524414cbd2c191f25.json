You'll get your money in 3 weeks\"\nBlocking my money for 1,5 month because... ...it's fun doing it.\nKeep in mind that the product never arrived in my hands, not even at the store. The refund should be done immediately.\nVandenborre, you must improve the system. I can get refunded in a shorter time frame when I buy abroad. We live in the computer world with order numbers, account numbers, emails, ticketing systems, internal network applications with enterprise service-oriented architecture.\nThis refund is a national transfer. I cannot accept that you need 3 weeks to acknowledge that I don't have the product when you never gave it to me, and to make an automatic national transfer to my bank account.\nDo you really need 3 weeks? Is that your standard? Than you need to employ more people in the accounting department.\nYou keep explaining: \"It's always 3 weeks.\" And I keep saying \"It's always not polite to keep money from customers with no reason\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T21:14:41.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I make a order 3 days before Valentine's day, everything was going smooth until the Vday morning, when i received mail that supplier doesn't have the flower, but they have a different one. I tried to call them, none answer all the phones they have! chat is useless, waiting 2 hours, and if you don't \"lost\" the connection, they will not answer you the questions! email none answering too!! so just waste the money and whole day, because I can't find another supplier in end of Valentine day!!!! I hate them!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T04:28:22.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

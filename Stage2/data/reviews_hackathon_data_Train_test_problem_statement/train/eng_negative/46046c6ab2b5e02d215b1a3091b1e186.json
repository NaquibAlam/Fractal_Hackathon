After all that I've seen we are in our third module we only have five modules for the associates degree I'm wondering now as I think about it do they really care whether we get a job or not. Most of us are low income we are trying to better yourself by getting in debt up to our necks. Most of us are close to 60 years old. Why can't these people at the Allen School be honest with us. And tell us that we are probably too old to get a job. Then we have to get certified that's more money period we are just racking up student loan after loan that we will probably spend the rest of our lives trying to pay off. But that's okay because no one was really honest with us at the beginning. I know students that have taken and gotten their certificate for medical billing and coding. But we'll never the able to get a CPC certification so that's money we're paying on for nothing. I also learned that one of the instructors has been fired in the Mist of her husband passing away. The professor was told that she had missed too many classes period have a heart people. As I see it this moment I believe that Allen School is heartless. That's just my opinion no one else's just mine. You wanted me too tell the truth. So there it is. I will never recommend anyone to attend Allen School of health and science. I feel that most of us were taken advantage of. I will always feel that way. So that's my opinion hope you enjoy it and I know you won't print it even though you say you will I'll be waiting to read my opinion on your website have a great day get a conscience God bless", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T11:20:53.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Three days later I get an email from their fraud dept. telling me that because the shipping address is different than the billing address on the credit card I need to down load a form sign and fax back to them in order to order to have my item shipped.\n1: I did not buy with a credit card, I used PayPal.\n2: The shipping address is my PayPal \"Confirmed\" shipping address, same one I have used for 10 years through countless eBay, amazon orders!\nThis is not rocket science, speed tech and if it was you would be left behind. Nobody uses fax any more!\nI spoke to their \"fraud blond\" nothing but air in there!\nI cancelled the order, had them refund back to PayPal account on principle.\nSet them an email telling them What I thought, no reply!\nBottom line: No intelligent life at speedtech lights. Look at the responses to the negative reviews, Generic responses from a ghost, they care so little about customer service they don't even include a persons name in the response.\nSpeedTech talks the talk, but does not walk the walk!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:21:51.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Rep stated he would call Tough Country to gain tracking details and call back with info. No return call ever received.\n1/13 - Called KT Performance again to receive tracking details. Rep called Tough Country, and he indicated Tough Country was finishing up bumper build and they would ship by Tuesday, 1/17.\n1/20 - Tierd of the run around, I contacted Tough Country directly. They indicated the bumper would not be built for another 2-3 weeks and it would ship then. What the hell, now the story differs.\nBottom line, if the merchandise is going to ship from the manufacturer, KTPerformance should note that on their website and indicate it could be 4-8 weeks before you receive the product. The shipping details (yes I simulated another order) failed to say anything regarding the log jam concerning this bumper. However KTP was quick to charge my credit card. My first and last order with this company. I saw some mixed reviews regarding the organization, but decided to give them a try.

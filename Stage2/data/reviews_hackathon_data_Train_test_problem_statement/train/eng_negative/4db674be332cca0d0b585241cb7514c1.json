As of today, February 6th, I STILL have not received my order nor have I had any updates on delivery. I have paid over $20 for shipping, albeit, I am in Hawaii, but I would think that if I am paying that much for shipping, it would not take over two weeks to receive it. I got my shipping notification the same day I made my order from UPS. Great! It's being shipped via UPS! There was no estimated delivery date, but hey, that's okay because UPS is relatively fast. January 25th, one week later, I check the status, and it says that it has reached California and transferred to the USPS! No notification via email. If I didn't check myself, I wouldn't have known. There's no link to track for USPS, so I need to go onto another website to check the status, and now the estimated delivery date is today, February 6th! Well, the mail has come and gone, and I still do not have my order. I am VERY disappointed to say the least. If I had some notification or estimated delivery time frame in the beginning when I ordered that it would take this long (what I ordered was a gift and the child's birthday has past already), I probably would not have ordered this item, especially with the cost of the shipping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T23:44:05.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

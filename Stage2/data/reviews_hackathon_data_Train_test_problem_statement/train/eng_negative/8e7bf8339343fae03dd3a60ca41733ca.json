They say once the tracking shows the products arrive they will release funds in 3 days. They don't. I've had to manually go through 200 items at the cost of countless hours of my time to get my funds released. Have multiple hours of bad customer service recorded and am working on a media story about this. On top of that, they released my account hold 12 days ago and now have placed it back on my account. This is just wrong. The customer service SUPERVISOR told me this morning that he could assure me the hold was ONLY for the one larger transaction and that all of my other TRANSACTIONS would process okay. I made him wait while I had my wife purchase a $6 item where in fact my funds were held (complete lie). The only option is to wait 21 days for my money or spend hours on the phone going through transactions. This company is engaged in unfair trade practices, racketeering and fraud. Representing to a customer/seller that you will not hold their money in order to induce them to continue accepting payments on your system, when this is not true is wire fraud and a violation of FTC regulations. I expect someone in your 'back office' --as they call it --(who is a decision maker and a human in America not reading from a computer screen) to reach out to me via facebook messenger and provide me with their direct line, or I will be reporting this ongoing issue, with 15 recorded phone calls of completely conflicting information to the Federal Trade Commission, the FBI and the media.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:07:25.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

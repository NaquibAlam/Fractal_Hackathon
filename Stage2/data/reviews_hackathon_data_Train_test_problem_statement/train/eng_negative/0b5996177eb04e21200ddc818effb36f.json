The 4 seasons is smooth with no lip or indentation for a hose clamp to secure against like the picture shows and the part looks nothing like the advertised part picture at all. On classic cars we need originality for judging. And this part is cheaper at your local auto stores. I ordered and was willing to pay more for original.

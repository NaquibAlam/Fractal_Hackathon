They processed second order and asked pay for first order Western Union, that I had no any buyer protection and they so easy could scam me, I refused and told I want pay via credit card for have buyer protection. Then they told ok use for first order Verified by visa password like you used for second order. They are crazy I not used for second order Verified by visa password because I have no any Verified by visa password at all, I have written to them about it and then they stole my second order too. I try 5 days solve situation, but I have feeling that support it is or bot or spit on clients. They write same info many times and not read client messages at all. If they will solve case I will change me review, but for now they are seems like big scammers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:56:10.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Goldcar agent there wanted to sell me damage excess insurance,( as I hire cars often I have an annual policy), I would guess the agents are on commission as she was pretty abrupt with me. Asked if I was covered if someone smashed the car windows. Couldn't properly examine the car at the airport garage as it was quite dim in there and the cars are tightly parked. However next morning I did examine, there were a few minor dents not shown on the car check out diagram but worst of all one of the front tyres was 50% bald and the rubber showed signs of perishing. Wasted half a days holiday in taking it back and getting another - no apology.\nTheir fuel policy is another rip off, I paid Â£24.90 on collection for a full tank of petrol and returned the car with half a tank. I was given a refund but charged for them to fill the car up again a nett extra of 20 Eur.\nI have written several times to complain but all I get is their customer service standard letter saying how wonderful their service is.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:04:20.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

She wears a 2x from all the other stores we deal with, but this 2x is actually a size 14. I called Prom Girl within 15 minutes of delivery to get return authorization. I was told that I will only get credit I am not happy with that as they have very little in a true 2x. I will not be dealing with them again. Please realize that you must check your measurements of each and every dress as they all are different. A 2x in one will not fit a 2x in another.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:46:39.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My order number Order No. 1720122595 was so shabbily treated. I paid up the full amount via my visa card only to be asked for the account statement from the credit card company. When i provided that I was asked for a utility service bill in order to establish my credentials all over again. The credit card statement comes to my office and the utility bill asked for had my residential address of course! I have been told that they cant process my order DESPITE THE FACT THAT MY CARD HAS BEEN DEBITED FOR THE FULL AMOUNT.\nI am told by this esteemed company that my money will be refunded in 7 working days...am still waiting.\nI buy extensively online from all over the world and also pay for a lot of services such as travel etc. But this is the first time that I have had this horrifying experience with an online portal. ITS THE WORST EVER SITE AND WOULD ADVISE EVERYONE TO STAY AWAY FROM IT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T05:54:54.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

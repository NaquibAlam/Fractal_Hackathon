This store is the worst. I ordered stuff December 12 th. My order was shipped the 25th. Out of 15 items received 5, the rest was back ordered( never got any message about back ordered items) Contacted customer service on the phone - nobody ever answers it , you wait for 30 min on hold then they hang up. so i wrote an email. They apologized for not contacting me, and let me know that items that i ordered were discontinued by manufacturer. And they will refund my money but refund reqest takes up to 30 business days and refund itself may take up to 10 days. Do you believe how ridiculous that is. Wait for my money back 40 business for items that i never received. That is my second purchase with them, first time they send me shoes with broken strap never responded tomy emails...Never will shop there again.\nAs you asked my order number is 101977633\nYou are damn right i opened case with paypal. I want my money back, soon will be 4 months since my purchase, how long it takes you to refund money for items i never received! You are fraud and its a shame!!! Unbelievable I will never shop there again and i will spend my time to write horrible reviews on every possible website to warn other people from making mistake i made!!!!\nOn top of all that i forgot to add that items you sent me weren't new, definitely was worn by someone else and panties area was dirty.

First game in YEARS. I'm sure someone could imagine my excitement. I paid a coupled hundred dollars for the tickets and wanted to get a new jersey. I placed my order for a hat and a jersey on 1 March and paid for 3 day shipping. My \"custom\" jersey was shipped on the 2nd. A few minutes ago I checked on the status of my jersey and it said it wasn't going to be delivered by COB on 10 March. THE HOCKEY GAME IS ON THE 9TH. So obviously something doesn't make sense here. I spent all of that money and this crappy company can't do SIMPLE math. If my order shipped out on the 2nd, the latest it should've arrived at my house is today. That's me adding an extra day in there because of Sunday. I'm not sure how you guys are still in business. I'll be reporting you to the BBB.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:38:27.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

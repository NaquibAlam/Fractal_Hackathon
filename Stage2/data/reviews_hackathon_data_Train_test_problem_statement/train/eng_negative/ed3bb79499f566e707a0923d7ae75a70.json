The \"cheap fares\" are B.S., you will never save money flying with thieves!\nI spoke to Bravofly and Easyjet before booking two tickets, one for an unaccompanied minor. They confirmed to me the minor could fly with his older brother so I bought the two tickets. One of the tickets went through and the other was \"pending\" until I called several hours later to find out why it was pending. They told me they had cancelled one of the tickets, saying they don't allow unaccompanied minors. They then refused to cancel the first ticket for my older child, although I was in the 24 hour federal time slot allowing me to cancel my ticket with no penalty (this is a U.S. Federal Law covering all tickets purchased by people located in the USA). I had no need for the first ticket, since I needed my boys to travel TOGETHER.\nI called five different times to try to speak to a supervisor, or ANYONE who wasn't extremely rude and unhelpful. No luck. They were so disgusting, they actually hung up the phone on me or yelled at me.\nI am disputing the charges with my credit card company. This company is a scam, don't waste your time or money\nTo Bravofly: Your COMPANY's days are ALMOST UP. Your dishonesty and thievery and disregard for customers is catching up with you. I look forward to seeing you out of business! '", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:48:29.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

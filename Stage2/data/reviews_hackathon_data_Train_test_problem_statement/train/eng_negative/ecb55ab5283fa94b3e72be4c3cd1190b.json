Online it looks like an amazing deal- but don't be fooled!!\nI got the full service for £139 which I thought was a great deal- and then I asked for spark plugs extra (which was ridiculous as most services do them as standard) -anyway I was told they were £43 inclusive of fitting and VAT. I get a call to tell me my car was ready and the bill was £235 BUT no engine coolant or brake fluid had been topped up because they needed replacing- wrong! I paid to have them all replaced 8 months ago so I know you were just trying to get extra money out of me. The privilege of this was £125 plus vat.\nWhen I questioned why the bill was £235 when it should have been £182 as that was what I was Quote: d he said the spark plugs were £79.99 plus vat!! Spark plugs have never been £80!! I told him I was told last week they were £41 and he said that prices change daily and I had to book them in advance- which I did, last week! He agreed to 'honour' last weeks price (how nice!!!) but I had to pay vat on it. Online your price of £43 inclusive of Vat.\nSo basically I have just paid you £189.50 (oh yeah- you have to pay £1 for the privilege of using your own debit card!!) for some checks, 4 new spark plugs and some new oil. No other fluid in my car has been touched!!\nabsolutely will not be using this service again- it's ridiculous!!!\nOh and 'we collect and deliver your car for free' - yeah and spank half of my petrol in the process and bring my car back stinking of cigars???? Terrible!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:43:45.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

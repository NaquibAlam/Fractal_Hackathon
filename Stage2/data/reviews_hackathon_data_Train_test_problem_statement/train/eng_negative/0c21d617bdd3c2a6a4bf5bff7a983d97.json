Staff at Barcelona office Oscar and Alessandro very rude. First when I arrived had to wait 15 mins for pick up bus. Then went to office, kids very thirsty put 1 Euro in vending machine nothing came out. Asked the lady sitting at counter, she said machine faulty. Ok if machine faulty staff should put a sign, wasted my 2 euros. Very rude attitude. Was given Fiat 500L suppposed to be automatic car, but I could not figure out how to put the Gear. Asked help from Oscar, he briefly showed me how to put the gear. Somehow I drove to Santa Susana, the car kept on giving trouble with the gear. Next day called the office they were not ready to hel and asked me to drive to Barcelona to change car. Called your customer support a lady spoke to Barcelona office and arranged to send recovery. Recovery guy said it was not a fully automatic car but a semi automatic car. The office decided to send a replacement a fully automatic car. This new car no problem. When I returned to your office to return the car. I told the staff how it affected our 1 full day because of wrong car they gave us. I asked for some refund, but this guy Alessandro had a very rude attitude. I aske to speak to manager he said there was no manager at the site and I call tommorow. He called my wife stupid, as she was not happy with the service provided. Both Alessandro and Oscar kept speaking in Spanish looking at us. I said it was very rude to speak in different language in front of English speaking customer, they did not listen and kept doing it. As I running late I left the car at ur site and went to Airport with my family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T14:04:40.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

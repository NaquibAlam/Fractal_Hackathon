I requested a label so I could ship it back and all I kept getting is that I have to pay for the shipment to be returned. I think that I shouldn't have to pay for it; since my shipment was damaged. They still won't give me a label to send it back. Its costing me more money to ship it back and I don't have the money. $128 is a lot. I only have 30 days to get it back or I have to pay for the whole item. Customer service wasn't very helpful, all I kept getting is that I have to pay to send it back, but, I supposed to hear from UPS. But I don't even know if there coming to pick it up. The lady in customer service wouldn't give me a straight answer; when I asked questions about the UPS. I'm not going to do business with them ever again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:31:42.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

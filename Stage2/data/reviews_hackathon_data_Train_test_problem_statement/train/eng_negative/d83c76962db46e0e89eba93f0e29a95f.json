Had belongings stored in Melbourne but was living in Sydney which seem too confuse staff quiet a lot even with telling them my stuff was in Melbourne so was always passed back and fourth. Was given wrong information when signing up which lead us to being behind in our first payment. Spent a couple of months with that problem but the worse was having my taxi boxes dropped off and my locks cut and no one at the property so my things were free to take. Now I did ask for my locks to be cut as I lost the keys and have them replaced which needed to be paid for but I went in to the office to do this myself. Now after this happening i asked to be refunded the new locks which they kindly did but no without abit of drama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T17:47:52.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Spurs v millwall fa cup quarter final. C. Eriksen to score first, spurs to win 5-0. £10 stake at odds 60/1. Eriksen scored first and spurs lead 2-0 at halftime. I logged onto my account at halftime interested to see how much the cash out figure was going to be. Once I selected my open bets, highlighted in green \"won\" £610. Therefore the bet was closed and no cash out figure had been Quote: d. Happy days...or so I thought. The game finished 6-0 to spurs. No money was credited to my account & paddy power deny any knowledge of ever updating the bet to \"won\" £610. Be careful it seems to me that they knew that they would have to offer a decent cash out figure in the second half so therefore negated my bet at halftime & a bookie being bookie took the chance of the game not finishing 5-0. At this time paddy power claim that in la liga, champions league & premier league games if your team goes 2-0 at anytime they will pay you as a winning bet. This does not include the fa cup. I am assuming that my account was updated to \"won\" £610 in error. The frustrating part is the fact that they took away my ability to cash out for the rest of the game including when spurs went 5-0. This option I would have considered....but didn't have to as I had \"won\" £610. Racketeers...steer well clear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:26:48.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

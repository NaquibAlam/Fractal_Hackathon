So I placed a bulk order to save on shipping cost. However, an item was missing upon receiving the package.\nI emailed support immediately and their response was to refund me as it didn't make sense for them to re-ship.\nFirstly, their refund did not include the delivery cost that I've already paid based on shipment weight.\nSecondly, by asking the customer to re-order the missing item and pay for another shipping fee isn't fair. This should be a cost covered by the company for running a retail business and not at the expense of the customer.\nThis company don't care and backup their name when things go south.

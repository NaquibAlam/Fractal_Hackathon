More than a week before the holiday - other vendors were giving notice items were in (or backorder) stock/inventory and most were shipping in time for arrival by the holiday - with an estimate of the day. Frames Direct gave no such information, this lack of transparency leads me to never use this site again. The frames arrived 2 full weeks after Christmas. Buyer beware of course (I did order from the site even without knowing the backorder status), but when most other online stores are mostly transparent about inventory and shipping. Frames Direct was NOT. I felt mislead and ripped off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:08:03.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

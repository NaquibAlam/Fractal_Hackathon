I am having issues with booking my seat with Air India flight operated by Air Canada (AI Flight 7312 and AI Flight 7343) from Toronto to London and London to Toronto because you have not provided me PNR no for Air Canada because your system did not generate it. You need to fix this problem ASAP becuase your employees have given me a really hard time. I called both Air India and Air Canada airline with regards to this issue.Air Canda agents advised that they are not having any pnr no for us inorder to book our seats. They can't find any hold of a seat for me and my fellow passenger(Upinder kaur LNU). I was on call with flight hub last night until 2 am in morning. It was my worst experience.\nI will never boook any of my tickets with flight hub ever in future if this issue will not be resolved until next 1hour. Moreover, customer service was not at all good. They just asked me to provide confirmation number to air canada or e ticket no to book seats but you dont understand that air canda has different reference number (6 digits alphanumeric) which is missing. Even last night one of your customer representative hold my call for 1 hr and she never came back on call. Please mind that dont call and bother me again just fix it by an hour or two at the most. Otherwise, I will take legal action against you guys. Don't take this lightly, I really mean it. If you don't want to lose your valuable customer fix the issue by providing me the Air Canada 6 digit alphanumeric reference number, this is all I need from you guys\nWaiting for a positive and your immediate response on this. Thank you in advance for taking this into consideration", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:25:29.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

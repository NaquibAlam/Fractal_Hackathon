I much prefer the system my last provider had of a fixed sum paid monthly and occasionally adjusted to take account changes in use. Far easier to manage your finances & household budget. It is also irritating to have to be asked to read the meter just before the bill is produced. People have got enough to do without having to do your job of reading the meter. This was not the case with my last provider either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:18:02.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

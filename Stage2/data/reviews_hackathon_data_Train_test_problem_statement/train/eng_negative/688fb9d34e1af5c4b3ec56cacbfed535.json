The Peterborough showroom version showed the same fault and even they admitted that they couldn't install it either!. We also had a bespoke sink unit manufactured by them, with a Tap that we were assured should work . Yeah - Right!!\nWell it all didn't work!.\nWe advised Peterborough that we required products that were fit for purpose under the Consumer law and Trading Standards, only to be told to contact their customer services. What a laugh!.\nPeterborough were given notice in June 16 that they had 30 days to rectify the faults, which they did not, emails received from Mr S from Porcelanosa , were outside the timeline under UK Law. Our Credit Card were informed and took action.\nWhat followed could not be written as a comedy script:- initially total denial that they were breaching UK law, then offering to send their maintenance engineers to fix the shower enclosure and Tap in early sept 16.\nGiven that the Consumer Act only allows 30 days this was a joke!.\nAny way we entertained this idiot from Sani fix! (subsidiary of Porcelanosa) His attendance was unbelievable, he had no knowledge of the tap issue, even though we had an email from there so called customer services ( Mr S) saying that this would be fixed at the same time of fixing the shower door (which had been unusable since June 16 ) !.\nWe only wanted them on-site to fix the shower door, and in doing so he defrauded the company by saying he had supplied and fixed 4 hinges rather than the two he had installed!). After which, he proceeded to trash the whole installation, including the shower installation. Funny that, given that my brother-in-law had just moved to a new house -- and the shower installation was the same as ours - except it worked!. However, he did admit that the shower unit problem was known - 2 mths before we accepted purchase!\nIn the meantime, having exceeded UK law, this company started sending emails which contained increasing misinformation, and each one contradicted the previous (Mr V). It soon transpired that that Porcelanosa customer services were staffed by - deaf, dumb and blind individuals (Mr S -Who is an outright liar); , Ms B who can not respond to emails, and Mr V - who is so incompetent it is unbelievable).\nAnyway, this company has now been found to have breached UK Law in supplying goods that are not fit for purpose , we now have our money back and are now starting from scratch again with companies who are professional and not cowboys!!.\nUse at your at cost!\nIf you de3al with this company -- on your own head be it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T21:52:21.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

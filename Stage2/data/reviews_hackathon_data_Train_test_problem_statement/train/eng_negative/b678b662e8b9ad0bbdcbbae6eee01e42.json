The delivery time is stated as 3-8 days... Today is Feb 14th, more than 30 DAYS LATER, and there is no bed in my house yet and no expected delivery date from the transportation company!!!\nIt feels Emob takes NO RESPONSIBILITY for the transportation and delivery! They only blame Hermes for an apparent \"system failure\"!!???? That has taken more than 15 days, and I still have no idea when I will receive the bed???? What a joke! I'm starting to think this site is a complete scam and will look into where I can report it! Especially if I don't see this review posted in their website...\nBelow is a detail description of the facts:\nAfter many calls to Emob client service number, only on Jan 27 I got an email saying It was on its way... After that, more than 10 days went by without hearing from Emob nor from the transportation company (Hermes), I then contacted Emob several times by email and phone and the only thing they said was that the transportation company was going to call me. In one of the emails they even said they \"kindly asked the transportation company to call me the next day\", and I got no call from Hermes of course.... Two days later I finally got a call from Hermes saying the bed would be delivered on the following Monday between 13-18:00... Guess what? Today is Thursday midday and no bed has been delivered and no call from Hermes to re-schedule the delivery!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:30:21.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

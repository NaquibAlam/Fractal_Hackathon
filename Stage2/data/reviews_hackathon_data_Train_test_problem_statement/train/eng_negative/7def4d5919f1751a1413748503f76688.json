I also asked for a phone number where I could reach them and instead they emailed back and told me to use their live chat. However they have no live chat service on their website. now they are not responding to me. I believe they are waiting until after 24 hours to send me another message back at which time they will tell me I am no longer able to cancel my order. However I have a record of all my emails sent to them. I will pursue this further until I receive a refund and I will also contact other sources to make sure that this company gets known for its bad customer service and the lies they tell with respect to how I can contact them. I have now asked them at least three times in email to cancel my order. I received one message telling me they are sorry that I want to cancel my order and to let them know if I still want to cancel my order. Again, they are stalling on refunding me and cancelling my order. I replied again and told them that yes I still do want to cancel my order. I have also asked for a valid phone number for where I can reach a customer service agent, but I'm not sure I will ever get one. This is one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with.\nUPDATE -- now they tell me they are going to refund my money and cancel my order (I will have to wait and see if the charge is reversed on my credit card for 3-5 business days). However, they STILL did not provide me with a valid phone number where I can call them to discuss my complaint and let them know why I am canceling my order. This is very poor customer service when you don't provide a valid phone number for a customer to call. In addition, they indicate they have a LIVE chat service but they do not and now they lie about it. Other customers have complained about the same thing. Why tell a customer that you have a live chat service when you do not? At least be honest!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:25:41.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

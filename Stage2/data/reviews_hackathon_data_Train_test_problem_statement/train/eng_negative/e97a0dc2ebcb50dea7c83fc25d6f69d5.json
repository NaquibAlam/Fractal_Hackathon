In reality, we choose Thalys because this is the only existing option to transit between Amsterdam and Paris.. and there is no existing competition from Ryanair or Easy jet YET.\nBesides being highly pricy, the trains run in an unorganised way from Amsterdam central or Schiphol. Meaning no clear display of the platform until 5min before it arrives (and I am generous here). No Thalys staff to guide you either. For example today my train overall stayed 1 min on the platform for a 16h34 schedule from Schiphol to Paris and I missed this 135 euros train today like that. Less than 1 min later, it was not displayed anymore and other intercity trains ran on the platform. I had hope that the controller for the next train could have some pity, as i was told at the Thalys counter...but he made me pay 124 euros for the same trip.\nTrip where I have no seat assigned and on my receipt it just says \"no ticket\". Like an outcast that fraud to be on this 0 star train.. I am pretty angry and disappointed of the lack of compassion and understanding.\nIn clear you pay 259 euros for being sat next to the door and also told that they cannot do anything for you. That this is your Fault.\nAVOID THALYS, better the car sharing, having nice people respecting you !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T14:47:24.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

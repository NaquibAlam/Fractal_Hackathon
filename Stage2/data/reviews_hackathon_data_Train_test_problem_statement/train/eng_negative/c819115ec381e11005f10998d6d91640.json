(order never arrived, shipping from china, yada yada yada) So, if so many people have so many issues with NEVER receiving orders, and dresslily is only refunding HALF of the order price of ALL these people, imagine how much money they're making off of \"shipped\" orders, that magically, just NEVER arrive anywhere? I'm sure that DressLily will respond to this negative rating and remind me that I did not purchase the shipping insurance, which is fine. (honestly, I don't even remember it being an option when I checked out, so they couldn't have made that big of a deal about making sure I knew it was offered, and what the consequences would be if I didn't get it!!) There is ZERO thought put into the people responding to you. The only thing they use are form letters. I guess when you have probably 100's of complaint emails you have to respond to everyday, form letters are just easier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T20:13:16.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

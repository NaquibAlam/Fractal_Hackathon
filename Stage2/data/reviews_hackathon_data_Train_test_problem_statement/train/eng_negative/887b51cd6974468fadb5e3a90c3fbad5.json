When I looked at the smaller photos of the wig at different angles, I noticed they had included a really \"crappy\" wig. The caption at the top of the page describing the wig said it was \"gray\" But the photo I ordered from looked multi shades of grays. I should have clued in, but didn't. When I got the wig I nearly fell over in shock. I got the crappy gray wig...Not what I thought I ordered. There was no warning about sending the crappy wig, just a big enticing photo of the one I wanted. I have tried to explain things to the customer service department and they keep telling me it's what I ordered, send them photos and return the wig. I paid enough money for it and it would cost almost as much to send it back. Today they let me know they sent another order, I suspect is a wig and most likely the same crappy one. I found the wig I wanted on line with another more expensive company and realized they must have copied the photo of the expensive wig and put it on their site to entice me to buy it. Is this not misleading and defrauding information about the product? I will have no further dealings with Lightinthebox and will refuse the new package when it comes. I have wasted enough time and money dealing with them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T07:31:05.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Im so disappointed i didn't get to purchase everything i was hoping to obtain. i hope the leggings are long enough for me because Im sure ill get the run around if i want to return them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T18:02:44.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

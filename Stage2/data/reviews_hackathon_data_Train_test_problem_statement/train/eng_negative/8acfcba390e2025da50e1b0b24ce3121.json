After 5 days the item had not been sent so I decided to cancel the purchase.\nFishpond charged me a $5 restocking fee despite never having shipped the item. They also charged my credit card for the item despite saying I would only be charged once the item was shipped. They sent an email advising I was refunded but this has not been processed on my credit card.\nThey are a drop shipper with a 10-30 day turnaround time. They then charge a restocking fee if consumers decide 10-30 days is too much. Refunds are impossible to get and items are rarely received as they literally hold nothing in stock.\nMany 1 star reviews. Unsure if the higher reviews are genuine as many people with similar issues.\nExtremely dodgy. Please don't waste time or money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T14:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T11:30:59.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

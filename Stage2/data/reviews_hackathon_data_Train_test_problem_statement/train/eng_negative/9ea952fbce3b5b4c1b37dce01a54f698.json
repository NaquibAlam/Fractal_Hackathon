When i brought this up to customer service for each individual order they told me that the products were not counterfeit and they couldn't see the comparison between what I received and what was described. The font's of the labels are different, the packaging is off and the products themselves were faulty and not quite right. Everything is unsellable for my business. DHGate refuses to right the wrongs and keeps siding with the manufacturers on certain products. I've lost a lot of money and precious time dealing with this company. If something seems too good to be true guess what it usually is and thats what you'll get with DHGate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T10:46:35.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

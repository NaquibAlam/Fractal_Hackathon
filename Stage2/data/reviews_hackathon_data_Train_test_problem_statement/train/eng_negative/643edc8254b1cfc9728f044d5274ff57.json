I paid for rush delivery for first thing this morning to a hospital knowing my friend would probably be discharged today. The arrangement was supposed to arrive by 10 am, but half an hour later still no delivery confirmation. I call the company, and she indicates my delivery time is supposed to be today by 10 am. Yes, no kidding, that's why I'm calling. The rep puts me on hold and says she apologizes for the delay, but they cannot locate the flowers because they are on a delivery truck somewhere. She cannot give me a time frame they will arrive, just that it will be sometime today. I told her this isn't good enough because the patient may be discharged later, so she asks for my friend's home address to deliver the flowers there if she has, in fact, been discharged by then. I told her I do not have my friend's address, and the whole point was to send her flowers in the hospital.\nShe offered to refund my rush fee, to which I responded I will get more than that refunded. It would have been nice if someone had at least told me the flowers were going to be late. But, this way makes it much easier for them to keep their rush delivery fee and just hope I'm not paying attention.\nFor a large company, I expected more. I learned my lesson for next time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:09:12.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have spent 4 days trying to re-book 2 airplane tickets. The customer service has given me the run around consistently. I called Air Canada and they confirmed the lack of service and knowledge by the Flight Hub employees. It feels as if they are refusing to allow me to use the $1,057.84 credit I have with them. I have asked to speak to a supervisor 2 times and both times the person \"is not available\". After speaking with so many of the employees at Flight Hub, I can guarantee you that the call center is not located in North America as it is difficult to understand every person I have spoken with. Very POOR customer service!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:44:28.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

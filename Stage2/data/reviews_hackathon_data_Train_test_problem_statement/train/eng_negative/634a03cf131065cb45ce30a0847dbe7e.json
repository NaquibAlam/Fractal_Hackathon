I booked the flight under my maiden name (my passport was under my maiden name) but unfortunately my passport got damaged and I was told to get a new one. Because I started the process of legally changing my name, I HAD to get my new passport in my married name. I called New Zealand Air and sent them all my information - they said it was possible but I had to go through Flight Hub. I have been on the phone with Flight Hub almost every day (minimum 1 hour calls... most of the time on hold) and every day I am given an excuse or a change in story or a different reason why they cannot change my name, blaming Air New Zealand, blaming policy, blaming me. In all honesty - I didn't want to get a new passport, but unfortunately I did. Now I just need help to solve this issue but two weeks have passed, the price of the flight keeps going up and I still have no idea if I will be going on this trip. The customer service has been so rude they have brought me to tears more than once. I just need to change my name on my ticket and I can't understand why this is so impossible especially when Air New Zealand had all the information and said yes they would do it! They have told me they would call me back with information and never have. I have to call every day and they are saying Air New Zealand isn't opened although I can call on the other line and they are there.\nI cannot believe a company operates this way. I cannot believe customer service would treat someone this way, and I can't believe I may not be going on a trip because of a lack of customer service - the exact reason they are there. I will never ever use Flight Hub again - I will tell everyone and anyone about this experience and I can't believe I am being penalized because my name has been legally changed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T17:05:42.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Delivered my stuff to wrong address, 3 blocks down the street more than once. Never ring the bell just plop it down and off they go. If the box is heavy its not getting plopped at the door either, its going to be in the driveway at roadside.Thats if they get it right at all. I actually had an argument with them once because a 2 part shipment was a light box and a heavy box. The light one arrived. When I called in the woman said the heavy box was there in her office and not to worry, its Friday see and no one wanted to lift heavy on Friday. Someone will come Monday. No lie, that happened. Another time the box came wet and smelling like pee. Called in and they said they had a chemical spill on the truck ... OK so you just deliver wet with chemical? Then they backtracked and said there was an animal shipment .. so it was pee? Then they backtracked again.\nAt least they named it right puroLATER", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:10:44.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Dickmanns seems to do that systematically and when you call or email them they will tell you for months that your request has been passed on to accounting, but nothing happens. There is something you can do, however: Get in touch with your credit card company and start the chargeback procedure as soon as possible. You will need a copy of your contract and will have to explain what happened and the credit card company will refund your deposit and charge Dickmanns. Plus: get in touch with the company you booked your car with and ask them to stop doing business with Dickmanns. They try to rip customers off systematically and they should be out of business as soon as possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T14:12:36.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

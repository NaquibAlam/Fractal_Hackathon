First never received the Internet codes or key codes for the condo when I called them two weeks before leaving they said we never got a signed contract! Well they took all the money for rent but never bothered to call me to say they never received the contract. Well signed another and sent no problem. Get down here and the wifi code does not work call them up and he said he would get back to me. He never did I figured it out for myself. Lastly my condo is for sale they never disclosed that to me at time of renting I found myself online. Last but most important they would call and ask if I wanted to rent this same condo next year I said yes, assuming I was put on the calendar, but I keep getting the same call asking the same thing. So I did more research and found out they no longer have the contract to rent this after I leave this year. I would have paid them drove down next year only to find I did not have a place to stay (which I have found that a few people did in other condos thru vacation rental pros, came down only to find they could not stay in assigned condo) I was lucky enough to find out the rental company that took on this condo so God willing it does not get sold I have a contract for next year. If at all possible do not use this rental agency! However I know that have the most pet friendly units which is why I used them. I am working on others to open up to more pet friendly units.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T15:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:56:11.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

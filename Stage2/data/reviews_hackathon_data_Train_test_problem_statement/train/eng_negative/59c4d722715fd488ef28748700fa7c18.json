Which i have stayed at many many hotel including other Sheraton's, and the hold normally falls off a day later.\nNow i not going to trash the place because of an issue, but i going to just going to talk about my issue. Me and my wife stay there for two nights, we both are smokers and even at our own home we don't smoke inside of the house. We was falsely accused of smoking in the room, and the hold was not released from my card. We start calling to see why the hold was still there, we was told it will take an extra day because of the holiday. We call back a day later and was suppose to receive call back, okay so we called them back and this is when things got out of hand. We was told that we was smoking in the room and that they had pictures from there investigation. Now there investigation consisted of an empty cigarette pack in the trash and the candles and inscent that was left in the room. No butts no ashes from cigarettes. How ever i was told that they did not allow burning of candles at the hotel, but there is not a policy or rule to support this. SO I WOULD NOT STAY HERE EVER.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T13:11:34.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

So we did it again using my husbands credit card and the order went through without problem, and we almost instantly got an email for the order confirmation. about 2 days later we received 2 seperate shipping confirmations, on 2 seperate emails (one connected to each card). this puzzled us because the original order we tried came up error, and we didn't get an order confirmation at all, this is when I checked my statement and realized that prom girl charged EACH card the amount for the dress. I called prom girls customer service hoping that they weren't sending us 2 of the same dress, & was told they were. I understand that mistakes happen but what I don't understand is that They will not refund one of the cards until I pay out of my own pocket to ship the extra dress back to them!! the error was on their end and it was there fault and now they refuse to fix it until I pay to send back a dress that shouldn't have been shipped in the first place!! we received NO order confirmation anywhere but yet they still took the money from my account and sent us a duplicate of the dress. I don't mind sending it back but I would like to be reimbursed the extra $40 shipping cost!!! This is ridiculous. The dress came to just over $200 and we were charged twice and sent 2 even tho we only ordered one. We only received one order confirmation. This cannot be legal. very dissapointed with the way customer service treated me, do not buy from this company- they will make you jump through hoops if you don't end up happy with your purchase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:24:43.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

In effect, you achieve 1% loyalty bonus discount on each occasion you use the Company, e.g. 13 bookings equals 13% discount. Up until last year you were able to use this in conjunction with Promo codes available to anyone, e.g. Use HELLOFAN in the promo code box and you will receive 10% discount, no whoever they have stopped the ability to use both discounts, which effectively means that for 10 bookings Mallagacar treats you no better, and indeed less well, than someone who uses them for the first time and happens to use the HELLOFAN promo code. This, combined with their changes in insurance and breakdown cover which forces you to take the full pack rate unless you want to be hit with potential huge costs through a breakdown in the car, means that prices have escalated substantially in the last 2 years! Explanations welcome because I know I am not the only fan of Malagacar considering going elsewhere because of these changes!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:22:03.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

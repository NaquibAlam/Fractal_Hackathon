I wanted to get a tulip only arrangement that was featured on the Avis website. Their website even said if I ordered in the next 43 minutes they would waive the delivery charge. I got all the way to the point of paying, what I thought was the $64.99 tulip arrangement and although they waived the delivery fee they added a $13.48 Service fee. I called Avis and complained so they waived the Service Fee. I bought the arrangement in good faith that it would be similar to what I saw online. I was wrong. The friend I sent it to said it was full of greenery, spring flowers and 3 flower buds that had not opened. She didn't know it they were daffodils or tulips. I called Avis and they said it is in their policy that it can be a \"Designer arrangement\" instead of what you thought you saw online. I didn't read the fine print, so I lose but so do they because I won't buy from them again,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:02:58.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I signed and paid the tickets on the same day before midnight as the agent (Xavier) had asked me to do. On the following day, Xavier did not tell me that my tickets was not issued. Instead around 5 pm he told me that the tickets is not longer $696 but is now $798. All he could tell me is sorry and that he would cancel the ticket. I was furious because I already purchase the cruise ticket on that same morning. It is too late so I had to move forward to purchase the ticket and I had to speak to his manager Nicolas to get a discount rate for $762 but Nicolas told me I had to buy the protection insurance of $70 per person. I felt this was a nightmare since these guys did a switch and bait on me. As a customer, I wasn't told anything about any disclaimer or told on the phone or email that ticket can change at anytime. Now the ASAP ticket claims that they had told me that but only after I had gone to BBB about the issue. As a customer, I don't feel I am treat like a customer and that ASAP/ ITI is doing their best to work with me on my situation. Therefore, I will continue to take this matter forward because it matters to me that this company should have pay for my ticket on a timely matter so even when the prices do change up or down that as a broker working for me should honor their prices to their customer. Because of company has not gone above and beyond to help me with my issue I have to rate them poorly as a customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:01:06.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

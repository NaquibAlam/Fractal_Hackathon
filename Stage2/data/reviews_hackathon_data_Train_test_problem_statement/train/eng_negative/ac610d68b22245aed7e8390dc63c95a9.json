I was told the whole process would take 1-4 business days. My transfer took a whole 8 working days! This is really frustrating especially since my recipient needed that money but now unfortunately she couldn't pay what she was supposed to, thanks to transferwise. Frustrating because we had the money, but were unable to use it because it took 8 business days when we were told the whole process would take 1-4, I would've been more overbearing had it been with one day off, but whole 4 extra days!\nHad I known it would've taken so long I wouldn't have gone with them.\nIf you have a lot of time to spare concerning waiting time, then transferwise is all ok. But fast wasn't the case with me. I'm thoroughly disappointed in this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:28:19.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

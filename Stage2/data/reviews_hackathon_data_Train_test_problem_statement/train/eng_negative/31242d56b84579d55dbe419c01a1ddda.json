Determining the actual price, however, is sometimes a pain. They offer \"free shipping,\" but then supplement that with charges for insurance and handling! I work for a company that ships millions of dollars of products every year, and the insurance and handling are all part of the shipping costs - we do not separate the two. The reason we don't separate them is because it would annoy customers to do so. LensDirect doesn't mind annoying their customers.\nUPDATE: Based on LensDirect's reply to my review, \"The 2% processing fee on each order offsets a portion of the cost increases related to verification of prescriptions with your eye care provider, fuel surcharges on shipping, and return processing.\" By charging a percentage, they are implying that prescription verification, fuel surcharges, and return processing costs vary with price. So, if I buy four boxes of their cheapest contacts, it costs them less to verify my prescription than if I buy four boxes of their most expensive contacts. Or, the cheap contacts incur a lower fuel surcharge than the expensive contacts. Or, the cheap contacts cost less to process a return than the expensive contacts. Based on this ridiculous response, I have lowered my review by one star.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:19:09.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

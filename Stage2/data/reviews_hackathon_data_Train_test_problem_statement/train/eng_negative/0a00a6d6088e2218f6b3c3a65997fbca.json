I used a promo code for free shipping but ended up paying $5 for my order to be shipped in one business day. I have called a number of times for a tracking number and keep being told my order is in fulfillment. After one of the items in my order was canceled by the company I requested that my full order be canceled. I was told the order was in fulfillment and unable to be canceled. I was also told that I would received shipping notification later that day. I have yet to receive any shipping notification or tracking information. At this point, I will never order from this company again and couldn't in good conscious recommend them to anyone else.\nOrder #: 20-13670-2169326970", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:47:15.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

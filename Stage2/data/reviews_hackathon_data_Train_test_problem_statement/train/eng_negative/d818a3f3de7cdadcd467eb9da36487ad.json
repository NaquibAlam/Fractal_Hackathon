My problem was that my account was not verified for MONTHS, even though I was told it would take 1-2 days.\nSo after e-mailing a couple of times, and getting no response at all, my account suddenly became verified. It seems someone didn't do their job properly, and when I enquired about it, they realised this and quickly verified my account in a sneaky way, without actually contacting me or acknowledging my problem.\nThis is very concerning when I have thousands of dollars of my money in vaults. It makes absolutely no sense at all that I am able to deposit my money without being a verified user, but can't get it back without months of waiting and worrying. For this alone, gold money should be waiving fees attached to withdrawal of my money. Having to pay to get my money back (as well as deposit it!) is a joke. You guys did the wrong thing, were not contactable, and are essentially ignoring my e-mails to this day.\nSo when I( finally became able to get my money from goldmoney vaults, I made a mistake in the withdrawal amount, and after contacting support once again via e-mail (they don't even have a contact number) to try to fix the problem, I was ignored.\nFor me this meant that I wasn't able to withdraw all of my my money from goldmoney. I wanted to cancel the transfer and try again, but of course there will be a $25aus fee attached to that, too, even though it doesn't cost goldmoeny anything to get done.\nI was not able to cancel my withdrawal at all, and did not even receive a response to my e-mail about the mater. Which means I can't withdraw the last $100 dollars of my money wihtout paying yet another fee, and depositing more money for a fee, in order to exceed the minimum withdrawal amount.\nThis is an absolute joke, and I would never recommend goldmoney to anyone. My fees should be waived, and my money should have been returned to me MONTHS before it was. I also should have been contaced by customer support via e-mail or phone. I really needed this money months ago as I was desperate to make a few payments with it. I was not able to get my money, and it really costed me.\nVery sneaky business going on here. They suck you in, and then you will be stuck without access to your own money, and no way to contact help. Do not use goldmoney.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T18:18:41.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

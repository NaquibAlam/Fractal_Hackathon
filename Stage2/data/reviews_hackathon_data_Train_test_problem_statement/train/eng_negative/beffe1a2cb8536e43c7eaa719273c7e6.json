I have never experienced any banks can lie and can be rude like Noris bank.\nTheir advertisement tells people how we can get a bank card to withdraw our money outside of Germany without fee. I checked their offer and details first and I saw that they stated they used Mastercard currency exchange rate to guaruntee the rate.\nI applied. When I withdrew outside of Germany, the rate was horrible and took advantage of me a lot. I checked and compared its rate with Mastercard exchange rate. It was not even close. When I called to ask them, they said it's their bank and their policy, they can Quote: how much rate they want. Seriously??? This is considered stealing ! The guy on the phone was not even polite.\nThey also took advantage of me with using their credit card on website. I bought stuff from the store that located in Germany. Noris charged me additionally for international fee. When I contacted them quickly and provided related prove via email. They gave me very hard time by telling me that they accepted only mail (paper mail, letter and everything from 1970)\nGathering info for the police now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T07:50:20.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was first changed then cancelled, then they spent 3 weeks trying to find an alternative.\nWhen I called them I received 3 completely contradictory responses as I kept ringing to avoid confusion:\nCustomer service member1: Said I could have a refund for the flight from Manchester to Paris and book alternative means of getting to Paris so that the rest of my flight is intact.\nCustomer service member2: Said my whole booking would have to be cancelled and refunded.\nCustomer service member3: Said I had a time change on one of my flights and needed to say whether I accept it or not.\nI eventually was offered a full refund to which I replied:\nDear Customer 'Care',\nI fully accept this refund of £586.10 GDP and I can confirm that I will not book with your company again as a result of the poor service and the stress and inconvenience that you have caused. I EXPECT THIS REFUND TO HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY unlike the slow service you have provided so far. I am utterly disgusted after the disaster with this booking that you have not at the very least offered me a refund that totals the amount of my original payment £603. If not some kind of compensation for your poor service.\nYour customer service has been poor, inaccurate, confusing, contradictory and has left us worried about a trip that we have spent two years planning, working for and looking forward to.\nThe current flight prices for the same trip are an extra £200 above what we originally paid as we originally booked in January to avoid inflated prices.\nThis leaves us in a situation with no flight, and way more money to pay.\nYou have spent the last 3 weeks or more very slowly contacting airlines etc in order to rectify this which is too slow for such a huge amount of money and the lack of urgency has left us feeling that your company is entirely unprofessional and you certainly do not care.\nI plan on sharing this information on as many online platforms as possible in order to let other people know what kind of terrible company you are and how you treat your customers. I hope this results in a lack of custom and people will no longer be scammed by your 'low' prices for non-existent flights.\nI expect my money to be returned to my account immediately or I will seek further action against your company.\nPlease forward this to your highest management and complaints department.\nCompletely disgusted and disappointed,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:35:50.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

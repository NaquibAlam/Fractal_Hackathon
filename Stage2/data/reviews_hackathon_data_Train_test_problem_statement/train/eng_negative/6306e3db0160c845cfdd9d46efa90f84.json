They were expected to come in on the 24th, when I received a call on the 23rd from them saying that the Neoprene is \"out of stock\", and to look at the photo she sent me. The photo was clearly done one cheap foam, and she was trying to pass it off as a nicer quality product. When I brought that up, along with the defects on some of the lettering, she changed her story to that the imprint wouldn't stick to the neoprene, not that they were out.. and that I would have to change the design to only have 1 color. When i spoke with a supervisor, she tried saying production mispoke, and refused to help us out. When you spend $400 on koozies for your wedding you want them to be quality, and not something you can pick up at the bar. The supervisor refused to help us, and would not let us use 2 colors, and that we had to stick to one. Customer service definitely lacks with this company.

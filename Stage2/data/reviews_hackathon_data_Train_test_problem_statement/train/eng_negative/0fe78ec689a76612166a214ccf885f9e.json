However, after selecting 3 flights (multiple city vacation), i filled out all my info, and went to confirm booking, the price jumped $9000...what? so i thought perhaps one of my flights booked up in that time it took me to fill out the form, or some other eroneous error occurred. I redid everything again, and still the same price jump. I decided it would be good to call customer service to see what was wrong. The operator was friendly and nice, but couldn't answer why there was a price jump online, and then could not find the same flights through his system for the same price, he found something similar, but one of the flights had a stop over which i said i did not want, and the cost of the flights were still higher than what was originally Quote: d on the website. He sort of tried to rush me to book, and i had to explain a few times that no, that's not what i want, and that i would just go book through another site. I thought i would give one last chance to try and book by myself through flighthub. It finally worked. But i feel there was a lot of wasted time and it was quite a painful process. I was close to booking through another website, but it was only due to them having a slightly better price that i tried one last time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:57:17.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

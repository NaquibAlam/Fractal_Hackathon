I signed up for the weekly rate for \"Premium Membership\" about a week ago and really have not seen nor experienced much added value from this service. I have not received any job alerts based on my profile (like most other job boards-most of which are free) and no responses from the multitude of applications I submitted. So when I went into the site to downgrade today (8 days later) I am shocked to find out that they renewed me for another month, rather than just for another week like I was lead to believe. This is VERY MISLEADING, so please beware. There is no phone support, which is a bit concerning to begin with. So the only way to try to resolve this problem is through a generic support email address. I am not optimistic and may have to file a dispute through my credit card. Proceed with caution\nI did receive a response the same day following my initial review above. They indicated that they would provide a courtesy refund based on the misunderstanding of their policy. I have since verified that the refund was posted back into my account.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:20:15.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

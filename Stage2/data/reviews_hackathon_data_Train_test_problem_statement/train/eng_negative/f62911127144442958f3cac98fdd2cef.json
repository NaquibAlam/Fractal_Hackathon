They burned my face with 2nd degree burns in my face. You were more than anxious to communicate with me to sell, in fact my friend said you called her the other morning at 8 am, but refused to answer any of my calls after I presented this problem to you. As soon as I mentioned my problem you disconnect and will not return my calls. You state that you are North America Sales Manager. this is the type of problem that should be handled immediately. Your company Preimer dead sea USA offers a 30 day money back guarantee but you have not supplied me with a return label or even returned a phone call. Inna I am returning the product to the address on the shipping label, your company should pay for the return shipping. If I do not hear back from you by 3/14/17 - I will have no other options and I will start filing complaints with Consumer Affairs, Health dept., federal Trade Commission, all Attorney Generals Office and BBB.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T11:37:25.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

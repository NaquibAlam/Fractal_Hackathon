We booked our tickets months before. When checking in at the Airport, we were told that unfortunately we were not seated together..\nFour rows with 11 and 13 rows between each stats. My 8 and 12 year old boys were sad and scared. We Are from Danmark, so they speak very little English and no German. At the way to USA the 8 year old was flightsick and was trowing up, who should manage this? The French lady next to him????\nAt the checkin desk and at the gate we met no understanding. At the flight we met a nice flightattendand, who helped us and other families with same problem. She arranged so we sat two and two..\nWhy does this problem accure? It is not nice for your personel, who have the challenges at the flight, to find the solutions.\nYou can see it is a family with children travelling together before seating the flights.\nWho should explain and translate the safety onboard procedures for the children, when they are left by themselves by Lufthansa.\nIt was the same problem for another family, when we were travelling with our next Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Copenhagen. They were split up and one of the children weekend crying, so the were calling the father at the speaker.\nLuckely we were with SAS at the way to USA.\nSanne / Denmark", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T08:55:55.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

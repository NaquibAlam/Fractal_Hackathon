A driver can be scanned in to my building from my phone when they arrive, and there is video surveillance on site - so there is little reason to believe the package is unsafe in this location.\nThe package is then sent across town to a reception centre full of other annoyed customers and (apparently) undervalued staff.\nI would almost prefer the driver take a swing at throwing the parcel up onto my balcony as opposed to dealing with Purolators central warehousing.\nA contact attempt has been placed to attempt to \"permanently provide approval\" for drop off at my flat, if this is possible then I wont consider Purolator any more insidious than the other big courier companies.

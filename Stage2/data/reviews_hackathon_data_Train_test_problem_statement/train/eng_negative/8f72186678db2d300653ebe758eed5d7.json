I let him know that if he could not match the price, that I was cancelling my order. He did not cancel the order, and the tracking number provided was not correct and never showed shipped. I didn't know if the order was cancelled or not, so I placed another order with the other website. I emailed again to make sure the order was cancelled. He said it had shipped and that it could not be cancelled. He then provided another tracking number after the shipment arrived, and said the shipment would need to be returned if I didn't want it. If you do not guarantee the lowest price, you should remove that from your website.

They sent me only 1. Online in the pics it looked like what my husband needed. From the pics i thought it was the same wires we had on our car thats melted but when we got it, it was just too big and not what we were looking for. I emailed customer service after I recieved the package and there was only 1. I also told them I wanted to return the 1 because it's not what I needed. So i had to send them a picture of what i was sending back. Then USPS Priority with a Tracking # sent back to them and email them with Tracking #. A week later I only got a partial refund! They refunded me for the only 1 I returned. As I said in my first email to customer service I only recieved a half order. Now here I am out $30 for a item I never recieved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T15:33:09.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

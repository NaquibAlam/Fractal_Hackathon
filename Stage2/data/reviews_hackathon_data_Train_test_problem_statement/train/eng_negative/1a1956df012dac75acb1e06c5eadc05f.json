The old app had a better layout than the new one. Not than any have worked completely.\nI have just redeemed physical gold and silver and on the transaction you are charged £45 for delivery on each transaction and 0.5 grams of gold from account.\nI was then charged by ups at my door at 9.30 am without any notification? receipt or invoice? Or any explanation £108.44p. I then call ups who had to investigate. Apparently its the shipping company they use from the united states called d g w in dallas, but I paid for gold and silver from my uk vault? So that is obviously just a pricing myth. I will not be using gold money or be an affiliate until they rectify this mistake and refund my money. But doubt that as I would be relunctant to receive a response from the non existent customer service. They only hold your money why should they contact your promptly. Also depositing can also be a tedious wait. Once again its only your money. I ordered gold and silver just to see how the system works and to be honest i do not have much confidence in bitgold (GoldMoney). Your better off ordering your own physical silver and gold. Or use app for rate of cash then when it goes up withdraw and buy physical or bitcoins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T16:52:15.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was looking for hotels in Rome for my mother in law who is disabled - I reserved a few different ones, as I've also done. My bank rang us to say that all our money had been take out of our account and left us with nothing. I was baffled by this as this has never happened before. Booking.com say that's its a preauthorisation from the hotel and no money is charged to that card. I beg to differ booking.com cause you've left us with no money to live. Don't believe what they tell you. They are saying it's going to take 5 working days for the money to go back in!!!! My husband is going away before then and has no money to go with!! It shouldn't have been taken in the first place. Will use Expedia from now on. MISLEADING UNTRUSTWORTHY service from booking.com will not use this service ever again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:28:01.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

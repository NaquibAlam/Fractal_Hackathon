It is almost as if they expect it because the drivers are so quick to suggest delivering another one or return and get your money back. I know that's what they are supposed to do but after awhile it just loses its appeal. I can basically have it delivered one day a week because of my work schedule so if its not right then it becomes a major inconvenience. With the just purchased $2k washer & dryer I caught the problems after they hooked things up so was w/o for a week until they delivered new ones. Just bought a bedroom dresser and did not slide every drawer in and out and you guessed it...one drawer doesn't stay on the slide...I guess that wouldn't have been important to check before it was put on the truck....yes I'll just fix it myself", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:37:12.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

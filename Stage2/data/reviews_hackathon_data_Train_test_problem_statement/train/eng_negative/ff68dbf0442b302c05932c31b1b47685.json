The car was due its mot the same day. However we couldn't find the locking wheel nut. We rang the number to be told \"we'll sort it \" the guy who came turned up 2 hours early which was great. He spent about 2 minutes trying to get the locking wheel nuts off. He told me he couldn't do it but we still got charged £25 call out fee. Not bad for 2 minutes work!\nWe have since taken it to a garage who got all 4 locking nuts off, fit a new tyre and replaced the locking nuts all for £60.\nMy business will be going elsewhere in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:46:19.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

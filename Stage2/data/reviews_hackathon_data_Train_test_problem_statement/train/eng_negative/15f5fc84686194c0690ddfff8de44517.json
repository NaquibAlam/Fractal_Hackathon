I paid $999.00 for:\nWeb Custom Package:\n$999.00\n100% Satisfaction Guaranteed\n100% Money back\nI have only received a logo that only cost $200.00. I purchased this package from Lisa Patrick on 7/1/2016. Lisa was nice up until I made the payment and then she vanished only to pop back up when she felt her job was in jepordy.Aftyer about 15 gruling days I recived my logo and my stock business card template. The next step was the website. I then sent Pixels everything that they requestd to get strted and this is where the nightmare begun.After hundreds of emails,soeaking with over 10 different mangers I have yet to recive my Website. I had to spend an additional $775.00 which another Company that designed my now opertable website.\nI experienced hell with Pixels. I called everyday,allday only to be hung up on, lied to and promised that I will receive something in regards to the look and design of the site. On numerous occasions, I asked for them to refund my money but I have only received a “the money has been refunded” reply which is not true. This Company(Pixelslogodesign.com) is literally taking consumers money and in exchange giving them absolutely nothing in return. I am 9 months pregnant and I have been hospitalized twice dealing with this stressful situation. Just recently I was suppose to speak with a Supervisor by the name of Jason W. to no avail . I believe that Lisa P. the women who swiped my card for the initial $999.99 is the ring leader. Her role I believe is to trick consumers into believing that they are based in the U.S. .Lisa speaks perfect English and assures you that your project will run smoothly and efficiently because she will be there every step of the way.\nPlease see the attached:\n1. Receipt for $999.00 purchase made on 7/1/2016\n2. Screen shot of Pixels Logo Design stating that they have refunded back the charge.\nPlease note that I have over 100 email exchanges. I also have proof that the money was never refunded back into my account.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T10:13:32.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The ordering process was easy..we paid $100 in shipping which I guess for the weight of everything it was decent. In total we paid about $480 or so. It took about 4 days for the frame, the speed bag and the double end rope to arrive..no heavy bag. I called them they said it was being delivered separately..I said ok. We inflated the speed bag and tried it out..within an hour it was deflated. We tried putting air in it again and can hear the air coming out of it..it was defected. Called then and they asked me for a picture and said they are re sending another one..another 3 or 4 days for delivery..the next day the heavy bag arrived...but we can't hang it because there was no hook to hang it with.. I contacted them and they said they would try and send the hook with the speed bag..later that night I got a message that the hook would be sent separately too..wth..All in all it's been a bad experience..I will not be ordering anything from this place again..honestly I think I should get a small refund back for this experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T20:00:35.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I had selected someone to do my job and we were then organising a time for pick up and delivery we had confirmed the time, I sent through all of the details confirming again and I then got a cancellation through Airtasker at 5.25am when the task was to be completed at 7am. My push notifications only sometimes work so I didn't receive the notification and I received no further contact from the guy. I messaged and called him to see where he was and he had blocked my number. I know this isn't Airtaskers fault but i feel they could have done more. It is also frustrating that I can't review him because he did not complete my job. Airtasker need to push any cancellations through as a message. I then had to get someone else to do the job (which actually went to plan) and received a text to confirm the job had been done to release the funds. How is it you can inform me by message when you want to pay someone but you can't inform me by message when someone is cancelling my job 1.5 hours before it's due to be picked up? I feel this needs to be reviewed. As mentioned however the second guy I got was great however im still cautious to use Airtasker now if I ever need something done on a certain date considering they can cancel with no notice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:28:15.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

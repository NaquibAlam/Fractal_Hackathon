He offered me either a $10 savings or a increase in my internet speed. I choose the savings and also mentioned that I would like to save even more by returning 2 of my 4 boxes. He said that would not be a problem. The plan that I have consist of a Multi room DVR and 3 set top boxes which I was able to record and watch the shows on all the boxes. As soon as i arrived home my Multi room DVR service was removed from the set top boxes and I can only view my recordings on one box.\nI called customer service to see why did this happen and requested that my service be restored. I was informed that they no longer support the Multi room service and now i\"m forced to upgrade to the Quantum box at a higher price. No one can explain why my service interrupted in the first place, . That one phone call that was suppose to be saving me money, ended up with paying more money for less services. I've been with Verizon over six years and to come to this is unacceptable. Spectrum guess you will be my new Cable provider.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T11:11:02.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The game has been cancelled and is being rescheduled for an undetermined date. I'm from Canada and visiting London on vacation for the purpose of going to this game. They refuse to give me a refund and there is no phone number to contact them and the online contact the people aren't even English?. Horrible and an absolute scam. Sent 3 emails with no response. I just want my money back, and they say the seller doesn't get the funds until I get the tickets -- which I haven't so they're shouldn't be an issue. And they say the game hasn't been changed but it has. They advanced in the FA cup so the game is not on the same date anymore. You can check the website. Zero customer service, keep telling me to re-sell the tickets I purchased since they won't issue a refund yet they make it so I can't even re-sell them on the site! Tell me to send in a form and I've sent 4 with no reply and the live agents are a joke and don't help.\nBUYERS AND SELLERS BEWARE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T23:12:12.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

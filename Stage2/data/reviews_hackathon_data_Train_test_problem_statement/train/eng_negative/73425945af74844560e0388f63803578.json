There are hidden exclusions not clearly mentioned.\nThis year I decided I would change by usual tax prep services, and opted for RG Brenner based on it's promotions found when visiting their website.\nWhen I walked in, and showed the promotion, I was told \"It only applies to 3 tax prep services\". Yet, referencing the image, this is not stated anywhere on the coupon.\nBeware of this company , and their underhanded business practices.\nAfter writing this review, I received the following message from the management of the company:\n\"(name removed)\nManagement appraised me of your claim that we did not honor the 50% switch& save promotion. (name removed) stated that even after he showed you the clearly marked terms of the promotions (and the fact that you did not even qualify for the promotion in question) we still honored it. The min. fee for that promotion is $99 which is what you were charged and what you paid. However, even after we honored a promotion you did not qualify for that wasn’t good enough for you. In no uncertain terms, you threatened that if we did not refund you money, you would leave negative reviews. And you have followed through on your threats.\nTo put it simply, R&G Brenner we will not be blackmailed, sir—regardless the amount of money. So leave as many the fake reviews on as many sites as you’d like. We’ll meticulously have them and/or you removed from those sites once you are exposed as the liar you are. We stand behind our products and our services. We know that we will receive many more positive reviews from our thousands of other clients rendering your destructive attempts moot.\n(name removed), we service 30,000+ clients a year. I respect and value all of them..until now: you are a shining example of the type of client we do not want to have anything to do with; dishonest, unreasonable, vindictive & purposefully damaging.\nIn conclusion, we are confident in our services of which you no longer qualify for you. Your reviews will eventually be buried or erased…but the fact that you are a pathetic, low-life, scumbag? Well, I am happy to say: that can never be buried or erased.\" -Management", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T06:33:23.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

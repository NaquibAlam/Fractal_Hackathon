The colors are great. The packaging appeared okay upon arrival; however the wig looks used. There are many patches of unbraided roots in the lace wig, including 40% of the edges. Also, the ends of the wig are left unbraided.\nThis was my FIRST online hair purchase. I usually go to the beauty store to see and assess the product prior to purchase. Due to the ombre color I was looking for which is rarely found in the store, I resulted to ordering online.\nI have recently bought another similar style lace wig from a beauty supply store that was in excellent, new condition. It was from the same Zuri beauty line.\nI hope to return this purchase and receive a FULL refund. This wig appears as it must have been the try-on wig that got packaged and shipped out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T15:46:50.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

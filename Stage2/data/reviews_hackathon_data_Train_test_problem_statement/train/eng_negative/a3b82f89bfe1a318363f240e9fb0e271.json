I was always worried whether he would show up. I was only eassurrd once that he would. I am sure he would off but this company has no idea how stressful it is for their clients. I was lead through the process was given very little actual advice. Once when I asked a helping lawyer what their experience was I was told to mind my own business thats after giving them over 80 000. When I meet with my lawyer he often wasnt up to date with what I had sent so I stopped attending. On fridays when they sent everything out to you often with no suggestions you rarely get hold of anyone if u rang them and you and are left all weekend with it. They did give me the best barrister and when I said this to them they immediately talked about someone they just lost because of that barrister. I would no longer suggest them to anyone for family law. I would for wills they were great for that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:27:08.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The representative said that this was a mistake by momondo. However, this is not true as the flight was booked through the flightnetwork website. He reassured me that I would need to pay another $400 to book that flight as this was the best available. THis is very unprofessional and left me $1,700 short for a week, which is the snail pace that it took them to refund my money.\nNever again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T01:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:42:44.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was first told that it would take one to two days to unlock my phone. I was emailed a confirmation telling me that the \"Unlock Device App\" on my phone had received an code and was ready to unlock. But everytime I tried to unlock it, I still get the message, \"Unlocked Failed blah blah.\" I have already tried the chat feature and submitted two service tickets and have gotten no response. I even called the telephone number listed in the \"Contact Us\" area of their webpage and was not able to speak to anyone. I've been emailing back and forth and I am being given erroneous information. One minute they are telling me that they have unlocked the \"Unlock Device App\" on my phone with instructions via email on how to unlock it. I followed the directions and STILL NO UNLOCK! I notified them and the next minute they are telling me that I have to wait another 5 days for my phone to be unlocked. I have paid $33.95 for a premium unlock that I never got. I am very frustrated and I want a COMPLETE REFUND.

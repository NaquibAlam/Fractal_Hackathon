They will withdraw your money first and then hold your money saying they need this and that. If you know you can't process the transaction, then why withdraw the money?\nThen if you don't agree with them, they will hold the money for another 5-7 days before the money is transferred back. I get money transferred from via ACH in 2 days from other banks. So the technology and means do exist.\nAnd if you ever have to talk to Customer Care, they are RUDE and talk as if they are doing you a favor. They talk as if they are collection agents and not customer service agents!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T20:05:25.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

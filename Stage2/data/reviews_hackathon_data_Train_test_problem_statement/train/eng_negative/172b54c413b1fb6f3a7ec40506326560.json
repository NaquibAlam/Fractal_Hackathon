Contacted their after sale support in hope they will send me tray and all OK, but I was very unpleasantly suprised. Their after sales support was so slow and did not offer any good solution, so I had to open Paypal dispute.\nAfter I opened Paypal dispute, they claim that they have part but will not send me until I close that dispute.\nOf course I am not crazy to close dispute before I have completly working phone.\nI want to warn all potential customers of this, becouse only fraud company would demand dispute clousre. Honest company would send that tray ASAP and gave apology to customer.\nDO NOT BUY ON TINYDEAL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:24:29.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

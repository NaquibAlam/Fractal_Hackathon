Then I called Bravofly and told them about this problem, so they said they will check, and a few day later there was one email sent to me that the flight was canceled from airline, so I call them to cancel this booking and get me my money back.\nAnd I ready told Bravofly what I want, and they said please wait a few day and I will answer you by email. But a few day passed, there was no any answer back. Then I ask them by email they said becaus you answer late so you cannot get the refund amount which you want!!! I ready answer by call. And they said now airline'flight is alive, so it will be as before.Omg after the email informed me that flight was canceled by airline.and after I answer that I want refund>>I ready bought another ticket ready.\nBut it cannot do anything and I am tried to talk with Bravofly so I said just return the refund to me , they said it will take 10days. So I said it's okay. But after 10days but no any refund back then I sent email and asked about progress. And the reply email is the take some days. Then I think it will be okay and it will be the lesson and next time I will not book any booking with Bravofly. But it is not the end.today one email sent to me that the the refund will be 477euros(before was 1,652$) and have answer today\nToo ba agent,please do not book any booking with them", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T22:49:06.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

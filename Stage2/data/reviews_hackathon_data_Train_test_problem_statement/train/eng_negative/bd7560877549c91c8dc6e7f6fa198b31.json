No exchange or purchase can compare with my dealings with 4seating.com. It has been the worst consumer experience I have ever had to endure! If I said they had proven incompetent I would be giving them credit they don't deserve.\nI ordered my chairs December 19th. The order was to ship December 22nd, I was given the impression I would receive them the first week of the new year. I waited until the second week to inquire about them, they showed delivered to the \"white glove,\" service, but no one had contacted me. When I checked with 4seating they tried to determine what was going on, they gave me the number to the white glove service and I contacted them directly. They said they couldn't schedule the delivery until the order was complete; all parts delivered to them. Apparently they only received two of the eight chairs I had ordered. After perhaps a dozen phone calls it was determined our lost chairs had shipped to Pompano Beach Florida. According to 4seating it seemed the shipper, \" who made the error,\" did not feel compelled to rectify their mistake by rushing to get the lost chairs to us. 4seating compensated us for the inconvenience by putting $200 back on our credit card. They also shipped out complimentary holders for our chairs, because they, \"felt so bad.\" Unfortunately 4 seating shipped those to the wrong address. (Those have still not been delivered.) The chairs finally arrived and were \"white glove,\" deliver today (January 28th 2017). My wife and I joked the order couldn't be fowled up any worse, but to our chagrin it was. One of the chairs was missing the electric recliner motor. I called 4 seating and was on hold 27 minutes and 36 seconds before I was disconnected. I called back and used the extension for purchases, thinking that wait wouldn't be as long. I spoke with Clarisa who informed me no manager or supervisor was available today, they were off, and that they would call me tomorrow. They didn't call, in fact no supervisor was on duty today.\nIt should be noted I am a proactive consumer I am not sure how long this ordeal would have lasted had I not been making the effort to call them and follow up on our order. I counted the emails, and phone calls I have made thus far and it comes out to:\n25 emails\n52 phone calls to 4Seating.com, and\n15 to the local White glove delivery service.\nThese are the ones I can find on my phone with their common numbers, I am sure there are more, to different extensions.\nThe only redeeming thing I can say is Rebecca, the assistant who tried to rectify this mess, was abundantly apologetic, sympathetic, and genuinely seemed to care. I don't know if she was ham-strung by corporate incompetence, or that we happen to be the very unlucky consumer that have had everything go wrong.\nUpdate:\nI spoke with Fernando this afternoon. Despite being told a manager would call it never happened, there was no manager on duty today. After speaking with Fernando i was able to assemble the chairs in the proper configuration thanks to his patient and understanding instructions. In addition he was able to order a motor and have it shipped to my home. He advised me to call him as soon as it arrives and he would dispatch a technician to install the motor. The chairs seem nice, but the consumer experience with the exception of Fernando and Rebecca was abysmal.

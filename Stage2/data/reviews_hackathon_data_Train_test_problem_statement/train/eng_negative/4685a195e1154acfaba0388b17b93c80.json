The service was excellent until time to check out. We were there for nearly 3 hours and there was couple there that arrived after us and they had an issue and everyone that was helping me just stopped doing so. We finally got our order put in and left. A week later when our furniture is suppose to be in I called homezone on Tuesday to check I was told it wasn't in but another truck was coming the next day and to try back then. I received a called Wednesday telling me the that a table they do not sell anymore was ordered instead of the one I chose. So now I have to wait another week for a kitchen set that I really need. I wouldn't have mind the wait if I was kept engaged and reassured that things were happening, but instead it feels like I lost 2 hours so they could talk to friends that came in or help others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:46:02.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The company so far is making it very difficult for us to contact them as they keep closing our tickets. This is their mistake but I am having to do all the work here without any help from them, plus they still have my money for something that I did not order and does not fit!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T03:43:43.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After three days with nothing but a receipt, I emailed to ask when they would be shipped, as each day was getting colder. They told me \"mid-December at the earliest\" which was cutting it pretty close for me here on the North Shore of Massachusetts. The trees did not ship. One day in early March I received a notice from FedEx that a package from Willis Orchards will be delivered in a few days. They did not reach out before hand to ask whether it made sense to send 10 trees to the frozen tundra that is Massachusetts in early March. So I had 10 trees arrive. Luckily, the snow from the previous storm had melted and the ground softened up just enough for me to get them planted just before Superstorm Stella dumped another foot of snow on us. I have no idea whether the trees will survive. I can barely see them under the snow piles at the moment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:27:08.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

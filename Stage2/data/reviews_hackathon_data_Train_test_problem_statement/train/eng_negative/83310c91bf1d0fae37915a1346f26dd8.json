Initial purchase was for a pair of trainers from their UK domain, with a UK customer service number (which I now know diverts to Germany). Paid £3.95 to have the goods shipped. Had to return them and was Quote: d £17.95 as the most cost effective way to return the trainers in their original packaging (using RoyalMail). I asked to be refunded this cost, to which they flatly refused. I was faced with no choice but to return them. It took them 10 days, whilst I chased for them as to whether they had received them, until they acknowledged receipt and processed my refund. I have since made a formal complaint and have had no response from their customer service email team despite chasing 3 times.\nI feel it is grossly unfair for them to proclaim to be a co.uk company with a UK Customer Telephone number and charge only £3.95 for shipping. Then make it prohibitively expensive to return any goods that are incorrect.\nVery poor operation in this day and age.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T23:07:47.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

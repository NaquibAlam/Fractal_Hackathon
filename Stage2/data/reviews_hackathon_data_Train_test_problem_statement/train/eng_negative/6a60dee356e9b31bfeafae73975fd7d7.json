These people are the absolute worst company that makes clothing. Ordered a pair of yoga pants for my wife, 2 weeks later I got the pants with a hole in the knee. Obviously they did not care to check. I called so they could send me another pair and rush order them (for her birthday, thought I gave them plenty of time not to screw this one up). Wanted me to pay for it! Are you kidding me?! It would take 3 weeks for them to get the new pair to me.\nNext, some of my friends know how big of giants fan I am so they got me a customized T-shirt with the NY on the front and last name and number on the back. First t-shirt they gave me everything was crooked on it! The front NY and the last name on the back, obviously they did not look twice. They did let us keep that shirt while they sent another. Just got it the other day, guess what the front NY looks fine but the back number and name is damn crooked. What in the world are you guys doing?! Poor quality and customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:47:49.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

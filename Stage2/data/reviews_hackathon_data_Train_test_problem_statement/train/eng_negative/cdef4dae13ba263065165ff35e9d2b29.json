It appears on all video games, especially on sports games – you can always see a ghost shadow behind each running athlete on a green lawn. It’s a hardware defect, and you have no way to fix it through configuration. I have another cheap monitor (under $60). But its gaming experience is much better than this one -- and you call it a \"gaming monitor\"!\nI called the BenQ customer service, waited for 70+ minutes, and nobody answered it. On their menu they don’t even have a basic sorting, like tech support or bill service, individual or business customers. It's ALL IN ONE! Honestly this is the most inefficient and unfriendly customer service I've ever seen.

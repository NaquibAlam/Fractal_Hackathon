However, I was quite displeased that nearly 2 weeks had gone by and my order was not processed. I was proactive in e-mailing my prescription with order number attached, immediately after placing my order. Less than an hour later I received a message, that appeared to be automated, requesting the prescription that was already sent. I assumed that the email hadn't been checked. This was frustrating because of the delay and the order still would not have been processed if I had not uploaded it online.\nI am updating my review because I cannot reply to the response from opticontacts. Their response was definitely not personalized and my complaint obviously wasn't read. I emailed the prescription, but it was never uploaded by opticontacts. I've uploaded the prescription yet my order still isn't processed. The lack of incompetence is frustrating. If you have a system with multiple means of receiving prescriptions, why isn't the order processed. Why didn't the customer service rep replying to the response not respond with comprehension or resolution? The response I should have received was, \" we are truly sorry for the delay in processing your order. howeve,r it has been processed and shipping will be expedited. I was able to retrieve the email that you sent referencing the order number and I was also able to retrieve the prescription that you uploaded online and I'm truly sorry that you are displeased and it has taken so long.\" Im definitely going to send it again, considering the contacts are paid for and I can't get reimbursed without receipt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:27:27.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

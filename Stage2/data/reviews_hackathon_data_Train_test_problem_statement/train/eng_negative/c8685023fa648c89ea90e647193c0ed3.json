Everytime I tried to book my flight they cancelled it saying it was no longer available. I would search for a new flight and the old one would still show up saying it has 7 tickets available. This happened 4 times. Finally I called them and the customer service agent didn't even speak enough English to help me. I went through 3 before someone finally told me that flight \"should be taken down\"... Though listed multiple times in the same search window and repeat searches. I asked what they can do to help and they said to not book through them! As I was talking to them I saw a flight with a different airline which actually let me book it, then they charged me the wrong amount. When I called customer service back she said that the price changed from when I confirmed to when payment was accepted. This was less than 1 min and I didn't confirm the price I was charged. She told me there was nothing they can do. Never again. With so many other booking companies out there, use a different one!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:49:53.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

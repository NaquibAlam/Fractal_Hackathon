I am not going in detail to much, because you are not here to read novels, but I have rented my server there for about a month now, which of i could use my server for about 1,5 weeks. That means that 75% of the time, the servers went down (speaking of the france once, affecting europe)\nThe staff does absolutely NO efford to help the community with any usefull information, if you ask them a question, they either don't know the answer, or give a pre packaged answer.\nServers in france have been down for a week now, and the GG staff has no clue why and are not even caring.\nTL:DR Do NOT buy your server at GGservers.com if you want to play on a hosted server anytime you want. If you consider buying your server here, expect atleast 50% DOWNTIME.\nHope this helps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:40:02.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

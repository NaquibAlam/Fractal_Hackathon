However, I sent an email just TWO days late to request a return, and was completely turned down because I'd passed the 7-day return deadline. I had no idea that 2 days would be such a huge violation; the time allowed to judge a painting you've never seen in real before receiving is too short- especially considering the four-figure prices of most works. My opinion is they purposely restrict it in order to give themselves advantage over the buyer - not exactly equitable when dealing in items as subjective as art!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T21:00:53.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

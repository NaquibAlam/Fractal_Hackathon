There were multiple problems after with locking brake, warning messages on my dash and the vehicle being locked in 4WD high. The dealership said that the problems could not be fixed, especially computer issues, without bringing it into the shop. The shop had it for two day and locked out the intoxalok which took 2 hours out of my day to have reset. Problems have still not been corrected with vehicle that has to be taken in for possibly two more days, that probably will involve another reset on restricted driving times. I did not receive any manual or instructions to report when I am taking my vehicle in for maintenance. If you don't ask every question, whether you know it or not, you could get yourself in hot water.\nIt has been two weeks. I have had my vehicle into the dealer trying to determine what the problem is (they are not allowed to use the device to start the vehicle based on policy, which would mean I would have to sit there all day), the installer--whom I paid cash for the installation--has been unavailable or has not returned my calls and the intoxalock contact through this has been away for most of the issues. Still continues to be a challenge with wires now visible under my dash that were not their before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T23:17:27.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

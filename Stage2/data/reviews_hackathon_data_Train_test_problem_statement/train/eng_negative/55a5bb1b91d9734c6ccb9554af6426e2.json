But the actual lamp received only measure 48 cm, this is a major quality problem and I simply cannot use the lamp. So I requested the return of the item.\nMajor problems are:\n1) Lightinthebox is not willing to reimburse me for the return shipping costs, this is approx. 65 EUR. Meaning the cost to return the item from Denmark to their warehouse in Poland.\n2) Lightinthebox is not willing to reimburse me for the original shipping cost from China to Denmark, that was approx. 65 EUR.\n3) The service center takes 4-5 days to respond to my claims (via their ticket system). Even though they promise a fast response of less than 24 hrs, my experience has been 120 hrs.\nTicket ID: 14838223\nOrder Number: 1701160821185036\nAt the moment, Lightinthebox only offers to reimburse the cost of the lamp itself, but at the end if I pay all shipment costs, this is a major loss for me. They are not taking the responsibility of their poor product quality, and are making their customers loose money and time.\nI am still requesting them to pay for the shipping costs. If they decide to take responsibility and pay for the consequences, I will let you know uodating my review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T14:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:50:49.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

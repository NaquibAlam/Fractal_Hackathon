Upon receiving the iPad Mini, I discovered it would not meet my professional needs. The iPad Mini was returned and received by Gazelle on January 27, 2017. Gazelle has a 30-day no questions ask return/refund policy. To date Gazelle has refused to refund my $403.03. I spoke with a Gazelle Supervisor Brianna on 01.30.2017, she told me they attempted to refund my $403.03 to PayPal, but the refund was rejected. According to PayPal, Gazelle was 100% dishonest about attempting to process my refund.\nI have spoken with five PayPal agents, who have failed to provide process the charge back credit or refund to my account. The agents I spoke with are PayPal agents Jeannette, CSR, Matthew Supervisor, Aaron, Supervisor, Charnetta, CSR, and Disputes Representative Colleen, neither one of them could say for sure when, or if my $403.03 would be refunded or charged back as a credit to my account. I will say that Charnetta showed empathy and concern. The rest of the PayPal agents could care less.\nI returned the product within (9) days of receiving it within the same condition it was shipped to me in. PayPal was provided with the USPS Tracking# 9201990113668003715528 for the return. They have refused to verify the tracking.\nThey are allowing this vendor to wrongfully keep $403.03 for merchandise that returned a month ago. My refund should have been credited back to my account almost immediately. This is another one of those BIG businesses...too BIG to care about its consumers. Shame on them for not treating their customers like they would want to be treated under the same circumstance.\nInstead PayPal supports the “willful, intentional, and malicious” financial injury of allowing consumer accounts to reflect balances they really do not owe. I returned the product within (9) days of receiving it, in the same condition it was shipped to me in. My refund should have been credited back to my account almost immediately.\nI am demanding that the $403.03 is credited back to my account with no more delays and excuses. I need in writing from PayPal a definitive date of when they will be applying the charge back credit or refund of $403.03 to my account.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T23:14:08.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

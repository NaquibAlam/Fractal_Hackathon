He was absolutely fantastic! His customer service is superior! He did an outstanding job and was very professional and patient with me.\nI purchased a leather living room sectional with a total price of $1,375.88. The salesman advised they offered same-day delivery for $75. I asked him if the delivery service accepted credit cards and he said yes.\nA few hours later someone called me from the store and advised my furniture has been loaded onto the truck and they were en route to my house and the delivery driver himself will call me once he gets there. This person told me it was cash only and he reconfirmed the price at $75.\nAbout thirty minutes later the delivery driver called me and asked me if I lived in a house or an apartment. I said apartment; he asked what floor did I live on; I told him the second floor. He then told me it would be $80 because I lived on the second floor. I said ok.\nI work at night so I was in bed when he arrived. My son came to me and said that the delivery guy was asking for his $80. I asked is he finished already? My son said no he wants the money up front and hasn't moved anything in the house yet. I said ok go ahead and give him the money and then I got up.\nThe delivery guy pointed out three areas to me where he caused damage to my sectional while bringing it inside of the house. He said he had a marker that could get rid of the damage. I told him I will wait to see what it looks like once he is finished putting it together. He then told me that he should have charged me more because the sectional had a recliner to it which is a moving part and he charges more to move furniture with moving parts. He also went on to tell me that if I didn't accept the damages on the furniture he would charge me more to re-delivery another sectional to my house. I just listened to him because it didn't make sense for me to have to pay for damage he caused to my sectional. After the delivery guy put my sectional together he left. He did not say good bye, he did not ask if everything was ok; he just simply put the last piece together and walked out without saying anything.\nI am 37 years old and I have plenty of experience with purchasing things that need to be delivered to my home and this was the worse experience I have ever encountered. I was told that American Freight contracts out their delivery drivers. American Freight needs to get rid of this one. He was rude and very unprofessional. I feel like once American Freight got my money that was all they were concerned about and then left me into the hands of a very unprofessional delivery driver.\nI was planning on coming back to American Freight in two weeks to purchase the ottoman and a set of end tables for the living room that I saw on clearance at American Freight but because of this experience I will not be purchasing anything else again from American Freight. I am going to stick with American Signature Furniture and Ashley's which I started to do because I have purchased sets with them before but I wanted to try something different.\nI would like a manager to call me back because I am very curious what the outcome to this complaint will be.\nSale # 225687 Receipt # 504460 - Horrible Delivery Service", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T14:35:30.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

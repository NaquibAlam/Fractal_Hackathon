I order this medication frequently on a monthly basis. Since beginning this treatment and having medication delivered the company that I go through chooses to use Purolator as their delivery option. Every single time I choose one day delivery and it ends up taking Purolator 3 to 5 business days from leaving the facility in Ontario to make it to Edmonton! One time Purolator lost my package delivered it to the wrong address and refused to take responsibility for the package leaving me out of $200. It didn't matter who I spoke to about the incident nobody seem to care, and I was left without my prescription and out $200. Every time I call Purolator and speak to a customer service representative all I get in return is attitude, poor service, and frustration! It doesn't matter who I speak to you I feel undervalued as a customer and unappreciated. I have asked my provider if there is another delivery company that I could use and unfortunately the only one that they choose to use is Purolator despite my continuous calls of complaint about Purolator. Because of Purolator I will be switching producers and it's unfortunate that I must change my means of medication and they must lose a customer based on the actions and service of a well-known and reputable company such as Purolator. It is ridiculous and uncalled for. If I had an option to give them less than one star I totally would. Shame on you Purolator!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T10:19:55.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I've spoken to the store manager and he agreed my order wasn't correct. My theory(because its open 24 hours) and a travel center location,they figure by the time you've noticed your order is wrong, you're on the freeway and aren't turning back. It's only this particular Starbucks that I've had a problem with.... you bring it to their attention and the worker's are annoyed,REALLY?

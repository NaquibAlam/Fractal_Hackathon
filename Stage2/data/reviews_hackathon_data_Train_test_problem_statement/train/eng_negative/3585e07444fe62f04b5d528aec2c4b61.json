Had to wait days for DHL to come and collect, ship back, and then get a replacement pair. During all of this I chased a number of times, but no one answers or responds to emails - a complete lack of communication.\nNew pair eventually arrived - wrong colour. They expected me to wait in again for DHL, ship back and then they would send a new pair. I explained that this was unacceptable. After much arguing and debate, they promised to send a new pair first ... I was told that would be done one day - it was not. I was told it would be done the next day - it was not. I was then told the item was out of stock .... so .... basically lied to and fobbed off.\nIn the end I demanded a refund and kept the item. I must say however, this is by far the worst experience I have had with an online retailer. A total lack of customer service, a complete absence of common sense, no communication whatsoever, and very much a \"don't really care\" attitude.\nA complete disappointment. I would strongly suggest that you think incredibly carefully before you buy anything from this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T13:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:36:25.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

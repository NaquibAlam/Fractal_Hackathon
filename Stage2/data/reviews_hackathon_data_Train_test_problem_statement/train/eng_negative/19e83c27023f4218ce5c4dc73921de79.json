I reordered my prescription for the second time but it has been 2 1/2 weeks (was just as long the first time but I was told it was just a RARE case of them being out of my prescription), my order still says processing. I have emailed customer support twice with no response. I like the prices but won't return a third time because the wait is too long and I can't get any response to tell me what is going on. Not good customer service and I'm still waiting on my contacts that I have already been charged for and a response back from customer support they replied back to this saying that they did respond to my emails but did not I have no such emails but the made sure they responded to this complaint...mean while still waiting", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:50:47.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Ordered a medium sweatshirt, which is what I always wear. Checked their size chart and yes it said I should order a medium. Received my sweatshirt and it's more like an small or even xsmall. I wanted to exchange it ( so I could get it for the same price) and nope they wouldn't budge. I was told I would have to not only return and repurchase (for full price) but I would also need to pay the $5.50 shipping. We have a large family of sports fans and we will NOT be using them again. Terrible first experience! I wish I would have read all the reviews first.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:46:42.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

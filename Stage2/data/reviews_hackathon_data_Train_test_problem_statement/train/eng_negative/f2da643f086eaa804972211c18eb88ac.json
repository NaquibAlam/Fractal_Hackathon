But will make an exception for these guys ! Too many things to complain about but let me highlight the top ones:\nCustomer Service guys are LIARS !! They say random things without any knowledge and will try and fleece the customers as much as they could. Its like bargaining for vegetables in an Asian market. Spoke to 3 agents over 3 hours.\nAgent 1: Cancellation charges CAD 75. Airline doesnt allow name change (This within 10 mins of booking the ticket).\nAgent 2: Cancellation Charge CAD 75 (Charged by Flighthub) and CAD 75 (charged by the airline).\nAgent 3: Cancellation charge CAD 75 (Flighthub) and CAD 150 (Charged by the Airline) total CAD 225 for a CAD 307 ticket.\nI had to explain, fight, scream, teach them the Fare Rules, etc. for them to realize that the airline does not charge ANYTHING for the name change. So after 3 hours of discussions, speaking to one clueless agent after another (they will all try and push you to cancel the ticket), they still had the nerves to charge me CAD 40 as charges for change of name within 10 mins of booking (Flighthub charges).\nHorrible agents, horrible supervisor. I had to literally scream at them before they do their job. They did not even call the airline till i absolutely asked them to. And they LIED saying that they did, They lied AGAIN and AGAIN.\nFirst time using this website and had the worst experience ever. First website in Canada that has charges for any cancellations/modifications within 24 hours of booking. No other website (including airlines) have any charges within 24 hours.\nAvoid this website if you can.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:15:03.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

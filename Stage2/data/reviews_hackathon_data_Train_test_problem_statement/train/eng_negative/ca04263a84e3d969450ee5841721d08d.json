On the phone, I'm told that it is my fault for not putting a buzzer code. My apartment has a big sign on the very first door that says \"Please input apartment number for buzzer\". Canada Post, DHL, and UPS have had no problems ever in the past understanding the sign and I've always received shipments from them.\nI asked over the phone to attempt another delivery the next day. I was told this was no longer possible (despite their website saying to call up and schedule a delivery).\nI have no choice who ships my parcels from Amazon. From the times that I have had my parcels shipped through Purolator, I have never (I really mean never) received my package without a hassle. The driver's don't seem to care. Its an ongoing issue that others are having as well. Management does not seem to care either as this issue has been ongoing for years.\nI have not received a response from customer care, who advised me to contact them regarding these issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T14:57:35.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

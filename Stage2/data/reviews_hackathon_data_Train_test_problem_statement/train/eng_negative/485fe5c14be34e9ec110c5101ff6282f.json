I normally play the online slots and was lucky enough to get my winnings up to over £1000 so I withdrew them to my account. Now I've made withdrawals of £500/£600 before with absolutely no problems so didn't expect any this time either, and they're normally pretty quick, sort of 2-3 days. So I checked my account and there was no money deposited, no need to panic so I waited the maximum time stated on their website (5 working days) still no money. So I contacted them by email to ask if there was any issue I should be aware of. 12 hours later, no reply to my email. So I decide, I'll ring them and find out. I am told that there was a problem with withdrawals on the date that I happened to make my withdrawal request. So far it has been two full weeks, I have spoken to 5 different people by phone and sent (I've lost count so this is an estimate) 40 or so emails about it. Keep being told they are working to resolve the issue but basically it comes down to they couldn't possibly care less. You know you're in trouble when the customer service people start quoting their terms and conditions at you. I was not aware that they had such a bad rating on Trustpilot but I would urge anyone thinking of using an online gambling site to look elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:54:50.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

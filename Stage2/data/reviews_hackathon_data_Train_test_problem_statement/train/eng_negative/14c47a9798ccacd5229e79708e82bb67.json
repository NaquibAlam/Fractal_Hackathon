The swimsuit was all stretched out, as if someone had worn it a couple of times. Size small seemed like a size medium, but I couldn't confirm since all the tags and labels were ripped off, literally ripped off!!!. There were laces on the side and the loops that held the laces were falling apart. The breast cups that were inside the swim suit was bent. My hands were also black from the ink coming off the DRY swimsuit. The whole design of the swimsuit seemed as if someone had slapped everything together and sowed it by hand... Never will buy from this company again. So many regrets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T15:44:52.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

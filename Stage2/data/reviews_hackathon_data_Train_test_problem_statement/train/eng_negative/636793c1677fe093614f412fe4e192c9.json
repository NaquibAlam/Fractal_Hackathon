Trying to figure out what it was I wrote amazon.com, since I'm more comfortable with English than German, being from Denmark. They informed me that I should speak to amazon.de.\nI went to amazon.de, even though I complained about it to the Amazon.com employer.\nAt amazon.de I asked to get a call, and get's a call from an automated German speaking voice(you'd think once they know it's not a German area code, they'd use an English speaking voice, but no...) German it was, and I had to press some random number. I got some German guy, who did not speak English(who does not speak English these days), but transferred me to an English speaking agent.\nUnfortunately she was not able to find my address, even though spelled it out to her(several times), and I used the address confirmed by their own automated order confirmation email. Apparently she can't access my account if she can't find the address in her system, though they know how to send items to my address and apparently deduct money from my account.\nI'm not sure if it was the system or the employee, but spending an hour(so far) to get EUR 2.99 is just plain insane, but I do not want them to deduct that amount every month, and think they can get away with that.\nI asked for an email address, which she gave me(first she spelled out for me, and I double checked it spelling it out to her), which of course was wrong, so I had to google it myself... It seems amazon, is going down the drain.\nSince I haven't got a receipt, since I contacted amazon, to find out why they deducted money from my account, I'm not sure if this gets accepted by trustpilot. But I'll make sure to warn people at other sites, if trustpilot can't be taken serious anymore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T07:12:18.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

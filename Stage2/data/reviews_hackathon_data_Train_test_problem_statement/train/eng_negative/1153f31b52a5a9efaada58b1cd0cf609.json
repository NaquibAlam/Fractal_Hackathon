The support team was always willing to help but the problems persisted. A month later, I can say that the system in terms of call quality is good, it has a lot of good options in regards to monitoring agent´s activities.\nIt may have worked well for other customers, but my experience has been awful. I´m still experiencing issues, thinking about switching back to the previous provider.

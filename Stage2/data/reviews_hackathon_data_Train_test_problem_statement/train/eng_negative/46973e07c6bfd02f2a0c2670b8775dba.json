When I woke up the next morning my friend had surprised me with tickets (and they were in hand), I called to cancel.. unable to but it was suggested to resell them on stubhub. Then the shipping date got changed for whatever reason and I didn't get them in hand until 2 days before the event which made it impossible for me to resell them online. Also, face value was $100.. I paid $117, then an additional $100 in fees and shipping. It would be nice to have a 24 hr option to cancel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:36:04.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

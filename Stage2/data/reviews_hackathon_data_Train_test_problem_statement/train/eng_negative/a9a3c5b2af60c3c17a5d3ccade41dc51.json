They've always found great business class rates for me and my friends (took 4 others to Africa, 2 others to Central America).\nBut at some point they sent me a \"thank you\" credit for $200 for the business I had directed their way so this time I decided to \"use\" it for the trip to Central America (with another couple) only to be told that it didn't apply for this trip! Some thank you! We had just purchased nearly $5k worth of tickets but the $200 credit they had offered didn't apply? The discount is minimal... the treatment speaks volumes on how much they value my business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T19:48:57.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

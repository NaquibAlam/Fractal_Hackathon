On Friday, they tell me that they needed to check with Dr. about prescription. But never told me they didn't get through to Dr. On Monday, I called and told them if they didn't ship out that day, I would have to cancel because it had already been 5 days since ordering and I was running out of contacts. They finally cleared my prescription and shipped on Monday. Only to find out it will take over a week to get the product. I didn't get my contacts until the FOLLOWING Tuesday. if I had know how long it would take, I would have chosen a different company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:17:29.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

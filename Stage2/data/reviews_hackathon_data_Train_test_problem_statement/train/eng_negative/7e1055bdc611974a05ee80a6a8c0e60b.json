It is our only shower and is now inoperable with no ETA for a fix. Received in November, paid a plumber to install it.\ntoday the replacement cracked in the same place with water spaying everywhere. I called efaucets and apparently I am the only one that has experienced this issue, let alone twice. They are still stocking and selling this shower - avoid them.\nI can not recommend Elizabethan Classics or efaucets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:37:24.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

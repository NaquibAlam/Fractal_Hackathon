I tried phoning them, but I got ring tone and then was unable to leave a message, it just cut off.\nI also tried live chat, but was left waiting for over half an hour.\nI went on to review sites and found that others had had the same experience.\nSo, after no response to any form of contact, I went onto to Twitter and Facebook and Trust Pilot.\nMy original review was removed because I used words like 'theft' etc, but to ignore calls, emails and no live chat, as a consumer, it is pretty scary to lose money and none of the so called contact numbers seem to work.\nPeople lose money every day on the internet, and naturally I believed that I had been hoodwinked.\nAfter a long time and many reviews, I finally got an email from Keller Sports, who said they had not had my order!\nThey did refund my money in the end.\nHowever, this has never happened before.\nI cannot say whether they are reputable or not, they certainly gave me a refund which is good.\nI would not use them again though because of the stress they caused and because their phone number did not work, they did not respond to emails and their live chat was non existent.\nThey did however, respond via Facebook.\nI would not say use them with any confidence. There must be better sports shops out there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T20:10:25.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

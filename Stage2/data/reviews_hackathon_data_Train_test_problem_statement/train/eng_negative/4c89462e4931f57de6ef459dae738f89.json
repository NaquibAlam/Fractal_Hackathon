Blocked traffic by not pulling truck all the way to curb on a narrow street. And parked on no parking side. Told several drivers (my neighbors) they didn't know how to drive.

Enough to scratch leather on bottom of couch. Then told me I should of signed a waiver so it's really my fault. But that's OK cause he colored it in with a marker to fix it. And that's what I really wanted was a new leather couch with a scratch, fixed with brown marker.

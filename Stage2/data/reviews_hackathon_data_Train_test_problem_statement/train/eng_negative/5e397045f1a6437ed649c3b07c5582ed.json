It was not installed until Aug 8, 2013. It was supposed to be warranted for 10 years. On Feb 14 2017 the 3 way diverter broke. Was advised that the part was not warranted so we purchased the diverter. Sent a diverter that looked incorrect. With instructions that did not represent our tower. Then sent 2 more instructions. They insisted it was correct and told us to install it. Which we did and it did not work. It has now been 14 days and they asked for a movie to show the problem. Have not heard a response to date. This is the worst company we have ever had to deal with. DO NOT trust their warranty or their staff to help when something goes wrong. I will never buy from Hudson Reed again and will not recommend them for their product or their after service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T10:49:20.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

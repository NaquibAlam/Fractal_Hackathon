I realized very quickly that there is something wrong when at the collection desk I was offered the options of €1900 deposit (€200 or €250 is the usual rate with Avis or Europcar who I normally use) or special insurance of €70 and still an excess of €200?!?!? At this stage I was about to go to another rental company, but apparently had to pay a penalty of €70 for not collecting the car which almost made me laugh. At the inspection of the car the guy was trying to rush it as much as possible, assuring me that there won't be an issue if something gets missed and even at couple of scratches they haven't penalized people for. Unfortunately for me I missed a small scratch on the external mirror which wasn't visible due to the sun and white plastic. I only noticed it when we arrived at the hotel, but didn't really think much of it. Only when I returned the car I was pleasantly surprised with a bill for €440 including administration charge of €150!!!, loss of use-€40 etc. Despite all the arguing and two additional witnesses I was given the option to pay the €400 or not get the €1900 deposit refunded or continue arguing and miss my flight. :-) On top of it there was no one at the company desk to complain to.\nClearly a company I will never use and highly recommend the same to everyone.\nP.S. - I just spoke with my bank and apparently they are already under investigation by MasterCard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T01:02:27.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

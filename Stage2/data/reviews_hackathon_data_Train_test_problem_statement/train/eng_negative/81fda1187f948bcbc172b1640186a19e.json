I had to call to see what was going. No email.. no notice. I have been Ordering for about 7 or 8 years now. I AM VERY VERY DISSATISFIED. It is in backorder and now I have to wait another 2 weeks.. A MONTH AND A WEEK TO RECEIVE MY ORDER.\nOpti contacts apologizes for this mishap.. however.. you are not selling shoes or purses.. you are selling a contacts and glasses and this as far as I'm concerned is a necessity. I don't resolve anything with your apologies. If you wanted to help after a two week back order disaster such as this.. upon receipt you should send it to your customers overnight. THAT'S how you apologize for the inconvenience. Again.. I have been a very long time client.. and it is the least that you can do. The truth of the matter is that your customers don't mean anything to you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:38:01.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

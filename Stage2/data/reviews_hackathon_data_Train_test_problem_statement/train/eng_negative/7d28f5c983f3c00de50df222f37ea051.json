As a result of this, we regret to inform you that your booking has been cancelled.\nPlease accept our sincere apologies for this inconvenience. Rest assured, we will immediately refund the entire amount that was charged for this booking via the same card you used to make the reservation. Please note it may take few days for the refund to appear on your accountâ€™s statement.\nWe contacted both Quantas and Aer Lingus to find that our tickets were actually still booked, so we went back to last minute and asked them what was going on.\nWe were again told that it was the airlines that had cancelled our tickets and even though we had screenshots and verbal confirmation from the airlines disputing this, last minute insisted the airlines were lying.\nWe have received two further calls from last minute one stating that last minute cancelled the tickets and one stating it was the airlines that cancelled and they also stated that in their terms and conditions they could change prices if they've made a mistake.\nIt also states in their terms and conditions that when you book a flight with last minute your contract is with the airline so I find it hard to understand how last minute was able to cancel our flights, maybe they hadn't paid the airlines for them???\nAfter advice from CAB we have found out that under Civil Aviation rules we should have been offered the chance to book an alternative flight if indeed it was the airline that cancelled the tickets or a refund.\nArmed with these details we again contacted last minute to ask why we were not offered alternative flights from the airlines, last minute immediately refunded us within 2 hours while still insisting that they had no part in cancelling our tickets and told us if we wanted another flight we would have to take it up with the airline.\nThe matter is now being handled by both the CAA and ABTA as apparently this is a regular occurrence with last minute advertising flights at prices which are just designed to rope people in and then when you've made all your travel plans they hit you with the badly spelled email which we received (above) forcing you to spend more money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:09:13.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

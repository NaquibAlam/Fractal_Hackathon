When I emailed the company responded they cannot see the fault on the pictures I sent. I had to resend photos and argue to finally get a replacement. The replacement came with decentred back wheel and crushed breaks cable. When I called to ask for a compensation for the price of a new cable the person I spoke to suggested that I crushed the cable myself on my way to the cycle shop. The light I bought from them didn't work, and after a week of using the bike the breaks started making such awfully loud noise it was impossible to use them. Turned out the breaks need to be changed, and when I contacted the company again I was refused the compensation for that as well.\nIt really is the worst customer service and the worst product I ever received in London, really recommend you avoid them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:09:03.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

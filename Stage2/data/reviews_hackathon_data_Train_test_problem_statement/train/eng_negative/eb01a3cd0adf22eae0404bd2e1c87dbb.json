Then they did not send the department after I forwarded the email to him. After I pinned down the facts, he just blamed the other department . After arguing for an hour, he said, \"sorry two hours has passed.\" which means that I was right and I should've got my money back and I still want my money back because this is a scam, and bunch of bull CRAP This company is full of CRAP and does not AGREE WITH THEIR OWN TERMS and I would never recommend it and use it again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T17:08:12.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After one week I went into the store and unfortunately the staff member were engaged in a conversation and I was made to wait until they had finished before I was spoken too (I was waiting in front of them), I was then asked if I had received an email/phone call too say the item was ready for collection, when I said \"no\" the reply was well it's not in and I was too call back when I received confirmation that it was in. After 3 weeks I had not had a call/email and contacted customer service, they were really helpful and told me the item had been in the store for 2 weeks. She sent me a confirmation email for me to take to the shop. No apology was given\nI would not recommend the collect in the shop service", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:13:40.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

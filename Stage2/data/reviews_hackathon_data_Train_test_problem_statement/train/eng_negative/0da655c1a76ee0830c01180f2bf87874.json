Until last week, when I encountered a problem...\nI had booked an entire house on Big Corn Island by the name of Brokis Place. Since there was one negative review, in which someone had written that his reservation had not been respected, I decided to give them a call a few days before departure to double check if my reservation was indeed confirmed.\nI ended up speaking to a rude man who told me that the house wasn't available on those dates and that was it.\nNo discussion possible about my confirmed booking.\nI then wrote to booking.com to complain about these people and their apparent scam.\nONE week after my complaint, I received an e-mail from booking customer service to tell me that indeed the house was not available, but good news for me: they had found me a great alternative and if I would book their alternative the price of my booking would remain he same.\nUpon checking their suggested alternative, it turned out to be a double/twin room without even a private bathroom and the price would be 90 Dollars less! I sent them another e-mail asking a whole bunch of questions, but they just ignored all of them, cancelled my booking at Brokis Place and that seemed to be the end of it.\nHere's their reply:\n\"We apologize that our alternative did not meet your requirements.\nYour original reservation will be cancelled at no charge to you, and you will receive an email confirming the cancellation shortly.\nOn behalf of the accommodation, we apologise for the inconvenience caused.\nIf we can be of any further assistance to you, please feel free to contact us.\nThank you again for choosing Booking.com. We hope to be your choice for future online reservations.\"\nDon't book a holiday at Brokis Place and make sure everything runs smoothly with booking.com. If not, they won't have your back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:30:53.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

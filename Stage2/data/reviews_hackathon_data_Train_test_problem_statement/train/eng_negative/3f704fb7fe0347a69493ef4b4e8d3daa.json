It took me more than 1 minute to get all the pictures loaded in the serverside application but that was to be expected. had about 2500 Hi Res pictures to load. After some changing of pictures, we had about the desired result. I took the option of a glossy cover (had no option for better paper so i thought it would have been good quality), didnt mind the back advertising for resnap, if its a good product people can see . Ordered & payed.\n2 days later i received a mail, there were some issue with the quality of the pictures but they can fix it if they get the original pictures through WE Transfer. Replied if they could be more specific, because i was in no mood to upload 25 gigabytes of pictures. So they send me the specific list of the pictures used in the album. It seemed they all were there, all 297 of them(application issue?). Allready tempted to kill the order, I thought let me upload them, if they have the original files, it can only benefit the quality. So i Uploaded about 4 gb of pictures & passed them the links.\nWithin days they contacted me that the book is in production & then it was shipped off, provided a tracking link.\nThe book itself, It looks nice with the glossy cover but when opened and watching the pictures in detail, its bad.\nHave no other word for it, pictures look pixelated, its like that the paper moved while printing, I have made some photobooks before, this one is by all means the worst one. The picture quality in newspapers are better.\nMy advise, Dont bother, there are much cheaper alternatives for better quality. Advertised as a 1 minute photobook took me about 3 hrs alone to upload & filter all the pictures afterwards.\nConclusion: Waste of time & money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T12:28:43.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It has been a comedy of errors and frustration regarding the correct accessories.\nI ordered the ETAC 2 with the Wall Sleeve, the Grill, and the Remote control Kit. First the Grill that I specifically ordered was the Designer Aluminum grill, instead I received the Stainless steel. This does not weather well near the ocean so it was totally useless to me. I had a spare Aluminum and I was force to use it. As far as the remote kit, it came in with the wrong module. When I re-order the correct one still had the wrong module so I proceeded to order it again, this time only to received the Remote Control and not the Module. Al Nieto has all the emails that we have been exchanging for the last month. I consider myself a loyal customer who will stay doing business with the same company as long as I don't have any issues, however, I'm frustrated and at a point that I no longer trust the knowledge of your staff. Consider this comment as someone who no longer thinks that I will get any positive business transaction and will explore my alternative.\nMichael Bauza", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T16:48:37.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

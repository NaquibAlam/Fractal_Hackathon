I rented a truck and made plans based on the fees you Quote: d me. When I got to the storage facility, I was told that there were no vacant units, contrary to what I was told by sparefoot. The storage facility employee was friendly enough but he told me that the fees you Quote: d were not enough to cover the move in. I was told there would be a $15 admin fee but it was 20. I was also told I would pay a prorated rate for this month. The total was to be $60. It cost me 120 to move in. I'm sure that's not a big deal to you, but that was my grocery money and I'm going to be pretty hungry by Friday. I wish you would be 3 your facts before just throwing them out there and taking people's money. I was committed with a rental truck and could not change or decline the unit due to time constraints.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:16:11.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

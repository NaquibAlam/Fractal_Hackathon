It seemed that the items in question were some of the more expensive ones and I was offered 2 options: i) Pay a fixed fee of Â£1 a CD for their return or ii) let We Buy Books dispose of them on my behalf. I asked to be sent a photo so I could assess the quality before deciding but was told they were not allowed to do this. I then asked if they could combine packaging the CDs together to save on some of the postage costs (as in the case of most of the CDs, the postage would outweigh the value of the CD) but they said they could not do this. I asked if I could send a self addressed envelope with postage paid and they said they could not accept this.\nThe only options available were to pay the exorbitant return fees, hire my own courier to pick them up or come and pick them up myself (although they put tough conditions on these last 2 options). At one fall swoop this eliminated any benefit of sending the CDs to them; a cynic might look at this as part of their business model to receive items, reject them on grounds that are then unsubstantiated and then keep them for their own purposes.\nAll in all what started well, ended with a little bit of a bad taste", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T11:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:41:03.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

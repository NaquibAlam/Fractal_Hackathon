When, I checked the new itinerary, the first part of the flight CPH - BRU had been cancelled. I called the travelgenio and a representative provided an alternative flight from CPH - BRU at 8:30 in the morning. As I explained I could not accept since I am working that day and to be mentioned that the alternative means 14h flight just to travel from CPH to ATH. I've been told that the flight had been cancelled by the airline and to call them directly. I said that it is not my responsibility to call and that I would like to know if they can offer an alternative flight from 15:00 and later on or the refund. They finally said that they were going to call the air - company and call me back. In the meanwhile I called also by myself the air company to know what is the situation and I have been told that the flight has not been cancelled (as flight) and to call back the agency, as I did. At the second call they said that they are proceeding with the refund and I asked if I could have in written what they were suggested, but they refused. Then I contacted the company requesting in written my alternatives. They replied that they have received my confirmation and are proceeding with the refund and that I will shortly receive news. I replied back again clarifying that I never sent any confirmation but I was requesting my alternatives in a written professional way explaining all the story from the beginning and asking again either for an alternative flight after 15:00 or the full refund. I still haven't received any reply, while asking for the status every day and I am with two tickets in my hands BRU - ATH and ATH - CPH that I am not able to use if we do not resolve the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:18:28.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Since then I've been fighting to get my full refund. First they said they processed it. Then they said they processed it for the wrong amount. Then they wanted my PayPal account info so they could refund me the missing portion of my refund (I paid via credit card, not PayPal so it's very odd they wanted to send me a refund via PayPal). If they can't issue a $151.15 refund properly, in almost month and still counting, do you really wanna trust them with your eyesight? I wouldn't trust them to make a pair of glasses if they can't even handle simple refunds properly. Plus, if you do have a problem CLEARLY their Customer Service is horrible since they can't even issue a simple refund. Buy your glasses elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:09:08.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

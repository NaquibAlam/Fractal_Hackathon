After 2 shipping dates were missed, and a fake tracking label was sent to my email. At that point I had to get Google trusted stores involved. Google trusted stores handled the situation very professionally, cancelled my order, and refunded me the money. I ended up having to go directly to the manufacturer for my purchase and received a way better deal than Beach camera offered.\nThis was my first, and will be my only order from Beach Camera", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:38:12.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

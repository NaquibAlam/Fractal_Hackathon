Bought tickets to a jlo concert in Vegas on 1/26 was charged a $15fee per ticket on top of the price of the tickets. I didn't get the tickets had to keep calling back for them multiple times everytime I was told I'd get them by the end of the week. The concert was on 2/22 on 2/19 I called and finically they got a hold of the seller who then emailed me my tickets ! I have never had such an awful experience no reason I should have had to wait a month for the tickets !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:20:50.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

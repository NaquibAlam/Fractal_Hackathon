It was delivered very quickly which was not my priority at all and then there was bad news - a recipient had to pay 200 euros additionally. I was put in a very delicate situation because of that and was extremely disappointed that I was not notified that taxes/custom fees would be that much money. If I was provided the correct information from the beginning, I would simply not use this service at all, a representative didn't offer any acceptable solution but just kept apologizing which obviously didn't change anything in the situation. I overpaid where I wanted to save money. Of course I won't be using this company again.\nI got a response from ParcelMonkey stating that all additional fees were not their responsibility, they \"warned\" me about upcoming fees, so they can't be blamed.\nAnd again I am providing an honest customer feedback, instead of stating how smart you are that you warned me, please take this review into consideration, do your research about upcoming fees for customers and let customers know about how much of their hard earned money they will need to pay more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:55:44.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

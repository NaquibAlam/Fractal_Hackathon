It sucks and will definitely ruin the reputation of any business who chooses Purolator as their courier service.\nThe driver doesn't want to deliver the package actually. He just want to dump the package at your front door and gets his job done (if you even call it a job). When it comes to apartment building and you need him to knock the door and leave the package at the front desk, believe me, he won't even bother to enter the lobby. And the customer service specialist in Purolator probably don't care either. All your explanation and complaints won't matter.

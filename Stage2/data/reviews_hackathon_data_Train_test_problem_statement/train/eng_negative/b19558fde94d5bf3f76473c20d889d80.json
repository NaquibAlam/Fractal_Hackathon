I worked for avis\nSo car was great and airport service fantastic, we used the car for about 120km Palma Mallorca to Puerto pollence and back, we flew back Sunday morning so we filled up Saturday to get an idea of fuel usage 7.86 euros. Early start Sunday and refuelled 2 miles from airport 6 euros brimmed.\nMy advice take a video of the cars damage, i did before and after and kept all fuel receipts. So i get home and my initial £95 fuel deposit came back as £86 ?? And another charge £157 for what ? No idea car arrived back unmarked. The damage form had 2 marks, the car had 5-6 all on video.\nSurely this is fraud charging for damage twice maybe three times? Sent emails nothing! So contacting credit card to get a refund.\nNot trust worthy unless your taking there insurance i guess - £1100 deposit refunded so what's the £157 for exactly ?\nGo elsewhere save yourself the hassle chasing\nPosting the before and after video on YouTube as evidence 2moro - enjoy the social media experience", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T16:47:44.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

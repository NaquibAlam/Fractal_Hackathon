There are 3 areas referencing cancellation on their website and I carefully read before sending, I sent by post the disc certificate and the letter outlining reason for cancellation.\nToday I was told they can't cancel as my signature was typed & not handwritten. So I then checked website, no where did it say this, so I then checked terms of business and there it states signed letter. However it doesn't state original handwritten signature on their website in all 3 locations!\nI've asked them to accept my initial letter but it's just very frustrating.

I got my order confirmation and they took the payment on my credit card. A week later they send me an email saying that the model is discontinued and that they can't get it anymore. I called the Canadian distributor (which is also the manufacturer) and they have the model in question still available. I gave many options to SmartBuyGlasses to make me happy and still do the transaction: I ask for the same model with a different combo frame/lens (NO), different models that were the same value before the clearouts price that was showing in stock (NO), models cheaper (NO), models non polarized (which was my original purchase), still NO. After many emails the only things they are willing to do is give me a 5% extra discount (which you can get just by registering to the newsletter). It's easy to sell something you don't have at a lower price and then get the customer to pay more for the same model that wasn't in clearouts. I can't even get a generic store to do a price match since they don't advertise it anymore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:14:27.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

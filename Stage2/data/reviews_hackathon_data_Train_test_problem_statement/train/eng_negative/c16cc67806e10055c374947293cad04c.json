I told them early on that they looked like they were dead, but they insisted on me scraping the trunk for a couple of months. They questioned my planting, but I followed their directions exactly. So, they agreed to send me replacement trees provided I pay another $125. Since I had already invested about $800, I agreed to do it. So, I received the new set of trees in February and planted them. To date, it looks like 2 out of the 5 are also dead. This is a very unreliable company. I will not be paying them another dime!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:23:09.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I returned it and I was nice enough to go for the cheapest shipping option for the return (my mistake) because they said they will pay for the shipping ( which they did ) and I don't have a tracking #. Now, after 2 month they still say that they did not receive the watch. Can I prove it...NO. So , my advise , don't be nice, send the package back with the tracking # so they cannot tell you that they did not receive it.

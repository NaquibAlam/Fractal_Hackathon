She even included in her very long speech which she explained the rules of how to shop in the store, that if we didn't like it we could talk to the owner who was there that day. Ummm ok? She must of read the look on our faces because we hadn't said anything but I'm sure she gets the same look from all the patrons that enter the store after her very very long speech of what NOT to do in the store. My daughter was there for only one dress but we were told we would have to select three others to try on, register in their computer system (after 3 dresses were selected), then go to customer service where they would print a photo of the dress we were actually looking for, then once our number was called we could go to a fitting room and ask the sales lady there if they had the dress. Something that could have taken 5 min took over an hour. I felt bad because girls were busseling about asking if this was our first, second or third dress and I just straight up said we don't want any of these, just the one we came here for which we can't even see if you have until we do all this other stuff. Complete waste of time. After an hour they had the dress, fit my daughter like a glove, purchased it and left. What I learned. 1. As a business owner I will never treat my customers this way. 2. I would have rather given my money to anyone else but them because they wasted my time, however they had the dress that no one else had so they got the money. 3. I don't think there was a 3, 1 & 2 were enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T23:35:21.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Received a reply advising that I should have received notification that orders had been delayed due to supply shortages (I didn't get this email).\nFollowing this I was told I could either wait for an additional 2 weeks for the supply to arrive or receive a different brand but the same product however was told the cost of this would be higher. I asked if I could be sent the bands they did have in stock as soon as possible which I was advised they would be, still took over 2 weeks to receive following this.\nBands seem fine, but given there are a lot of the same products online I would recommend going with a different brand as to wait over a month for something like this without any word until I followed up is not acceptable from my perspective.\nSave yourself the trouble and order from a different supplier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:57:20.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

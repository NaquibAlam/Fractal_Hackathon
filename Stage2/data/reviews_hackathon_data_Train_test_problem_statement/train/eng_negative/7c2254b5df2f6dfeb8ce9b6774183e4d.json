When it was pointed out I was advised I'd get a follow up to bring it in. After purchasing the 07 Jeep Cherokee @ the south side location I brought the vehicle back as the condition worsened. Not because I ever received the follow up call. The radiator has been replaced, however it incurred a deductible in doing so. Not having the money to cover it, the lot now has the vehicle hostage. Since the vehicle was delivered to me in this condition I shouldn't be responsible for the deductible. Now this is hindering me and effecting my livelihood. The lot seems to care more about $50 than the customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:38:56.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

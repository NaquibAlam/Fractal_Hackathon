When it arrived on my doorstep the package was torn open on one end and part of the bare axle was laying on the concrete. There was minimal damage in multiple spots around the lug plate of the axle. It doesn't appear that it will affect the products operation but I won't know until it's installed. And there was either no packing slip shipped with it or it fell out somewhere during transport. I would think with something that heavy that it would be packaged with more protection than just a small/thin piece of cardboard. Very unhappy. Everyone knows that shipping companies such as the one used here (UPS) are hard on packages so it's important that they're packaged accordingly", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:50:07.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

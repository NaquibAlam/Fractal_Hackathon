Saw the horrendous booking fees of about €40 per ticket too late. Couldn't cancel the booking. Would have saved €80+ on Ticketmaster. Funny enough, the tickets I was finally sent were purchased via Ticketmaster. My mistake to fall for it, but still misleading and scammy. Never again. If I had burnt €80, at least it would have been warm for a second or two.\nPS: If I had sold them for the retail price on viagogo I would have made an even bigger loss... because of fees... again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:39:25.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

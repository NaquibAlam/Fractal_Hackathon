My torque converter went up in my 07 f250 decided to get a tc from KT Performance. After asking the gentlemen 100 questions about how to install and if there are any \"special\" procedures to take. They told me to install as I would an oem torque converter. Never sent instructions and was told there are none!!!! Long story short KT performance ended up costing me a new transmission after their POS Torque Converter welded itself to my input shaft. Called them up explained what is happening, they end up sending me the instructions after burning up my transmission. They proceed to tell me if I sent both converters to them they may be able to look into this?!? First what the heck does that mean. Second I would have to pay for both the converters getting down to florida where this horrible company is located. Anyways haven't heard a thing back from these guys, the way KT performance deals with in happy customers is that they ignore you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:01:43.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Please note that we do not accept online statements.\nI have used the same documents to verify at every online casinos so it is nonsense and lucky for me I never deposited or got to the withdrawal stage but I imagine if you did take a picture they would come back and say the picture is not clear or readable, if you do a review search on the site you will find it rife with complaints of people not getting withdrawals or demands for documents then accounts frozen including a 66 year old sick pensioner I would not trust this site at all and although I was not affected I am posting this to give you a heads up !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T23:45:57.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

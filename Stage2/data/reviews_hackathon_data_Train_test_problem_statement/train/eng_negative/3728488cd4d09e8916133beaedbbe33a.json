Upon pick up we saw that there were many damages to the car and pointed it out to the garage personnel. The garage personnel confirmed the damages and showed a damage list that was very long for the car. However as it was in Italian so we could not confirm the individually damages but we trusted the staff. We had to return the car early in the morning after the rental period to catch a flight back. There was no one in the garage, but this was not a problem according to the staff, the key could be dropped in a postbox.\nNow 8 weeks later we have received a letter from Europcar that they have found damages on the car that is not on the damage list that we have signed. They want to draw more than 600 EURO from the credit card to compensate for the damages.\nLuckily we took photo of the car before pick up that shows exactly the same damages as Europcar claim were not there.\nBe very carefully with this company, it is intentionally fraud ..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:02:47.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Was called during the day by servicing stop that specialist oil needed(additional cost). Agreed reluctantly.\nWhen vehicle returned, there was remains of the mechanics lunch in the car ( don't worry it gets worse).\nLooked over the work carried out and compared to service report received from servicing stop. The car had hardly been touched. Air filter not replaced, brakes not bled, bonnet fluids not topped up, hose leak not replaced (fumes coming into cabin), water pump needed replacing (car broke down while driving and lost power steering,luckily I managed not to crash the vehicle. Charged for specialist oil that was never required.\nEmailed customer service on numerous occasions for answers and details of the garage used. Photographic evidence and independent garage report sent to them. But yet to receive any answers. Customer service is non existent.\nI have contacted Citizens Advice and details have been forwarded to Trading Standards.\nAvoid these guys like the plague.\nRak", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:28:15.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

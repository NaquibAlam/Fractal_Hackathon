The representative kept arguing that the leggings I chose are not the 2 for $24 price when it clearly was showing me that they were. She even deleted one of my items from my cart before asking me, just assuming I wouldn't want it now. I had to ask her to put it back into my cart and keep asking her to check the price again. If it's advertised for that price, they have to give it to us. She eventually put me on a brief hold to figure it out and/or ask somebody and came back to finally tell me that I was right. My total order was $40.00 as it should be, which is a BIG difference from the $90.00 it was originally charging me. This whole process took WAY TOO LONG! After too much time spent on problems on the site and the long phone call, it took a total of over an hour just to place this one small order. Very unacceptable. I will never order from here again. : /", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T11:20:29.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

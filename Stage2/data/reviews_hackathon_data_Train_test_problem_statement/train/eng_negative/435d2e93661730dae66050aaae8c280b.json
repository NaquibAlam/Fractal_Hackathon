Their tracking availability was non existent. Even entering the tracking number on the UPS site showed no information or updates. It took 1 week to get my order to my town, I ordered an outerwear jacket, they then transferred the order to USPS for final delivery. Huh! Didn't know a transfer like that could be made... Nevertheless, the order took way too long with no supporting tracking information to provide comfort on delivery.

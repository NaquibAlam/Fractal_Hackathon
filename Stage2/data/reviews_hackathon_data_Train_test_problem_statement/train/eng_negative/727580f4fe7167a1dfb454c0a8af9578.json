From their reputation I knew we were going to get screwed, but even I hadn't envisaged quite how terrible the experience would be.\nOf course our first contact was with the 3rd party company within hours of making the booking. They told us it was impossible to cancel or make any amendments as we had a 'special offer', and there was no price we could pay to have the car for one more day (not because it wasn't available, but because those are the rules). Next we spoke to the Goldcar customer service centre. Same response. They advised that upon collection of the car we enquire with the airport desk about taking the car for the extra day. I didn't hold out much hope for this approach, but I didn't want to write off the entire cost of the booking and go with another company without at least trying.\nWe knew we were in the wrong as far as their rules go, so we didn't go in guns blazing. In fact we had made a very conscious plan of how to deal with it. Both my girlfriend and I have both previously worked in customer services, including call centres, and are very sensitive in our approach when on the other end of things. Furthermore, she speaks fluent Spanish and Catalan so we thought it would be helpful for her do the talking and conduct everything in the native language of the Goldcar staff.\nWe were immediately and firmly told it was not possible to make any change and there was no amount of money that would allow it. Well, that was somewhat to be expected. So, a change of tack: what is the penalty for late return of a vehicle if circumstances don't allow us to return it on time? \"Don't do it\" we were told sharply. This exchange of 'yes, but if someone brings a vehicle back late for whatever reason...' and 'don't do it' went on for some time. At no point were we asking for any Goldcar representative to condone bringing the car back late, we just wanted to know what the policy of our contract was. It's as reasonable a thing to ask as what the insurance excess is for breaking a wing-mirror, and surely must be in the contract, but apparently we were not allowed to know.\nThe staff member had been rude and defensive from the very beginning and at some point, mid-conversation, wondered off to another customer (who incidentally was irate about some other issue that I didn't quite catch). He left us in the hands of a monosyllabic woman who had been sat there the whole time with her face buried in her computer, and we were led to understand that that was the end of any further dialogue and now it was time for the paperwork. After some grunting and keyboard tapping she instructed me to put my card in the machine which informed me they wanted 230+ Euros from me.\n'Is this for the extra day?' I asked.\n'No, for fuel and insurance.'\n'I don't require the extra insurance because I already have a separate annual policy for hire cars'\n'It doesn't matter, you have to take our insurance.'\nFor the previous week, Doyouspain had been emailing me to advise me to take their insurance as it would be cheaper than buying it at the pickup location, but luckily I didn't do it as I already had my own policy, and it transpired that if I had have taken it, Goldcar would have apparently forced me to take theirs anyway.\nAt this point a 3rd customer had entered the office and was having an argument about some other issue with the guy we were originally speaking with and I decided to cut my losses and go to a different company.\nOf course I lost all the money I originally paid, and never even saw the car I had paid for, but even after having to go with another company at the last minute at the airport, which is undoubtedly normally the least economical way of doing things we ended up with paying less than Doyouspain +Goldcar's hidden charges (and that's not even considering whatever they would have fined us for the late return - which they never did reveal). The lady at the Sixt desk we went to was basically everything the staff of Goldcar were not, and I know where my business will be going in the future.\nMy initial disappointment with the experience after making an error with the booking has effectively become redundant. Even if that mistake hadn't have happened, we'd still have been faced with a 230+ euro bill upon collecting the car when we were fully under the impression that the booking was complete with Doyouspain in advance. On top of which, the staff were defensive, rude and deliberately unhelpful; although from what I have heard about the company previously, and from what I personally witnessed with every other customer in the 20-odd minutes I was in their office I can start to sympathise with their situation as it must be very difficult working for a company with such levels of customer dissatisfaction.\nIn conclusion, if it seems to good to be true then it almost certainly is.

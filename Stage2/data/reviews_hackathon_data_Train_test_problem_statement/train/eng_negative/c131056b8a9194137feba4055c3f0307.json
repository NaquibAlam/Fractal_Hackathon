After almost of month of numerous email exchanges and videos, and only after posting bad reviews, now they email wanting to know how much return shipping will cost. Not that they will pay for it, not that they will refund or replace the product, but how much is shipping. So now I guess they expect me to find out cost of return shipping, email them again, and wait for them to make a decision if it is worth returning the product or if they will cover the cost of the return for a DOA product. I am just so tired of being jerked around by terrible customer service.

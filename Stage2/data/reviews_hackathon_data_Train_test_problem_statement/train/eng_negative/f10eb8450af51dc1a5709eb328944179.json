Not only do they charge extortionate amounts for the \"privilege\" of using them but they also, as i was told on the phone, \"do not have to process anything\". Well, thank you very much Paypal. I am so grateful that every now and then you decide to process things and then make money of our money twice; as a fee and then through the interest.\nI have not had such a bad customer experience in quite a while. The \"customer service\" representative talked over me, though now after some consideration I think it was more like barking over me. She did not have any information to hand and did nor seem to care at all; i know, i know most likely she is an underpaid call centre worker with no toilet breaks but for goodness sake, seriously, maybe learning something about the product would help.\nAnother thing is this amazing idea of having business accounts linked to one person, ONE BLOODY PERSON. What if there are more people working for a business. and be warned if you are not the person who is linked to the account you won't get any information whatsoever, even if you can access the backend of their \"amazing\" platform. transfer money, make payments etc etc etc but on the phone conversations are reserved to just one person. Interesting approach, isn't it.\nAvoid at all cost, unless you are looking to get stomach ulcers and lose your mind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:07:52.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

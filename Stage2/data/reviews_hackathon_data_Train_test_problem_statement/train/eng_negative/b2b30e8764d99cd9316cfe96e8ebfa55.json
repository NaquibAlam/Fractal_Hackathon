The findings reported to Kasamba resulted in those readers continuing to operate their accounts, although some have since changed screen names. Several Kasamba readers can also be found operating multi accounts on other websites such as keen, psychics.com, bitwine, etc....It doesnt take a Psychic to determine what a person needs to hear based upon the question asked. I've awarded Five stars to all 94 Psychics for their \"OUTSTANDING\" story telling abilities, \"Telling me what I needed to hear\" at the moment, pushing back time frames when questioned about why predictions weren't coming to pass and/ or why predictions were changing. The ratings are a real joke. You're given up to 30 days\nto rate each paid session before the timer expires. Most given predictions are further than 30 days away. A more customer friendly option is the ability to rate the reading after the prediction comes to fruition or allowing the timer to remain open until the customer chooses\nto rate. Kasambas ratings would then be awful, which is why this option doesnt exist. The customer is inconvenienced by purchasing another reading from the advisor wishing to rate after the initial rating.\nWho is willing to pay to question why the original prediction didnt come to pass? So, us hopeless individuals move on with life kicking ourselves for using these sites in the first place. Did I mention the One star ratings Ive given that didn't get posted ?!?!\n13 months hoping against hope for months as I couldn't understand why my situation was getting worse while the readers were telling me it was slowly getting better, to hold on for sure, I'd see positive\nchanges next month, and next month, and ugghhhh.\nIn Finale, Kasamba prevented me from burdening my friends & family with tears by providing a wonderful opportunity for me to deplete my finances, desperately seeking true spiritual guidance and direction for my failing marriage & the stability my children once knew.\nNo longer in confusion, I recommend anyone seeking real spiritual guidance, order and direction to lean SOLELY on the ONE that created you & gives you daily breath. For only Your Creator knows the true, honest, just and pure plans for each area of your life AND it won't cost you nothing more than your time.\nREMEMBER: FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT ONLY\nUPDATE 2/22/17:\nZVI, your pay must be g-r-r-r-reat!\nTake the time to RE-REVIEW my account THOROUGHLY & YOU WILL FIND case file #25243 unless that's just as bogus as your readers, \"Philip ZUCO\" using this trustpilot to give your company 5 star ratings.\nI reported PSYCHIC VISION BY MEHR & LIGHT FOR TRUTH for giving me the same exact reading with exact grammatical errors. I sent a complaint and asked if Kasamba provides auto generated scripts / responses for their readers or if these two readers are in fact the same person.\nAMY from the ABUSE department responded stating the following...\nHi, Thank you for informing us of this matter.\nI would like to assure you that after looing into the matter, action has been taken with this member. Please be aware that we are doing are best to prevent any such cases, however, occasionally a member can fall through the cracks. We will continue to do the utmost to prevent any future occurrence of this nature. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience.\nSincerely,\nAmy\nAbuse Department\nMy reply to Amy informed her that the vague response left me feeling uncomfortable and lacked confidence in the reading, it was completely fake. I asked for a complete explanation as to what took place & how this reader was able to operate two accounts. I received nothing. I continued to send complaints to Kasamba about that reader, in addition to others. CS Rep Rotem finally responded asking me to send the session #'s 33549635 & 335494216 for the first reader because\nI \"didn't give Kasamba enough details\" for an investigation. I sent him the session numbers and NEVER HEARD ANYTHING. TO DATE, This reader as well as the others are still operating multiple accounts.\nRATINGS: What a coincidence that I rated EUPHRATES ARSANIAS on Jan 8 2017 and it just appeared in his post Early this Feb 22 2017 morning. It's obvious that you made that adjustment upon reading my trustpilot message, while Good ratings post immediately.\nKasamba had no intention on posting this rating, nor any others.\nRectify the situation by returning $17,000 back to my credit cards you have on file. Meanwhile, screen your readers, re-screen them frequently and revamp your rating system. Also be compassionate for those hurting and coming to your site for help.\nYou should also do a thorough account review before responding to a customers complaints. I have the emails and have printed each reading to prove everything that I'm stating.\nIt's been embarrassing providing this post, as its my fault for spending my time and money. The post became necessary when another reader contacted me days ago for an \"UPDATE\" yet she gave me the same \"UPDATE\" that she's been giving me for months...\"UPDATED- BS\". I spent $60 letting her know that she was full of BS and I didn't bother rating her because you haven't posted my other bad ratings until today.\nI gave an honest review of Kasamba here on Trustpilot, omitting the names of your readers. In your attempt to politely blast me for \"not contacting Kasamba with my SEVERE ACCUSATIONS\", a few names needed to be released. Come at me incorrect once again and I'll be happy to post my readers list so that everyone will know who's the best at story telling and who's not.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:34:31.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

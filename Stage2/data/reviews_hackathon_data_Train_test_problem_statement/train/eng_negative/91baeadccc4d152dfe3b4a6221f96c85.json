To be fair, the courier might've been rough with the parcel so not blaming Wiggle too much on that. What happened afterwards with customer service was a nightmare.\nWe first contacted Barnaby who transferred us to Louise and then over to King L (sorry if I'm missing anybody). We wanted to exchange the damaged bike with another and at that time, they still had 5 available in stock. We made it real clear to have them reserve one for us. In the end, it took close to 1 month of chasing them down with emails to finally get a return slip (their replies were VERY SLOW and usually took around 3 days to hear back from them) and...they told us that the order had been cancelled and that we would be given a refund. WHAT?? We asked for an exchange, not refund! Their reply was that the bike was now out of stock. Err...didn't we say to reserve one for us a month ago?!\nThey sent us another email about our refund and they had the nerve to refund us the amount for the bike only and not the shipping costs. I had to hunt them down once again and after speaking with Harry and then Ardita, we finally retrieved everything that was rightfully ours (in 3 separate payments) minus my time and effort. Truly an awful experience and first time ordering from Wiggle too. Never again.\n(Order# 6220744222)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:26:33.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

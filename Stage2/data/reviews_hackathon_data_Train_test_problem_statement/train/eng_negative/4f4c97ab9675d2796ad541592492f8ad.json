I've placed two orders for nearly $2K each. In both cases, I never received any email from starfiredirect with a confirmation of my order, shipping status, tracking numbers, or anything of the sort. There's an overly complicated customer portal that I'm asked to log into, which is a hassle. It contains tons of not very useful information and features, but no shipping status or tracking information. I don't need a \"dashboard\" (which they provide in their customer portal), I just want to know where the stuff is that I ordered - did it ship, and if so, tracking info.

I went here on last minute recommendations. I saw a few suv/cars i liked and decided on the malibu. Should of known something was wrong when we got in an test drove it and boy the wheel alignment was way off. Had that fixed, had the car maybe 2 weeks engine light comes on. Was advised to take it an in network dealer. Ok did that 3 times. Resolution per the dealer the gas cap was the issue. Ok problem #2 2 months later driving on 26 and the car broke down, towed to another dealer but out of network so they paid as if it were, resolution time chain was broke and while in the shop mechanic asked when was the last time the oil was changed. Advised mechanic we just purchased the car 2 months ago and was advised all that was taken care of. His words exactly \" it looks like it hasnt been changed in years, its dirty , black and all gunked up\" ok oil was changed before it was returned to us. We do our own oil changes and keep all receipts and they are done like clock work as soon as car advises us the oil is low. Fast forward, driving to work and car started making weird knocking noises, i was coming off highway around a very dangerous bend and car cut off , omg!!!! Luckily i was able to coast out of harms way, thank goodness!!! Had it towed to shop and was advised the same thing guy told me after timing chain broke, the oil is all gunked up and motor locked up, now we change and have changed the oil since. Was asked to supply receipts of the oil, did that. I am still under warranty and i was told that they will only pay about 50% for another motor which i was advised by dealer about 3/4 thousand and then labor. I only had the car a year and a few months. I was very happy with the service but after this experience i am very disappointed i was sold a lemon and now i cant afford to get it fixed and i still have to pay for a car thats not even running. U would think maybe they could have done something for me, maybe put me in something else. Im paying on a lemon btw car has been in shop at least 5 times and now it doesnt run at all", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:42:56.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

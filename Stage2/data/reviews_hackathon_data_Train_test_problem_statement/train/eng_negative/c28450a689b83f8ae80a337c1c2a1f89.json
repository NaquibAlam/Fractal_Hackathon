They claimed that they sent my laptop for repair with Toshiba. 2 weeks later I got my laptop back and it was far from what I had expected, the webcam no longer works, they dis-enabled my scroll pad and other features which were compatible with my laptop before, these features are no longer compatible. I called up Harvey’s they told me to come in I spoke with the manager and they attempted to dribble me by telling me to call up chrome if its running too slow, and all the other website which where lagging on the new system they supposedly installed. Then they put a man on the phone who supposedly fixed my laptop. I didn’t know Toshiba's engineers had time to make personal phone calls :/ .\nThis is not the first time I have had a bad experience with Harvey Normans. Be careful when dealing with such an awful company, I remember buying a tablet from them and what saw displayed was different from what the sales assistant handed me in the box. Got home to realise it was china made the battery life barely lasted half an hour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:10:36.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Car was fine and everything went smoothly untill I got home and saw my cc bill. Flizzr charged me sfr 122 for fuel. I mailed and asked for some bill/receipt and an explanation for the charge. They send me a receipt from the gas station of sfr 50 plus a bill from them for sfr 122. So sfr 72 (eur70) to fill up a tank of gas. I complained about the height of the amount, I fully understand i have to pay but this is ridiculous and doesnt compare with other car rental agencies. Sixt , who operate Flizzr in Geneva just charge you a full tank. In response Flizzr credited my account fot sfr 10. Leaving a charge of sfr 112. seems like an extra businees model. Wouldnt recommend them to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:16:24.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

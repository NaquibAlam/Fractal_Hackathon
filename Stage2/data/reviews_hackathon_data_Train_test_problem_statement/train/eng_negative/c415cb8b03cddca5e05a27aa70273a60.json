About six weeks before our departure, my wife got a voicemail from someone who could barely speak english telling us there was a problem with our flight and asking us to call a 1-800 number. Couldn't even make out the name of the company she said she was calling from. Sounded like a scam, but just in case we called Flight Hub using the number from their website.\nTurns out they had to rebook our flight. We now have to leave the night before, and stay in a hotel in Toronto overnight AT OUR COST. We refuse, and they act like we're being unreasonable. They say a manager will call back by the end of the day. Never got a call back, so we called again. They refused to provide any help at all. Again, they acted like we're being unreasonable because we don't want to pay more because of their screw up. Not even to mention the inconvenience of leaving a night earlier (we have young kids, we're now going to have to rearrange baby sitting).\nSo my wife hangs up and calls West Jet directly. They were super helpful and offered to cover the cost of our hotel right away. At least some companies have good customer service...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T17:27:17.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It also contained the tracking number and mailing date of 2/10 which was Friday. When I checked the tracking number on the 13th which was Monday it said USPS had not received the package yet, just the pre-shipment info. The actual package did not make it to USPS till Tues. 2/14, and I finally received it on the 16th.\nThe email I received after ordering was misleading. I believed my package was on the way on the 10th when it actually did not even get sent out till the 14th.\nEast Coast did promptly apologize and actually gave me a refund after they found out I was dissatisfied which surprised me. I am thankful and I believe it was probably just a miscommunication. I will probably consider giving them another chance in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:00:52.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They have improved the annoying delay that occurs when you are having a conversation (last year it was almost unusable in certain situations). They offer an alias / alternate 'local' phone number to make it cheaper for others to call you while you are travelling. But the problem with this feature is that the number receives many spam calls - I am currently getting around 4 or 5 of these per day. This is extremely irritating. The overall cost of the service is reasonable which is why I use it. If they can solve the spam problem and further reduce the talk delay time, then I would give it a higher rating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:59:58.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

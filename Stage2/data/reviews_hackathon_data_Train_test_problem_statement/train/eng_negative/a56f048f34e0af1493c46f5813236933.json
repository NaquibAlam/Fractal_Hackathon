At 3:30 Amazon advised the package could not be delivered at 3:20. I seriously doubt the driver even got out of the truck because they require an entry code for the building.\nI have no control over who Amazon decides to ship with. Canada Post, DHL and UPS have never had any requirements. How is the customer supposed to know?\nThere is an intercom at the front door with 11 names on it. All that was required was to find our name and press the button. Or call us at the phone number on the order.\nApparently the customer can waste a whole day but the driver doesn't tell inclined to even try!\nWorst service ever. I will be providing this feedback to Amazon.vs and writing the Minister responsible for Canada Post who is responsible for this company.\nAppalling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T16:38:04.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I sent photogprahs to Keller, they agreed that the jacket was defective, asked me to return it, and agreed to pay the return postage. I posted the jacket to Germany, and sent Keller proof of the cost of postage. Keller received the jacket 2 weeks later.\nNow it is 7 weeks later, and I have heard nothing more from Keller, and have not received a refund. Keller has ignored 3 e-mails, and when I tried to phone them, a message told me to call back during their working hours, even though I did call them during their working hours.\nTo try to appear resonable, Keller may reply to this review telling me to get in touch with them to resolve the problem but, of course I have already tried to do so many times, and they have ignored me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T20:10:22.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

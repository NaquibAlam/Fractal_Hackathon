I filled out everything on the prescription form. Waited a month to receive my glasses. When I put them on, it was like looking through a view master! Everything was 3D exaggerated and was very dangerous to drive with. The up close portion of the glasses were fine. After a week, I went to my eye doctor and had them check the lenses out to find out if there was something wrong with them or if it was just that my eyes hadn't adjusted to them yet. He told me that there was no way I would ever be able to see through them because there was only 1/4\" of the very top of the glasses that was for distance and my eyes can't even see through that portion. The segment height was way too high. I told him that there wasn't anywhere on the prescription form that asked for the segment height. He told me to have SmartBuyGlasses fix them. I called the support line and they did everything they could to say I ordered the wrong glasses or I must have entered the prescription wrong. I told them the segment height was way off and there wasn't anywhere on the form that asked for it. I told them I wanted them fixed with the proper segment height of 19mm and they said they can't do that. I said well you can't sell progressive lenses without a segment height. After arguing with them for awhile, they said, hold on just a minute. When they came back, they said, I just talked to a technician and they said we can do it. So I sent my glasses back and in about 2 weeks or a little more, I received my new glasses. They were a lot better but, I still couldn't see right out of them. I went back to the eye doctor for him to check my glasses again and the segment height was still way high. Not as high as before, but still too high for my eyes to be able to use that portion of the prescription. I decided to order new lenses from him and what a difference that made. He told me that the materials and technology used to create the lenses were old and subpar. I also noticed that while checking the tracking number that my glasses was shipped from Hong Kong! Anyway, if you need progressive lenses then steer clear of this place and anywhere else online. The glasses have to be put on your face to determine what the segment height should be and every pair of glasses is different because of there shape and how they sit on your face. Bottom line, it was a waist of time and money. It was like pulling teeth to get SmartBuyGlasses to even try to fix the problem the first time. They should refund my prescription lenses!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:21:27.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

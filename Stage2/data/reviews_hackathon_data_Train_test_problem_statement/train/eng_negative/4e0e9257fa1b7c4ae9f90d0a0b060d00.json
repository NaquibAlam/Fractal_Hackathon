Manager called several times during the weeks letting me know that status and availability of the unit. Told the manager that I would be in Friday afternoon and arrived at 4:00. No one there, called number and rang until VM picked up. I came back Saturday morning at 10:00 ready to rent unit, pay 2nd month and rent truck. Was told no units available. Manager not there. I ask if they rented this morning and they said no. Asked for smaller unit and they said same price as larger. Asked if the truck was reserved for us and they said no. This person just didn't want to help. I asked for the manager and they said no one until Monday.\nWent online after and there were 2 units available and reserved them. It's been over the limit for me to receive a call and nothing as of yet. I'm in the customer service world and I am just confused how someone could be that absent minded not to show any care or concern. I don't believe that this person was trained in taking care of a customer or making a sale!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T18:43:54.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

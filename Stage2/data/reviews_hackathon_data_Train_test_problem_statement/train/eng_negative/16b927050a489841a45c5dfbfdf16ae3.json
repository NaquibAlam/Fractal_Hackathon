I went through the web site thinking that I would just enter in the information off my old prescription and not make an appointment with the eye doctor. When I got to the end I realized that I was going to have to have a current prescription. At this point I did not think anything about getting these contacts because it said they would not send them without this information. I bit the bullet and made an appointment with the eye doctor and got an exam. I used my insurance to purchase the contacts at the eye doctor with my new prescription. Next thing I know I am charged for the contacts at lensdirect.com and they shipped the contacts with the old prescription. I now have to figure out how to return them. This is a waste of $200 at this point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:35:40.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

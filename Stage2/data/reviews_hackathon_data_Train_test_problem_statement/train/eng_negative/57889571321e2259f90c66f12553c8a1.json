The cord lock on one of our blinds failed, and because they no longer deal with the company that made the blinds, S&N refuses to repair it. Their warranty policy is to give you 100% of the original cost of the blind if you replace the entire thing through them. So basically you're stuck paying whatever overage they want to charge you for the new blind. To make matters worse, there are two blinds in this room. So if I still want them to match, I have to replace the 2nd one as well. For the 2nd one I was offered half of the original price. Again, I'd be stuck paying whatever they choose to charge over what I originally paid. These were expensive blinds.\nI located the exact same cord lock on Amazon for $17. So my choices are to spend hundreds of dollars to replace the blinds using the S&N warranty, or $17 and fix it myself. Not much of a choice, and not much of a warranty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:07:42.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

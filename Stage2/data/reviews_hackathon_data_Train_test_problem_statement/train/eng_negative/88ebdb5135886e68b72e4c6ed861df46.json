When the email didn't arrive i emailed them on 27th January to see where the product was. I was told to wait for delivery it was on its way. Still no parcel so i emailed on 03/02 was told to give it a bit longer. I emailed again on 07/02 to be told to wait .\nToday i called the customer service department and the lady told me it was in the post office when i told her this was not the case because i have never received a note from the post office to say it was there she admitted it probably got lost somewhere. I told her the order was now urgent and the service was appalling she said nothing she could do but give me my money back. She was really rude so i spoke to manager he admitted they had changed warehouses and no tracking numbers were on parcels. He admitted it was an error but could not send product out urgently it would take another week and half to two weeks.\nTo say i am appalled with service and lack of care about my valid complaint is an understatement i will no longer using the products in the future because i cant trust they will arrive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T23:48:04.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was disappointed when the frame arrived and I discovered that they cut the frame 1/8\" larger in both dimensions than the size I specified. I called and was told that was their standard practice to ensure that the artwork would fit. (There is absolutely NO mention of this on their website!) I explained that my artwork was already smaller than the frame size I ordered, and it would now have a poorer fit, but the sales rep was very unapologetic and made no offer to correct the problem. In the end, I ordered another frame, but used dimensions 1/8\" smaller. It cost me an extra $40 and I'm not very happy about it. It is not likely I will do business with them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:17:21.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This service has been like this for the past 2.5 years. I have opened 6+ technical support cases with frontier but there are no issues between my computer and the frontier back end systems.

The only reason to stick with frontier is that their service is the lowest cost service around (there is NO other hardwired service here - cable or DSL).

You did Not upgrade the flowers. Nor were there any balloons. Are you people for real How can you respond to a complaint and outright lie? I will upload pictures on your Facebook so you can advertise correctly. Avas flowers is a scam! I ordered flowers order # 4134316 ( i included that because this company reports the coments saying thet have no record of the order. So here is my order #) to be delivered the next day. My mother did not receive them on her birthday but a day later. When I called to complain I couldn't even hear the girl because it sounded like she was talking from a school cafeteria. I was told it was not available so it had to go out the following day. When I asked why I was not contacted the response I got was. I only have my notes and they were already out for delivery. At 9am I don't think so they got deliver at 3:30pm.a day late! I could have purchased nicer flowers from 7-11. Please educate yourself before buying from avas flowers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:07:47.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

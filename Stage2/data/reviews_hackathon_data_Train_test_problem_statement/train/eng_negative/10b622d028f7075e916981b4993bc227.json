I was surprised their rate was much cheaper than every other website. I quickly booked, only to receive confirmation for dates I did not choose. I realized the website corrected my dates to fit their cheapest available rooms. I contacted them to correct the problem and cancel within 5 minutes of confirmation. I even tried to change the dates only to have the price jump way up past the competing websites. Amoma kept my money for the room. What a sneaky way to steal money from people, change their dates than not issue refunds. I will never use this website again and beg you to choose a different route as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T01:35:45.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

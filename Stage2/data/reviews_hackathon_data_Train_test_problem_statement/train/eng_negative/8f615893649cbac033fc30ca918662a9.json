It is a great concept, if only it worked well.\nThis is a terrible product. It is expensive to begin with and then I had to pay a plumber about $1000 additional to install it in the garage where the water comes into the house. It worked well for a month, then it simply stopped working. It just stays open even if I use the controller to close it - although it makes the whirring noise to give me hope :(.\nI didn't want to pay the plumber to remove it. Since it stays open, there is no harm in it staying there. I resorted to closing the main valve whenever I leave the house and turn off the water heater and filter pumps to prevent a leak from ruining the house.\nStay away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T11:12:28.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

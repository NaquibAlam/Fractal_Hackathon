We were told it would be 6-8 weeks for our couch. We called at the 8 week mark to check the order, it had not been shipped yet, they said they would call the manufacturer. Called at the 9 week mark and we were told the manager would call us back with answers on way it was taking so long. She never called us back. We then called again at the 10 week mark again with no idea where the couch was. They never called the manufacturer at the 8 week mark. So they told us again they would call. A Few days later they called and told us they would have the couch by Friday and it would be delivered on Saturday. I called on Friday night because NOBODY called back to let me know my couch had arrived. Couch was FINALLY delivered at 11 weeks. BUT has multiple Imperfections (stitching coming apart, worn out spots and a nail head poking through the fabric). So moral of the story is almost 3 months for a couch they assured me would be here in 6-8 weeks and to TOP it all off the couch that is a disaster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:14:19.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

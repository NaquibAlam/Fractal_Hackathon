An auto-dialer for my sales reps to log in and manage their accounts with some CRM and QA components that would help management track progress.\nOur scheduled training was very difficult to get through as the presenter was unprepared and not very familiar with the product itself. A lot of terms that are familiar within the telecommunications industry was used that sales people are not familiar with.\nSomething then was changed in the core programming to make it so the call notes and \"interaction notes\" would not display. Also the history and activity on the fight side of the screen no longer displayed the notes. This was 1 of the 2 things I asked if the software could do, so essentially this change killed 50% of the usability for us.\nOn the plus side when I asked for a different trainer I was provided one who spent a lot of time to help us set up the campaigns and research our issues. However, ultimately this is a review of the product itself and it didn't work for us on the most basic level.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T23:44:08.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

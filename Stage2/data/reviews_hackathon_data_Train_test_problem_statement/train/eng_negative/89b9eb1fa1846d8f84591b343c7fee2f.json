What I got from them is their rude services. Their choice of shipping company with UPS is bad, UPS never delievered my package and by the end they returned to the shipper without even noticing me. When I emailed my complaints, the customer service just chose to ignore you always. Not a trust whorthy company. As I live in Montreal, I paid a several visits to they store, the staffs there are just ignoring you. Yes, they like watching you without even saying hello to you, just watching you till you get out of the store. Yes they have variety of products, but if you want to experience some high qualified service I will never recommend this site to you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T23:38:56.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

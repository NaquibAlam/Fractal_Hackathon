Reviews by trustpilot were high so I proceeded to book. Online process was simple enough and as I proceeded I made sure of dates, flights, all details as it was my first time with this company. When all was done I printed out my itinerary. I looked at it 5 hours later and was shocked to see the flights booked were a month after I had requested. I called Flighthub and spent well over an hour talking to an operator in the Phillipines who at first would do nothing then when she found out it was booked within the last 5 hours she agreed to change but it ended up at full fare plus a $75.00 fee. They switched dates but I couldn't prove it and so it cost me more money to book through them than the airline itself.

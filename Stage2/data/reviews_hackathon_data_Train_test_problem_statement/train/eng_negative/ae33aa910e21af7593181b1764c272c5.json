Paid an all inclusive price for the car including additional refundable excess insurance on-line before leaving the UK and arranged to pick up the car from Palma Mallorca Airport. After queueing for over 90 minutes at the Goldcar desk (but that's another story!), I handed over confirmation of booking to the Goldcar representative who then asked to swipe my credit card supposedly to cover any deficiency in fuel upon return of the car which I agreed to. They hand you a PDA with a blank screen to sign and then superimpose your signature onto a digitally created agreement which they then put into a folder and hand to you. I returned the car at the end of the hire period unmarked and with a full tank of fuel. 4 weeks after my trip I received my credit card statement to find that Goldcar had deducted £235.81 (more than the actual cost of the car hire!) from my credit card for additional insurance which was neither discussed nor agreed to. This is shocking and fraudulent behaviour and according to AutoEurope not an uncommon practice by Goldcar!!! Following protracted correspondence with Goldcar Customer Services they maintain that I've had the benefit of the insurance so will not reimburse me. AutoEurope have purportedly investigated but quite frankly a complete waste of time!\nIf you must use Goldcar for car hire QUESTION AND THOUROUGHLY CHECK WHAT YOU ARE SIGNING FOR BEFORE YOU WALK AWAY FROM THE DESK!!! Goldcar have now had my money for 269 days!\nNOTE TO GOLDCAR – PLEASE DO NOT KEEP POSTING YOUR INANE COMMENTS. I HAVE PREVIOUSLY CONTACTED YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICES DEPARTMENT WHO DID NOT PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE. PLEASE JUST ANSWER THE FOLLOWING POINTS AS REQUESTED:\n1. GIVEN THAT YOU WERE AWARE THAT I HAD PURCHASED REFUNDABLE EXCESS INSURANCE AS PART OF MY DEAL WITH AUTOEUROPE, WHY WERE THE TWO INSURANCE OPTIONS NOT MENTIONED AT THE TIME OF COLLECTING THE CAR; YOU JUST DEBITED £235.81 FROM MY CREDIT CARD WITHOUT EVEN ASKING OR DISCUSSING IT; THIS IS EFFECTIVELY THEFT!\n2. WHY WOULD I LOGICALLY AGREE TO TAKE OUT THE OPTION OF YOUR SUPER RELAXED COVER WHEN I ALREADY HAD THE BENEFIT OF REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT COVER FROM AUTOEUROPE?\nYou have my contact details should you wish to discuss, however as I have previously stated, I will keep posting this review until you refund my money in full.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T12:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T19:17:09.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

In my last order, while I was checking up and selecting in which service point I want my package delivered I realised that my usual post office (ICA Nära Lappkärsberget) was not in the list, so I chose the one that was first in that list (ICA Nära Bergshamra). The problem was that, instead of getting my package delivered to Stockholm-Bergshamra I got it delivered to Bergshamra in Norrtälje, which is one hour driving distance from where I live.\nI called the customer service and they told me that there is nothing they can do but to wait until the package is returned.\nMy feeling is that your response was not acceptable, since there are some obvious problems with the way you display the \"neares\" service point. I have many post service points around my place. I don't think a service point that is 1h by car from my address should appear on the first position of the list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:56:28.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

As a new user, i had , after completed the payment via paypal, to verify my cellphone number. There was a 5 minutes long counter, and afterwards i should have recieved a short call, with a verification code. That call never took place, and i was presented with an errormessage. The status of my order shows complete. I recieved 3 emails from Gamesdeal.com. In one of them i was told, that the key would arrive in a seperate mail.\nNow there has gone 16 hours, and i haven't recieved anything yet.\nI tried to send a message to their support via the link in their email. But it doesn't Work. A banner after sendt message just keep showing Please Wait. I now have sendt an email directly to their support, but i doubt i get anything out of it.\nHonestly, i have bought gamekeys on other sites, and always got what i ordered, within minutes. Gamesdeal.com is the first reseller, i got trouble with. And it will be the last time i ordered something there.\nIf you, Gamesdeal.com read this.

The product was shipped on January 15th, 2017 with and estimated delivery time between February 5th to 10th. I eagerly watched my mailbox everyday as it was to be delivered via Canada Post. On February 10th my package still had not arrived. I emailed Banggood to inquire if they were able to track the package for me. I was instructed to \"wait 5 to 7 more days\" which I did.... no package. Emailed again and received the same generic response. After many emails back and forth with me asking for tracking, possibly resending the package, etc. I was sent an email informing me that they could refund my money OR resend another package. No apologies, no discount, as far as I'm concerned ZERO customer service. I have waited a month and a half to receive product from them and to them it's just an \"Oh well\" situation. I have never been made to feel that my worth as a consumer and my dollars mean so little. I'm beyond upset by the treatment, lack of customer service and general attitude of this company. I can't believe they are still in business. At this point I have been told I will be receiving a full refund within 7 to 14 business days, I'm not holding my breath.... I'm so disappointed. Even if I do receive a refund (doubtful considering their customer service thus far) I will have to source, order and wait all over again to get what I want!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T05:47:24.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Spent hours writing eBay items and uploading pictures everything seems fine. So the items started ending and payments were made. So, I tried to book some parcels using my PayPal account. Nope. They have held MY money and want me to send MY items using MY money to pay the postage? Are these primates insane? I have held an eBay account for over ten years and have 120+ (I don't use eBay that much) feedback from buying and selling in the past and they treat me like this? Absolute joke. Think long and hard before using a company like this they are absolute sharks. No reply to messages, confirmed everything they wanted to know etc. But still my money is on hold. I have held 3 expensive items back until PayPal release the funds or they can cancel the orders and ban me because they ain't getting no more of my money - I would sooner let them rot in my attic for the next couple of decades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T23:15:30.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

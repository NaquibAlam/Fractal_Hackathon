So when it came time to get a new pair of gloves I figured go where you know the service and prices are good. So I purchased a pair of Danise Druid D1 Long Gloves figuring they were in stock since the website didn't show anything different and they offered free shipping. After placing my order I was sent an email stating my order was shipping out of Italy and it would take OVER A MONTH to get them. Since it's still winter here in the North East I let it go figuring I wasn't doing a ton of riding this time of year anyway. However, I feel there should be some sort of alert on their website (Like Revzilla does) letting customers know that the item will take a long time to ship. If this had been in the middle of the riding/track day season and I needed the gloves right away I would have been extremely upset.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:49:47.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

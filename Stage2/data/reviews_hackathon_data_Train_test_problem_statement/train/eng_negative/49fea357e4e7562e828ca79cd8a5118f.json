The third time I called, I was forthcoming with the rep and let her know I'm frustrated and have been on hold them hung up on two different times, I asked for the department number I've been trying to reach and then she asked me why I was so rude and yelling at her (which I wasn't yelling, just exasperated tone). On hold again for 10 minutes only to be told the request I was trying to make can only be done online and can't be done on the phone. What a joke.\nI have never had any issue with Amazon, and would recommend all businesses use Amazon as not only are they substatially less expensive, their wait times exponentially less and staff much more professional.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T03:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T05:14:46.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

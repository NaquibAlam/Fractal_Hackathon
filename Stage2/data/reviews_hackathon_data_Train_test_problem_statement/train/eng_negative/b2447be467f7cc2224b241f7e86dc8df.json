The refusals to replace products that arrive damaged, no refunds, and no discounts for incorrect products that often arrive over a week after you order them (1 to 2 day shipping?!) begin to accrue once you are a loyal customer and Chewy.com believes you no longer need the high quality customer service they lavish on you when you are new to their company.\nI wash my hands of this company after too many instances of poor treatment towards established customers versus the courting phase they lavish on new customers. I was averaging approximately $10,000 a year I was spending at Chewy.com. Not anymore.\nI still haven't recovered from asking them to please remove a review they allowed a customer to post on a dog ramp that read it was \"Good for LOSERS dogs\". I was curtly told by Chewy that they won't censor any reviews even if they contain crude remarks towards the handicap population. I explained I was looking at that dog ramp for a friend of mine that was a disabled military veteran that lost his leg during combat. He has a service dog (a German Shepherd) and I'd appreciate it if they could remove the review some sick person left calling people like my friend a \"LOSER\". Nope! I know they censor their reviews, because it takes 1 to 2 days of review after you submit one. And I've never noticed a review utilizing obscene language being posted.\nAllowing a post that calls my disabled veteran friend a loser for needing a ramp for his dog, set a tone for me with this company, and now after so many bad customer service experiences after being a loyal, high-spending client, I'm disgusted with them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:14:49.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We didn't damage the car whatsoever and when they were inspecting the car, they said WE put a dent in the back of the car.\nWe were shocked. We absolutely DID NOT cause the dent and had NEVER seen it before for the entire 5-day rental.\nThey charged us $2000 NZD ($1400 USD) for the small dent with no paint damage!!! Besides that tiny dent, there was nothing wrong with the car and it cost us $2000 NZD. You could remove it in five minutes with a plunger.\nBeware!! They blame you for their own DENTS and they charge you $2000NZD for it!\nSee the full-size pics and review on the Pastryday blog", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T11:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T08:10:52.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

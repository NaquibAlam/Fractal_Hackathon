System rigged to scam.\nGot a giftcard for christmas. First you type in your giftcard code and press cash in, choose your giftcard and get a confirmation message about the giftcard being delivered in 3-5 working days. Then a month after contacting their super dodgy customer service they ask for the giftcode that i obviously didn't have laying around after cashing it in and getting a confirmation message that my ciftcard was on it's way. Then they say that without it the case is closed from their side.\nEither they have a system developed by a todler or, judging by the customer service, they have a system intentionally rigged to scam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T06:51:33.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

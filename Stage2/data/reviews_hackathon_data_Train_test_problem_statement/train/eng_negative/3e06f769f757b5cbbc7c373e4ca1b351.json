It was refunded into my account 3 days later, during which time I was unable to reach a customer service agent - they have no phone number listed on their website. All I ever received was a generic email, and when I responded and demanded a phone number so I could talk to a REAL person about the fact that they had my bank account information, they waited three days and sent another generic email and said they would \"look over my case.\" I sent another angry reply 2 days ago and said that if they were a real company there should be a phone number to call. Still haven't heard back. Very skeptical of the legality of this company. At the very least, they have TERRIBLE customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:39:37.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The delivery service was poor. During the setup on Friday 3/3/17, they realized that they were missing the center support piece and one of the feet for the drawers. They told my wife that the warehouse didn't put the items on the truck. They then told my wife that they wouldn't be able to deliver the missing pieces until Tuesday (3/7/17) even though she overheard one of them on the phone saying that we aren't going to do it Saturday, we will do it Tuesday. They proceeded to tell my wife that we could us the bed without the missing support piece but to take it easy since for prolonged usage would bend and crack the slats (platform style bed) without the support piece. Then they left. They also left small pieces of styrofoam all over the floor and left whatever is used to wrap the drawer handles on the handles. Extremely unprofessional and fortunately for you, the missing pieces were delivered Friday night after I called customer service. Even then, the men who delivered the pieces Friday night were not told what they were supposed to do. They didn't have any tools with them and I had to supply them with what they needed! Not sure what kind of outfit you are running, but this makes me not want to shop at your stores again! If it wasn't for the Brighton store's salesman (Kyle Nash), I would have given a 1 star (zero if I could) rating. You can believe I will inform all people that I know of the miserable experience that I have received from you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:15:15.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It turned out the hosting plan includes a very old php version (5.4, it doesn't even get security fixes) and they can't upgrade it. They suggested to buy a new hosting plan for more money, which supports php 5.6. Php 5.6 is out of active support now and it only receives security fixes...\nIf you care about security, find an alternative or don't be surprised when you get hacked on a php 5.4 hosting plan...\nI wanted to get a partial refund for the rest of my hosting plan because it is a useless junk in it's current state but they refused it...\nI think, this tells everything about the company:\n1. They sell a product with a huge security risk\n2. To resolve it, you can buy another product\n3. If you don't want to but the another product then your lost your money\nI think, a hosting company should be:\n1. focusing on security\n2. if something includes security risk in their infrastructure, they should focus on to resolve it ASAP and not push their client to buy something else which is another junk\n3. if they are not able to resolve it and the client wants their money back, they should pay it back immediately\nI'm just wondering, what happens if someone get hacked through their security issue...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T06:35:44.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

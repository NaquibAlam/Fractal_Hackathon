I found my self needing a loan to open another location and during my search I applied on lending tree. I was inmidiately contacted by a few companies claiming they can help me get the best deal. After doing my research on places such as trust pilot I ended up going with Lendio to help me. My rep was calling, emailing and texting to the point where I felt comfortable sending 1years worth of my companies financial statements on top of all my personal information, he seemed caring enough and honest in to wanting to help. So here is the issue I read the good reviews and bad reviews but somehow I convince my self i was not going to have issues because he was so on top of my case before I gave him the info. After a week I sent an email and received a very short answer (we submitted paperwork to our lenders, we should hear from them very soon). After two weeks I decided to email again and I swear the email he sends is a generic reply because it was exactly like the first one so I call the office and I was told this was not normal, two weeks without an answer and that I was going to receive a call from a manager. I check all bad reviews and guess what all bad reviews are the same exact situation. If you feel like chancing your entire financial records, bank statements, federal tax id number and social security number to someone who might call you might not go ahead and use Lendio. It's been 3 weeks and I still haven't heard from the manager who was supposed to check on this or the rep who took my case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T21:51:14.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Now for the Bad news !!!\nClearly they are sending out Faulty goods that cost more in postage to return from UK than the original cost\nOf the order and are relying on people not bothering because they say it's the buyers responsibility to pay return cost !!\nH1WH Drone .\nHi, Regarding the above order that I received I am very disapointed that it is not working,\nTo be more specific, the camera/video is not working, it is not showing a picture from the camera\non the app Video_copter, the alert message is that it is ' not connected to the video board ' or wrong wifi,\nI have tried 3 Phones and 1 Tablet, Obviously the cameras circuit board is at Fault.\nI believe that I have had a USED FAULTY Item sent, when I opened the package I found the Box Damaged\non the bottem, , ( Please Refere to Attached photo ) and when I opened the box to assemble the Copter\nthe Camera was attached to the Copter and not in a White box as it should have been..small Box missing, ,\nPlease look at attached photoes for details of order and box condition with outer packaging ..\nIf this cannot be rectified I will be wanting a complete refund .\nI look forward to your reply as soon as possible,\nRegards,\nMike Allanson.\nThe following reply and my response as follows :-\nOn 25/01/2017, 02:49 Quote: :\nHi Friend,\nIn this case, we advise to return back to us for checking and repairing.\nBut customers need to cover return shipping cost.\nPls inform us so to provide RMA#\nRegards\nTaylor\nMy response as follows :-\nHello Taylor,\nThank you for your quick response . But as I pointed out in my email the item that I paid for that was dispatched by yourselves\nwas clearly faulty and not fit for purpose, therefore I am Not responsible for the cost of returning the goods, please read the following text .\nReturning faulty goods bought online\nThe Consumer Contracts Regulations are in addition to your other legal rights.\nSo, if your goods are faulty and don’t do what they're supposed to, or don’t match the description given, you have the same rights under the Consumer Rights Act as you have when buying face to face.\n(. Any terms and conditions that say you must cover the cost of returning an item Do Not apply where the goods being returned are faulty. )\nPlease take note of the last line !! Because the cost of shipping back to China would more than double the original cost of the Copter that I paid for.\nHowever, A solution may be available to us both, may I make a suggestion that..\nDue to the fact that the problem is with the Camera and it's WiFi circuit I would like to suggest that you ship to me a New and Working Camera,\nThis will be a cheaper and less expensive option as it is only a small item and should rectify the problem,\nI look forward to your reply at your convenience .\nRegards,\nMike Allanson .\nAs of today, , Friday the 10th of February 2017, I have not had a response, and I'm not holding my breath after reading so much negativity\nOf this alleged Company !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:43:17.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

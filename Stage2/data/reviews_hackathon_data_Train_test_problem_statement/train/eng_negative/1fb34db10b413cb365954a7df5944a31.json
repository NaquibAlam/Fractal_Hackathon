After selecting the flights and entering all my details, lastminute said that my flights would be confirmed within 24 hours. Two hours later, I received a call from lastminute informing me that the tickets for my outbound flight were now unavailable. They offered a full refund. I was quite annoyed that lastminute had taken the money from my account before checking that the flight was available. I was even more annoyed that I was able to purchase the same outbound flight through easyjet but for significantly more money. It would seem that the price for this flight had gone up and lastminute didn't want to make a loss. Clearly they don't mind taking my money first!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:19:56.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

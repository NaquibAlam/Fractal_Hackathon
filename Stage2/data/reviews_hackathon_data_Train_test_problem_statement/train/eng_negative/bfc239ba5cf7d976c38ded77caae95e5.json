You'd think that any travel agent would want to keep my business, but not these guys!\nSo it all started with me booking tickets for 5 passengers and mistyping one of the names - I missed one letter in the family name of one of the passengers.\nI called Travelgenio immediately (about 2 hours after booking the reservation) trying to correct my mistake, and that's when my nightmare began.\nWhat followed was 10 days of endless phone calls and emails.\nEvery time I'd call Travelgenio, they would tell me something different.\nI would then have to call the airline to verify the information, only to discover that I have been outright lied to by Travelgenio.\nEventually, 10 days after the fact, I was told that I need to cancel and re-book the reservation. But guess what, the price of the ticket had literally tripled during that time!\nTravelgenio have certainly lost my trust and my future business.\nI am utterly disappointed by their lack of competence and their level of service.\nPeople should be warned not to expect any level of customer service whatsoever.\nJust for laughs, here's one of my email to Travelgenio summarizing the situation.\n\"Hi,\nI have been calling Travelgenio almost every day this week and every time I get a different answer.\nCan you please put me in touch with a supervisor or someone else in charge as I no longer trust the information I receive?\n1. I first called on Monday Jan 30th, just a couple of hours after I purchased tickets for 5 passengers to alert you that one of the names is misspelled.\nI was told that there is no problem to change the name of one of the passengers as there was only one letter difference. I was told that Travelgenio will put a note on my reservation for the airline to see and execute the correction.\n2. I talked to the airline and I was told that they do indeed see the note requesting the name change, that there is no fee for executing the change, and that Travelgenio should contact them directly for further information on how to execute the change\n3. I called Travelgenio again the next day (Jan 31st) to see if the name change was being processed\nTravelgenio told me again that they have added a note to the reservation, confirmed that there is no fee for the name change, and there's nothing else for them to do\n4. I double checked with the airline, and I was again told, there is no fee to execute the name change but the process needs to be initiated by the travel agent\n5. I called back Travelgenio to communicate back that information (Jan 31st)\nA lady who was quite rude on the phone told me that there is no need to change the name as there is only one letter difference, and that I will be allowed to board nonetheless. I was assured that there can be a difference of up to 3 letters and I will still be allowed to board.\n6. I called the airline one more time to verify this information, and I was told that it was wrong, and that I do need to change the name on the reservation.\n7. I called Travelgenio one more time... (Feb 1st)\nI was told one more time that there is no fee to change the name and that they will finally initiate the procedure to do it.\n8. Today, Feb 3rd, I receive an email from Travelgenio telling me that I need to cancel and re-book the ticket and that I need to pay close to 500 EUR for this even though the price of the ticket was only 183 USD!!\nWhy was I not told this the first time I called? The price of the ticket was still the same on Monday. But I was being misled for a full week and now the price has tripled.\nI was led to believe that there is no problem with the name and that either the reservation did not have to be modified or that it was already modified. What would have happened if I hadn't followed up?!\nI was assured several times by both Travelgenio and GOL Airlines that there is no fee for executing the name change. I therefore demand that you change the name free of charge.\nI am highly disappointed in your customer service representatives. I was misled and outright lied to.\nCan you please put me in touch with a supervisor so we can sort this out? I prefer communicating by mail from now on in order to keep a record of our conversation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:21:15.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

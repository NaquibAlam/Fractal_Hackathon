Users beware - that great deal has already been taken, but Amoma won't tell you until you click on 'book,' as I found out. Then to add insult to injury, about an hour later, Amoma sent me a coupon for 5% off the same room, leading me naturally to wonder if it had become available. (Never mind how did Amoma decide it had permission to email me, since I had unclicked the marketing box...)\nCurious, I clicked on the offer, only to get \"Sorry, Hotel XX isn't available\" and a list of other hotels. Sorry to get your hopes up, sucker. But maybe we can get you to book one of our other offers?\nAmoma, you have just bought yourself free negative publicity on all my social media streams and a lifetime of bad word of mouth.

I phoned to arrange my annual boiler service in November and was told they couldn't do it until 4th February as they had been very busy due to the extremely cold weather??? Wasn't that cold here in Bristol! I've know much colder winters and always only had to wait a couple of weeks for a service so I complained. My complaint hadn't been dealt with by the beginning of February so I complained again and was told they wouldn't be able to service my boiler until 27th March (today) so because BG hadn't dealt with my original complaint I actually had to wait even longer for the service than if I hadn't complained in the first place.\nWaited in all morning as service had been booked for today between 8.00 and 13.00. at 12.00 I called Customer Service and was told that my call had been issued to an engineer and someone would be with me soon. When no Engineer arrived I called the chap who had dealt with my complaint in February and who was the person who arranged the service for today. He told me that the call had been cancelled 4 days after he arranged it but no-one let me know or him either, for that matter! He said he couldn't understand why Customer Service had told me that it had been issued to an Engineer today, he thought the Customer Service Agent must have been lying in case I gave him a hard time!!!!\nI have cancelled my direct debit and as I haven't had to call BG out during this year's contract and, they clearly, cant uphold their end of the contract to provide an annual service, I have requested a full refund of all installments paid for this annual contract period. They have refused to refund my installments which total over £300 and suggested a compensation amount of £120.00. I have refused this as I feel they have not provided the service they say they can and have therefore broken the contract, meaning I should be entitled to a refund of all monies paid, not to even mention compensation!!! They didn't seem to bothered about losing me as a customer, but they agreed their service had been disgraceful and suggested I take the matter to the Ombudsman which I shall do forthwith.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:08:51.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

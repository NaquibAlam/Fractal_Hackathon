The whole reason for signing up for the fundraiser was to help a family in need during the loss of a loved one. It has been 10 days and the family has still not been able to access funds they were needing to apply towards funeral cost. I think the 72 hour security hold should be it and then they should let the beneficiary have immediate access to the donations. 10 days after a donation and the status is still showing pending after the donations were suppose to be cashed out is just crazy. Next time I may consider other fundraising options to help a family in need ,because in a critical time of need 2 weeks to wait on funds is not appropriate in my eyes. Especially if the contributors had just given cash or even sent it by mail it would have been available sooner then using give a gift.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:21:20.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

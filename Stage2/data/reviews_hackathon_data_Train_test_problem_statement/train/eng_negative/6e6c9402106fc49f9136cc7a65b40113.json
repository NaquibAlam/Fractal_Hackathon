Intoxalock has charged me just over $80.00 for every false fail and I've had to request hearings with the DMV to not have an additional year tacked onto my lease. I feel like this company wants to bleed me dry financially and I'm very unhappy with the service. I know I messed up and had to get the device, but I'm trying to turn things around and this device is making me feel like I'm running backwards uphill.\n* update: I was contacted by an intoxalock representative and was reimbursed for a lockout fee. That has definitely made me feel better about their overall customer service, but I'm still in the same boat regarding my situation with the DMV and the intoxalock device false failing me multiple times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T23:18:31.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

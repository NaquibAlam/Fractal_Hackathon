That is plenty of time for them to get it figured out, especially for a company that offers same-day delivery!!! They didn't make the delivery that day and didn't even contact me until the next day to tell me they would deliver it the day after that (2 days late). Then when it again wasn't delivered at that time, I called to ask what was up and they said it would be delivered the next night and when I became audibly frustrated, they just paused an promised me that the flowers had already been delivered within the past 2 hours. Well, you guessed it; they weren't. So I tried emailing customer service since calling didn't seem to be getting me anywhere and the next day I found out that they don't deliver the specific bouquet to the address I provided (so why did they allow me to place the order?). However, if I wanted to pay $21 more, they COULD make the delivery... I said, \"No I paid for those flowers to be delivered to that address, so that's what you're going to do.\" Apparently this was an impossible demand - to receive what I had paid for - so here comes the part where I give them 2 stars instead of 1: the guy says they can send a dozen red roses ($15 greater value than what I ordered) and then eventually makes it two dozen ($85 more than what I paid for) for my troubles. In the end, they almost made it right, but the delivery was made February 28th (6 days after schedule for an order made well ahead of time), and the item I ordered could not be delivered; both inexcusable facts in my opinion. So, in short, would I recommend Ava's? Absolutely not, under any circumstance. They were an absolutely terrible company to deal with, but thankfully that one kind employee out of the 5 or 6 I dealt with was able to help me out. Oh yeah, and they say they're a local company. Don't be fooled, they're a national company who pays local florists a lower price than what you pay to arrange the flowers you ordered (if you're lucky). Do yourself and your local florist a favor and cut out the middle man. It will save you a massive headache.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:11:37.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

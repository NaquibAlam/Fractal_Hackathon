I urge every single buyer to never purchase anything on PayPal. They have gone bust due to their recent lawsuit in the USA where an out of court settlement resulted in them paying Â£3.2 million because they suspended and withheld funds from a merchant.\nIn order to make up for this they will be using our money they will not pay your merchant the money you paid through them. It is not a secure channel and they have to be sued for the money laundering and withholding customer money from business's. We have a business where customers who paid using their fraudulent card machine device have made payments that they have received but not forwarded to the business. PayPal is a fraud I condemn their use worldwide and I would never ever recommend them to be a trustworthy source.\nEverybody should be filing a lawsuit against them! They have no right to prosper and earn interest on other people's hard earned money.\nThis scam needs to stop and the government needs to impose strict actions against PayPal for breaching all rights of consumer financial protection!\nFrom a local Startup business PayPal is trying to make money from!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:07:21.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The agent told me to pay for the shipping label and send the device, which i did in a day.\nAfter that i never heard back from anyone until i posted a review online sometime in September/October. Esurranty replied to my review on TrustPilot and said they have \"no record of claim from this customer\". However, someone called me the same day i posted the review and told me about the miscommunication that had happened between esurranty and Microsoft. He told me he would have Microsoft repair the device and that the repaired device sent back to me in a week.\nBut again, never heard back from him. I left a dozen voicemails and emails but no response. I went ahead and posted a second review, and essuranty replied back to the response: \" It is unfortunate that there is not a way for us to dispute false statements from customers. The account notes show that your claim was denied because it was a pre-existing issue according to the MicroSoft store when they diagnosed the device. There is not any property/casualty insurance or extended warranty company that covers pre-existing damage or mechanical issues. All approved claims are handled as quickly as possible and devices that are not repairable are replaced unless the claim is denied and then the device is returned to the customer.\"\nIt's funny they claim that the claim was denied when the person who got in touch with me after my first reply told me the device was repaired and would be sent to me. And even if they denied my claim , they never sent my device back to me.\nThey are very good at replying back to reviews and making it look like the customer's fault but they never reply back to your email and try to solve the issue. This is the third time i am posting a review in the hope that someone would contact me and we can coordinate on how to get my device back from them.

On 14/2/2017, I receive an email at 1754hours from the customer service that their local agents are not able to deliver the flowers to my parents.\nI am not sure how my order can be approved and charged to my bank account if the local agents could not deliver to my parents adress. What is the procedure that is involved.\nThis is totally irresponsible of them! They could have informed me earlier and I would have ordered from another company so that the flowers could be delivered to my parents. But no, they had to wait until Valentines Day to tell me at 6pm via e-mail!! Like I left my contact number for emergencies like this for God's sake. No surprise rose bouquet for my parents but just a terrible surprise for me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T04:25:50.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

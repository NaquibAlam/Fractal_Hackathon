You imagine? Suppose you pay 10, when the postman comes you have to pay other 65% of what you've already paid, so you have to pay the postman other 6.5. The reason why this site is a total scum it is given by the fact that there's no mention of this risk at all. Only the possibility of making a \"generic\" insurance. If i was adviced by them before i've placed the payment, i shouldn't have placed the order. Simple as that. The only possibility of having my money back now is on paypal's hands, as i opened a treat with them (lucky me that i have paid w/t paypal? Absolutely NOT! They propose a PARTIAL REFOUND by sending back the items. SO I WAS RIPPED OFF BY THEM INDEED, as even in case of the refound i have to pay for shipping expences to give them the items and I WON'T BE REFOUNDED FOR THE TAXES!). Sorry miinthebox or lightinthebox; in your box there's no light except a total scum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T09:49:50.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

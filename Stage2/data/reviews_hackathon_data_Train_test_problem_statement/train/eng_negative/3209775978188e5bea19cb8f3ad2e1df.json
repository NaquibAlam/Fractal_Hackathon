When I received them(IN A BOX THAT HAD BEEN RIPPED OPEN) they were defective so I emailed costumer service and explained the situation. They said they could send me new lenses that I could replace. So I said ok please send me new lenses. After a few days I get a response saying they don't have new lenses at that moment, but if I could wait 3 months they would have them. This sounded strange and not really nice, but I said fine as long as they would ship them to me as soon as possible. Time goes by and I get a reply saying that they will never get new lenses. What?? But then they go on saying I can return the glasses, IF I HAVE THE ORIGINAL BUBBLE WRAP AND BOX THEY WERE SENDT TO ME IN, WHICH BY THE WAY WAS DESTROYED BY SOMEONE DURING SHIPPING!! SO OF COURSE I THREW IT OUT! This is unacceptable and do not recommend this store! Like, if you buy sunglasses for several hundred dollars pluss import tax YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR AND THEY SHOULD EXAMINE THE PRODUCT FOR DEFECTS BEFORE SHIPPING IN THE FIRST PLACE!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:41:34.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

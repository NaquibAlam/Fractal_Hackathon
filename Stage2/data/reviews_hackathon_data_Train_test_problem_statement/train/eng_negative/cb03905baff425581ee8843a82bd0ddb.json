I order a week ahead so it will be there on time. On Valentine's Day, I receive an email stated that it will be a day late. Hello!!! That's why I order a week ahead to be on time. They email me exact on Valentine's Day and I wish they would let me know a day or two ahead that it will be late so I can make some changes. But no!!! They did not! The tracking information was in German. I wish they have it in English so I know what they are saying about my tracking. I email them again two days later about the status and they never respond back. My friend in Germany never did receive anything. I email them the second time and they did not respond back at all. Such a bad place to order your flowers. Please don't waste your money. Go somewhere else who cares. My first and last time ordering from this place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:17:07.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

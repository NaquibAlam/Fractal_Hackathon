We had to book to stay seperately from them as we are on a lower income. We used last minute who Quote: d us a decent price but the train times were not as needed. We selected to chose different train times as my daughter has to be at school the next day and had to pay an extra £28. Then when we went through and paid we receive the old train times on our booking and not selected ones. We have been on and off the phone with last minute and they are blaming us. They don't know how their website works and have been totally incompetent. We have just received an email from them stating we need to pay another £45 to change the times of our train and say the extra was booking fees that weren't clearly stated. I'm astonished that such a well known company can treat people like this and offers terrible customer service. I won't be using them again as they have put us in a hard position now for what was meant to be an enjoyable time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:53:58.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

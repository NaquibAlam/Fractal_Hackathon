He used it less than 6 times when creases started appearing in the board. I contacted them by phone and was advised to send in photos which I did. I got no response for over 3 weeks so I phoned them again as was told that I had damaged the board myself but that they would call me later in the day. They did not call me back so over a week later I emailed them again to remind them that this faulty product was under warranty to which they responded within 2 days to say they would not refund me as I had damaged it. Very poor service and no intention of upholding warranty obligations. Despite my requests for a physical location to return goods I was told that they do have a physical address but goods can not be returned there as there are no customer support personnel at those premise. I will not be using tradetested ever again and would not recommend them to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:18:15.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

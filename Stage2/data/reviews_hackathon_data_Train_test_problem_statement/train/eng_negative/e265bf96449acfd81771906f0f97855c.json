I got a Good price. My car was arranged to be picked up by a local garage between 8am and 10am. I waited until 10am but no-one turned up to collect my car. I phoned servicing stop and explained the situation. I was left on hold so that they can contact the garage. I was told that they could not get an answer, and there is nothing they can do, so leave it an hour to see if the car gets collected. I waited for an hour - still no show. Phoned servicing stop again, and was told that they still can not get in touch with the garage, their phone is just ringing out. I was informed that my case will be handed over to my service adviser, who will keep trying to contact the garage and call me back. I waited until 5pm,and had to call servicing stop again as I did not get any call back from them. They apologised and said that they have been unable to contact the garage all day and that the garage has acted in a very unprofessional manner. I was told that an adviser from servicing stop will arrange for me to call me back to re-arrange the appointment. I took the day off work especially for my car to get serviced and Mot'd, and did not want to risk this happening again, so told them that I do not want to re-book and have now arranged my service and mot elsewhere. I feel like I have had an entire day wasted, and I hope that Servicing stop, do review and discontinue using garages like the one they selected for me, as they have now lost me as a customer. I had a 5 star Review for servicing stop last year, but due to this unacceptable experience I have had to change it to 1 star.\nLast years 5 Star Review\nI booked my car in for A Full Service & Mot. I got a Good price. My car was picked up by one of the garage employees within stated time, he left his car at my home and took my car to the garage. I got a phone call from servicing check to say my car failed its MOT, and they gave me a price for the repairs. I knew that all the parts that were needing replaced were required as they were advisories on my last MOT. I agreed to get the repairs done, immediately got the online link to pay via email. Quick and easy to pay online. Car returned shortly after 6pm, slightly later than the time given, but I didn't mind as I know from experience how bad traffic is at that time. I got my service book back all stamped, with Mot Certificate and service paperwork. This is the first time I have used Servicing Check, the agents I dealt with were friendly and the service was great. I have already booked my car in for its service and MOT for next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:46:49.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

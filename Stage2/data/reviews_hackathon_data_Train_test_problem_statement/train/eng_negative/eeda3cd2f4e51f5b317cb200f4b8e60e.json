After listening to the manager says the same answer during 3 visits to the bank, transfer wise insist to say that is MY PROBLEM, and that there is NOTHING they can do. That I ( the costumer, the person who paid a high fee for their services, who paid the invoice to their company) should be dealing with the bank coz they said they have paid and the bank says the money never reach their institution.\nTHIS IS THE SITUATION IM IN TODAY.\nTransferwise blames the bank, and the bank claim to never received the money, and I lost my money so far.\nWe showed the bank account statement to proof that the money never reached our account, signed by the manager.\nAll TransferWise says is that they did the transfer, they have a identification number for the transfer ( that the bank don't recognise) and that I should solve this with the bank.\nToday is my last attempt to try to call them and try to solve this before going to the authorities and report the felony they are doing with their costumer.\nNayane Mendes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:30:36.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

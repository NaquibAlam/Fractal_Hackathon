The receptionist was friendly. The first problem was insurance. Choice between €50 for a day or leaving the car in the car park uninsured as they apparently had no staff available at 5.30 to check the car on return. I had no choice but to take the insurance. They are also strangely silent about the fuel recharge penalty of €50 - I was delayed and did not have time to fully top off the tank - I have no issue with being charged a premium of several cents for the fuels which is usual but not a flat fee of €50. The bill arrived at 7 o'clock so they did 'mysteriously' have personnel available to check the vehicle in. I am a very frequent traveller and have rented dozens of cars but have never experienced such a crude rip off as this. I am the CFO of a large company and have put Goldcar on a blacklist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:34:40.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

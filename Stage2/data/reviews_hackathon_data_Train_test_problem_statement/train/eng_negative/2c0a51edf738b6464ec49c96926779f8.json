After shipment i got a note that they could not change anything because the parcel was sent. (this note several days after purchase.) second message was that i should have wrote a note along to the order,,,WHAT,, that was excatly what i did, they just didn´t read it before after shipment. Their error and mistake, but no solution is offered, i just have to accept that because of them some items to around 100 usd will end up costing an extra 89 usd because they did not at least send the items in one parcel, but broke it up in bits so i have to pay 23 usd custom fee for each parcel.\nAt another purchace I payed like 18 usd for fast delivery. 2 days later it was shipped. now 10 days later still no update upon the tracking and this means it has still not left the origin airport. I have faster delivery from Ebay with free shipment.\nNo matter what you write to costumer service they refuse to listen to you and it is like they do not understand English at all, if you ask in east they reply in west.\nAnd bevare in Ebay you buy from different sellers and can always choose another seller, in Banggood all goes thru their service center and this way you can´t make any request to the seller direct and avoid misunderstandings.\nMy advice will forever be, if you shop from Asia online, then avoid Banggood, they are not to be trusted and their money guarantee is worthless, because Banggood is seller and judge in all complaints.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T23:50:07.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I called them in February and they said I was included in membership without notification and I didn't ask for it. I told them to cancel that and the money is no refundable. I said no problem. The problem now in March they charged me again and I called them. They said the same thing they will cancel my membership. I don't know what to do. They are steeling my money every month and I cant do any thing. I will never ever book through them again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T09:22:52.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Returned it in the same condition as we collected it. It was signed off as okay by a Goldcar Rep when it was returned. Goldcar sent an email 3 days after we returned to the UK informing us that it was taking 450€ from our credit card with photos of scratches that we had already marked on the collection document and which had been agreed to the Goldcar dispatcher.\nWhen we checked our credit card 2 days later, 735€ had been withdrawn (not 450€ as noted) with no notification. This is theft!\nM and S Mastercard has put this into dispute with Goldcar but this is a WARNING. Giving you credit card details to pay for an additional item at collection means that they can take what they like once you are gone.\nThis had never happened to us in over 10 years of renting cars in Spain and we were shocked at this outright fraud.\nWe have never had a reply from Goldcar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T22:51:50.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

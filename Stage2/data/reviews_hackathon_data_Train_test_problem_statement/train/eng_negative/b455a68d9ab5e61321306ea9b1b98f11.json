I ordered it and once i recieved it went to swap it out. Does not fit at all, completly different design. I know over time parts get improved to be better then OEM parts but this is way off. Its shorter for one, and the ends that fit into the grooves of the shoes dont fit. The short side is way to wide and the shoe can move significantly around instead of a firm hold and the longer side that the adjuster wheel screws into is a whole different style. Doesnt fit around the shoe plate or the plate behind the shoe. Very dissatisfied. Now i need to hunt for the part all over again since no part stores or dealerships carry it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T21:54:00.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

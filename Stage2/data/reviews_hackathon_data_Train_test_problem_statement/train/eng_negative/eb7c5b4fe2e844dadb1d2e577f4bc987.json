The tickets were in the front rows A, B or C, and early prices were $200.00 per seat. That was paid. The concert is scheduled for 14 February 2017. After many phone calls the tickets had not arrived by 13 February 2017. As we live on the North Coast and had to book accommodation, by that time we had lost confidence and cancelled the accommodation we had tentatively booked. Around 9:00 am on 14 February 2017 tickets for the extreme rear row arrived. These tickets had been listed at $89.00 each just days ago, on the resale site.\nA 'phone call to Ticketmaster Resale achieved nothing other than confirmation that they are a total con.\nAt this late stage, there is little we can do, except offer the tickets for resale - on guess who's site? Where they get commission on the resale. And we get to miss out on a concert which we booked premium seats for at the earliest possible opportunity!\nWhat more can I say - except to advise anybody contemplating dealing with these people to consider dealing with the devil himself in preference.\nVery bad form Ticketmaster Resale! Shame! Shame! Shame!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:22:19.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Having the worst experience with last minute & Kuwait Airways. I booked my flight to Sri Lanka last October, only to be told 6 weeks before departure that my flight had been cancelled and that there is no alternative flight and so 'the only possible option provided by the airline is a refund'.\nI put in a request for this refund 3 weeks ago and haven't seen a penny. In this time, I have also booked a brand new flight as I still need to get to Sri Lanka.\nAfter many emails asking about the status of my refund, I have today received an email telling me there IS in fact an alternative flight!!!! So now I have bought two separate flights to Sri Lanka, and don't even know if and when I will be getting any money back!!\nThey have taken up to a week to respond to my emails, so I have little faith that I will be receiving my refund before my trip, which is ¬£350 of my spending money that I won't have anymore.\nFurthermore, if I do choose to take this alternative flight with Kuwait airways and cancel my new flight I've had to book, I will be charged ¬£160 to do so. So make that ¬£510 of spending money in the bin.\nThanks for ruining my holiday before I've even got there.

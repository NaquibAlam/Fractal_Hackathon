After a week I had still received nothing, so I emailed them to ask when my order would be arriving. I was told: it normally takes ten days to Luxembourg. 10 days?? I am next door to Germany, not in Australia!\nAfter ten days the package finally arrived and I was very excited to open it until....I discovered something was wrong. Two of the items I had ordered were in the package but another item was missing (as was the Geschenk (present) they had promised me on the front of their advert). Instead of a lovely black swimsuit (Badeanzug) I had ordered, I found a huge white bra, about ten sizes bigger than my size, which I had not ordered at all.\nI did the correct thing and IMMEDIATELY wrote them an email (in English - my written German is not good enough) to explain the situation in detail, telling them exactly what I had found in the package, even giving them the brand name and code number of the item sent to me by mistake. I never actually received a reply to that email. So, thinking that maybe they didn't understand English, two days later (16th January) I called their Customer Service centre where I found a lady who spoke perfect French. So I told her in French of the problem, and asked her to please send me the swimsuit as soon as possible as I needed it to go on holiday. She agreed to send it immediately but asked me to return to her by post the white bra which had been sent to me by mistake (she did not apologise for their mistake, however). I am a very busy working person, but I did what she asked - on 17th January I went to the post office, after having bought a large envelope, inserted the white bra in the envelope with a letter in French - AGAIN explaining the situation - and stuck the Bader return sticker on the package. I patiently waited ANOTHER TEN DAYS, and nothing arrived. So, again, I sent emails to complain, and said: this time I am tired of waiting and would just like my money back immediately. But I was so irritated that I decided to call them the following day, too, and spoke to the same French-speaking lady asking her why she had not sent me the swimsuit (which I had paid for online by credit card 3 weeks earlier!). She told me she had not sent it because it was not in stock at the time, but it had miraculously just arrived and she had just posted it yesterday (after receiving my email asking for my money back, of course...). I do not believe her. She could have emailed me immediately to tell me that it was no longer in stock, but she didn't. She just left me waiting for the postman to arrive every single day for another 10 days! I think she probably just forgot. Or they were waiting to receive that horrible white bra back from me first. Their internal mailing and administrative procedures appear to be so slow that a snail would move more quickly from Luxembourg to Germany and vice-versa! It must simply be an excuse to hold on to my money for longer. However, it is certainly no way to treat customers. Dear Bader, if a customer informs you of a mistake as soon as he/she receives a package from you, you should believe them and try to make amends, not make the customer wait forever and keep them uninformed about the status of their order! If a customer tells you that something was missing from a package (because of the fault of somebody working for YOUR company)and that she would like to have that article immediately, you should a) apologise for the mistake and b) send the article IMMEDIATELY, with a small gift to apologise for the mistake. That is how you do business and keep customers. This was my first time with this company and it will definitely be the last. I have never had such awful customer service in my life. I often order from websites in England and never have any problems there. They are always very efficient. It is a pity, because there are some very interesting things in the catalogue, but I just don't trust you any more! And I'm still waiting for my money back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T19:21:11.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Heaps of interesting products. Everything is in stock until you order, then it's delayed. Not a problem, I'm patient.\nWhen goods arrive (high-end smartphone) it looks great, but it doesn't work or it works for a few minutes. Ordered several times and each time the phone was DOA (dead on arrival).\nCustomer service responds fast and in a polite way. Simply return the phone and we'll refund you. And that's it... They claim return parcels have not arrived, they don't refund your money and they stop answering your emails. Don't shop here. You'll waste your money. Go for a reliable shop in Europe or the USA and stay away from this shop.\nUpdate 22/03: After Banggood's response.... The product has been returned to Banggood according to their shipping specs. They promised a refund, just as it says in their policy as posted by them. But they never fulfilled that promise and they're not replying to emails. So I'll send a new one as requested by their repsons to this review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:14:58.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

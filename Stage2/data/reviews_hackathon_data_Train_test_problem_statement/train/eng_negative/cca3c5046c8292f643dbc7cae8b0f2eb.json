Then I was informed after sending them fourteen images that they couldn't see the costume properly and that it was too complicated to make, when, within 24 hours of making another request to another site, they confirmed they could make it, the fabric they would make it with, and have it done within my budget. Customer service was unhelpful and almost seemed automated in their responses. Go elsewhere, it's not worth the strain.\nEDIT: now they are interested in emailing me because I posted a poor review! They claimed they didn't have any materials I liked when they never offered any materials in the first place. I do not know anything about making costumes or materials, thats why I came to them, and I told them that in my first commission email. Very disappointed, and now very creeped out by the fact they think it's okay to email me about this review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T23:42:54.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

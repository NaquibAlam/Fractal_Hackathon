We called 5 hours prior to getting to our destination that we would be an hour and a half late and was told they would note that on our reservation. We were held up as were all other flights to Florida because the President was flying so everyone was late. Got to the airport transportation area and called them for pickup was told 10 minutes, over 30 minutes later someone finally showed up and he told us the vehicle had been rented because we were more than an hour late(as I said earlier every flight was late). They said they no longer had the 6 passenger vehicle, but we could rent a car(however not as cheaply as our initial rental). We needed a 6 passenger vehicle, so I told off the driver and we ended up paying twice as much as we had to find a vehicle available. Looks like if if you follow the directions they will find a way out of the deal. If it sounds too good to be true, it is, Will never rent from them anywhere.

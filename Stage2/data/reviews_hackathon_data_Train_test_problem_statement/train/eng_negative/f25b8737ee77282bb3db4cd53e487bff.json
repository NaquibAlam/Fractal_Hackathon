Tickets in the 1st row, his ONLY 14th birthday present. Was not shipped expedited on the 25th! They apologized...a measley $25 refund (not even the extra shipping cost). I now have to go early (in a snow storm) tomorrow to find a jersey. Completely unacceptable! It should be half price or free at this point. The jersey is scheduled to arrive 1/31. If shipped as I ordered, plenty of time!

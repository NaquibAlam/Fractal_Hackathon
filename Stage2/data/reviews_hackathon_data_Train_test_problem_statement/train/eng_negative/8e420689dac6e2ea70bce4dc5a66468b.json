Initial purchase - where some items were unavailable.\n2. Confirmed by phone the rest was there, reconfirmed in store this was the case. Made to sit in the loading dock (full sun on a 40 degree day) only to be told pieces were still unavailable... & that apparently my experience that day was the same as the shop assistants experience of picking up an iPhone (when he waited for 10 minutes in an air conditioned shopping centre). Told to come back on the weekend.\n3. Sunday 4pm went in as asked - told not available and that I should ring before I go to the store.\nRung Monday at 9.30am to be told the remaining parts had arrived at the store in the Friday shipment - could I come that day!\n4. Finally got the remaining parts.\nTotally frustrating experience! Will not shop at the Canberra BBG againg!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:54:40.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

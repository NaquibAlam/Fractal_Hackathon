After installation, I discovered the universal mounting bracket was interfering with the belt guard. I proceed to use the largest spacer and it still did not provide sufficient clearance. This is a obvious design flaw. I emailed Viking and they told me they will send me a \"new and improved\" bracket and it should solved the problem. The new and improved bracket did not solved the problem. It made it even worst. I email them again with photos and video explaining the problem and wanted to return the bags for a refund, The following is the reply from them.\n\"Hello, As mentioned in the previous email we do recommend you re-drill the bags into a position where the bags do not come into contact with any part of you're motorcycle. Once you have re-drilled the bags we can provide plugs for the extra set of holes needing to be drilled. A careful dry mount is instructed in all of our instructions which is shown in the attached image. That being said we do not accept return on drilled bags per our return policy. Should you have any further questions feel free to reply to this email.Have a great day. -Viking Bags Management\"\nWhat kind of company am I dealing with? Sold me a product that doesn't work due to poor design and refuse to refund my money!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T20:18:14.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

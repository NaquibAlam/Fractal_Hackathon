I should add I realized it was a no cancellation policy for this room, the page finally went blank. I thought it didn't go through, so went ahead and did it again. It went through this time, then I received two emails saying I had two rooms booked. Went in and can called the second, of course, says no refund. I spent prob two hours on the phone with four different people. First call, after being on the line with the lady trying to find the transaction forever, the call was dropped, second time, same thing, went through it all, call was dropped again, third time, got fellow named Rog, he can't find anything either, tells me to call back in an hour, must be something with their system. Fourth, talked with a lady who said I would receive an email with 24 hours. Of course no email! these people know exactly what they are doing, right down to the dropped calls....excuses of not finding the transaction....system maintenance, and then oh ya...they're going to send me an email. They had no problem getting the two room charges on my credit card exact same day!! I have just recently emailed them....will see if I get any response.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:22:51.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

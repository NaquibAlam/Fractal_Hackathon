Payment by 16-29. On this day, not been sent, although the site says that if you pay for shipping to 18-00 on the same day. The next day, I was promised that they would send, and throw off the track number, but again, not sent, it is not written in there. Send Friday. On Friday again and again only promises not sent, was moved to Monday and promised that just sent. Today writes that on Wednesday, so took 7 days from date of order, one that does not send the money and do not want to return. I was assured that was sent on Thursday, but no one sent and sending numbers they have. I will write a statement to the police about the fraud. Frauds and liars\nUPDATE\nAfter I left here for your review, I got a call from the number +3271253850. They said that money back, if I remove a review. (Conversation is recorded on tape) call was 12-35. I gave the card number for a refund and I was promised for an hour to return the money. But it was already 3:00 and nothing happens! Ie they are engaged in blackmail - daring first comment, then the money! (Also have screenshots) All correspondence stored and recorded conversations, and all this will be referred to the police and prosecutor's office. Also, I will write a letter on Google to their website blacklisted", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T20:29:35.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

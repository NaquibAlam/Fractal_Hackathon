I paid almost £90 for a flight including the cancellation package. I am receiving £14 back because \"it's up to the airline to decide whether or not I can cancel\". So basically the money I used to purchase the Cancellation package is the money I'm getting back. It is WORTHLESS. Don't even bother getting the Cancellation package.\n2) If you have a simple question and you're in a different country, you have to pay €6 for a 15 minute phone call with customer service. I had to call twice because they didn't follow up like they said they would. So I paid €12 just to ask a simple question.\n3) Every time you make this phone call, you have to re-enter all your credit card information which is really annoying. And it hangs up on you if no one answers within like 5 minutes. So you have to constantly re-enter your information. The. Worst.\nIn the end, I will have spent £87 on nothing.

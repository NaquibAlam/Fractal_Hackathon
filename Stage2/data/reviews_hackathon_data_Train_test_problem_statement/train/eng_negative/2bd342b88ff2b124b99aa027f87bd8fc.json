Travel Republic were a disaster! They sent me the confirmation email and debited my account the day I booked and so I thought happy days. However when we got to the hotel there was no booking for us, not even on Travel Republics database. Luckily the hotel staff were amazing and sorted us out despite not receiving the money I had been debited. Very disappointing service and although the price is good the reliability is just not there.

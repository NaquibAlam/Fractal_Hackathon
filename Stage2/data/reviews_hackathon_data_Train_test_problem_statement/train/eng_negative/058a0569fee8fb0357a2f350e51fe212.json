The first three were so flawless, but the fourth order arrived (patches) and they were covered in green gook and peeling. After lots of back and forth with the customer service agent and the factory, they completely re-made my order but the entire process took two months.\nFor my fifth order, I completely stopped getting email and text alerts, they forgot or uploaded incorrect samples, kept sending back samples that did not follow the edits I had requested (a very simple edit- to take out a detail) and after two months of back and forth phone calls and emails and asking them to cancel my order only to have them beg to see my order through I finally had to cancel my order after receiving yet another sample that was just COMPLETELY wrong.\nI am a textile designer by trade and daily I work with multiple companies overseas and after four years in the industry I have yet to encounter any issues as difficult as the issues I had to deal with when I used the Studio.\nUse any other company- there are so many companies that make manufactured patches in the states for a similar price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:24:42.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

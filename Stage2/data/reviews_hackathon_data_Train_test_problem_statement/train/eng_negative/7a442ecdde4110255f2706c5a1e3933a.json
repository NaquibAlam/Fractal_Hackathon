I contacted Flighthub to cancel as i found a cheaper rate, but the they said they would charge for the cancellation, so asked for a credit instead and they refused. They were willing to lose a customer and risk a bad review instead. I should have looked into flighthub more carefully before booking because I found that the BBB has over 600 complaints and that they have lost their BBB accreditation. Do not used Flighthub to book a flight as you can find cheaper flights elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T10:59:12.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

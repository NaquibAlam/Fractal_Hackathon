Kept getting generic answers from customer service who didn't seem to understand my concern. Doubts about product authenticity (Dolce & Gabbana logo on case seems just a tad different from the ones I had previously) but cannot affirm that they are not authentic.\nUPDATE\nAfter publishing this review I was sent an email with a screen cap showing the corrected measurements of the eyeglasses on the website implying they were correct all along. Anticipating this kind of situation from the start, I had already taken a screencap of the incorrect measurements with which I replied. The email the merchant says they have sent me to correct the situation offered simply a 10% discount on the next purchase, which is nothing more than the current sale the website is offering to all clients for Valentine's.

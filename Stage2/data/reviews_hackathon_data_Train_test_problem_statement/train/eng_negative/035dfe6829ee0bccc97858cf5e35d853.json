I have experience with almost all trusted seller of chrono24 in Europe. You can ask me about each of them if you have any questions about them\nThe owner of this account has lied too many times to me. Usually he starts a very friendly , and send you every day some offers by Whatsapp . After you pay it to buy a watch , he ingore his duty and don't send you any watches and usually he will send you after 1-2 month your money back . But I think recently he doesn't send money back too . Below is my experience:\n1- one time I paid for a rolex datejust 16233 with saphireglass. He didn't send me the watch on time and after 25 days , he send me a rolex datejust 16013 with plexiglass!!!! And told me sorry I didn't check the reference number ! And start to send me more offer by Whatsaap with really low prices .\n2- the second time , I saw in Chrono24 a rolex yachtmaster 16623 with 6450€ and I paid it directly to his account but he didn't send the watch and after 16 days he sent back my money .!!\n3- my last experience is : I sent 2375€ for a rolex gold band 30 day ago but he didn't send the band until now and it seems he doesn't want to send back my money !!\nPlease be careful. This man is a lier and fraud and spam .\nDon't trust to this trusted seller !\nEven he doesn't have a real shop and its address is a fake address. There are a lot of seller in chrono24 like this .\nChrono24 want his benefits not buyer happiness! And put every person as a seller or trusted seller !\nIf I want to write my bad experience with every seller in chrono24 then I should write a book !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T19:31:06.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

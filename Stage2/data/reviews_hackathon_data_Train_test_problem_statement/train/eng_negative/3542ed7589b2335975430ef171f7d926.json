They don't call, they don't even put notes on the lobby door. Once they didn't deliver and didn't even notify us for the next 2 weeks. Phone customer service is totally unhelpful. The lady on the phone didn't know if undelivered goods would be available for pick up the same evening or the next day. Instead she offered me to lodge a complaint against the driver, which I thought was weird. She said drivers are supposed to leave stickers specifying details. So I asked if they have a designated driver for a particular location or more than one driver and she didn't even know that!! What an absurd way to pass the buck and just blame the driver.\nI just hope Amazon doesn't use their carrier services. They just screw up amazon prime, big time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:07:35.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

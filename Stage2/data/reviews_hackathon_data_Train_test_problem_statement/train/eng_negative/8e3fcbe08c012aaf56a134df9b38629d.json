Loved it. I could get a live person on the phone whenever I needed. I could go in and play with the settings. And a lot of time I couldn't get it quite how I wanted it but I would call, get a live person right away, and they would fix it right on the spot. Even as I had them do it one way and then another they were always super helpful and friendly.\nSo, being pleased with the service, I decided to add more phones for my growing company. Suddenly this company that I loved went from the easy-to work-with business that I loved to what felt like another annoying phone company. The person I called to add more phones couldn't help me. If I only wanted a total of 4 phones he could help me. If I wanted more than 4 phones (I wanted 5 total) then I had to go through a different person. And I couldn't just order the phones and plug them now I have to have somebody sell me a phone system. And the pricing changed and all of the sudden got very expense. After much negotiation they finally agreed on a lower price (still more than I was paying and more than I was Quote: d on a per phone bases at first) and they sent me phones and I plugged them in.\nThat is all I wanted to do. Order more phones, plug them in, and pay the same per phone price that I was paying with with one phone. Just like I did with the first phone. Just like they told me I could do when I originally signed up. Just like I ended up doing. But in the middle they had to throw in a bunch of bureaucracy, red tape, sales crap, up-selling, price increases, and negotiation.\nThey took my experience from one of extreme happiness with them, and made it a pain. For no reason. I ended up doing exactly what I wanted they just made it a lot harder, for no reason, and more expensive.\nIf you need less than 5 phones for your company I would recommend them. If you need 5 or more then they are nothing special. Just another phone company so do what you would like.\nOne more side note, all of the people have been great to work with. David Amer has been extremely helpful. He is the person in charge of my \"Phone system\" now.\nThe people are good, the company's own unnecessary policy and bureaucracy, made my customer experience poor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:55:57.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

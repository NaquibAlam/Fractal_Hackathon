After telling them what hotel he was, giving them address and room number, also giving them my work number, cell number and his cell number, plus contacting the hotel Ava's attempted delivery to the vegas hotel instead of the Reno hotel. After numerous calls from me to them I was assured it would be delivered still that day. The next day it was still not delivered. Now fighting to get my money back. They refunded part of my transaction but took out a delivery fee. They also wanted more money to deliver although it was them who attempted delivery at the wrong hotel after I clarified address repeatedly. Never once did the driver contact us at any number left with them. I will never use them again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:13:51.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

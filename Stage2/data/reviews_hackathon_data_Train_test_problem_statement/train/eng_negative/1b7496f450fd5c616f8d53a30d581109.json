After setting my day aside for 9am to 1pm appt blocks no technician showed up, showed up later than the appt block, or showed up and left saying he couldn't do the job. It's mid March and the equipment still hasn't been installed. I have asked several times to be released from my contract so that I could separate myself from this company and use a new company who could actually install the desired equipment and serve my family's needs; but Alliance refuses to do so, demanding a $700 payment of contact balance to do so. They do not care about their customers, lock you in a contract, and wont let you out even though they give you horrible service AND rude customer service. This is a nightmare. Alliance operates like scammer loan sharks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T22:09:04.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The main reason I opted to use Optical Express, despite them being more expensive than other companies, was because lifetime aftercare was included in the price I paid for laser eye surgery.\nI had a free aftercare appointment in September 2016, where they told me I needed corrective surgery as my eyesight is poor. I require glasses or contact lenses to be able to have 20:20 vision. I did not expect this a mere 2 years after surgery, however as they were prepared to fix things and to fulfill their promise of 20:20 vision, I was happy for them to correct my vision. I decided to wait till 2017 so I could arrange the time off work to have the surgery.\nIn February 2017, I tried to arrange an appointment to begin the process of the corrective surgery, however I am now being told it will cost £50.00 to just book an appointment. Of course, I asked why, as I was promised free lifetime aftercare. After all, I paid for my eyesight to be corrected, and their surgery failed. But their reply is that aftercare is only for 12 months and if I require corrective surgery, i.e. to get the eyesight I was promised, I would have to pay for this again.\nOptical Express deny that I was ever offered lifetime care. Despite already allowing me free appointments after 12 months, and despite thousands of others having the same promises made to them. They even explained how cost-effective the surgery was as I was told I wouldn't have to pay for an eyesight test again.\nThey say it was just 12 months aftercare in my terms and conditions. I was given no copy of these term and conditions. The only document I signed was to do with potential adverse side effects. Which by the way, the first time I read these was minutes before my surgery, 4 weeks after I had already paid the £2,500 for the surgery.\nA medical procedure should never have a time frame for aftercare -- especially when you paid for the surgery on the basis that you would be looked after for life!

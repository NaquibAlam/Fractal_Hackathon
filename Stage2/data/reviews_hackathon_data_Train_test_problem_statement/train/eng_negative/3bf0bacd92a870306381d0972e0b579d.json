As soon as the kids touched them at the year end party they print/sticker on the front started to peel off into several pieces. The kids were very upset and disappointed by this award. I sent an email with a picture of the product to the company on 18th and nobody has bothered to make resolution. My customer number is 750090004 and order number was 17005184.\nI would appreciate anything that can be done to replace these items.\nThanks, Michele", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T08:38:15.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This is absolutely unacceptable behaviour. If you want to verify I am happy to do that. However to intentionally wait to ask, until I send money and then delay my transfer by one week is borderline harassment. Why can you not ask for this information before or after an active transfer?\nBut it gets better, after the Christmas break I tried to log in and noticed my information was not being recognised. I called up customer service who stated she did not know what it is, possibly a technical error and advised me to send an email to their appeals team.\nI emailed the appeals team stating that I could not log in and whether they knew the reason for it. I then got this response:\n\"Your appeal has been reviewed and our response in this matter remains the same. Your TransferWise account has been deactivated and we will not be able to process any further payments to/from your account.\"\nThis was my first email and I was not appealing, I did not even know my account was closed. So at one point TW decided to close my account and did not bother to notify me in advance, during, or after the deed that it was done. Also they refuse until this day to explain why they did it and their behaviour in this instance is on par with PayPal that has a rating of 1.5 on this website. To round it all up I was then finally given the template T&C answer:\n\"Please keep in mind this is our final response in this matter.\nIf you are not satisfied with the response you have the right to forward it to the Financial Ombudsman service in the following 6 months latest by the 12th of July 2017.\"\nIf TW would not try to make themselves out as a honest broker that cares about consumers and consumer rights and advocates on Facebook for citizens to get involved I would have said, never mind, just another blood sucker, but the fact that they pretend to be this righteous pro-consumer organisation really bugs me.\nUntil this day TW has not responded or explained why my account was closed, I also still do not know when this was done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:36:16.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

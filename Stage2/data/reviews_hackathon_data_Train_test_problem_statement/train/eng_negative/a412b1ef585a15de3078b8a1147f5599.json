I NEEDED the micro usb 2.0 port that is a piece inside of the tablet to be able to charge. What I got was the power adapter aka the charging cube and was charged almost $40 and almost charged a second time! I called the same day and was on the phone being transferred and disconnected for over 6 hours trying to stop the part from being shipped since they didn't order the correct one. That was on 3/2/2017. Here we are 5 days later and I have yet to talk to someone about getting a refund or anything. I sent the package back today along with a letter to the company and if I am not refunded by 3/31/2017, I will be having my boss handle this directly. My bank can't do anything about it either due the the fact I have no documentation about return and can't speak to anyone about a refund. NEVER BUYING HP PRODUCT AGAIN!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T17:18:43.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

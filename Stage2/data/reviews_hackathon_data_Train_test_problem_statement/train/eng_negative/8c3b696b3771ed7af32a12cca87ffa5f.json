Paid for Express shipping that was supposed to bring me a package at my door on monday (4 days ago). Delivery guy \"came\" on tuesday, and according to the tracking, \"delivery attempted, recipient not home\" while i was TOTALLY home. No one rang or knocked! Then i called DHL customer service, filed a complaint and said that no one even rang! The lady told me delivery guy is going to come back the day after. So the day after, super ready, around the same time as the \"delivery\" from the day before, I stand on my door, waiting. Then after a couple refresh of the tracking page, same thing! \"delivery attempted, recipient not home\"! Not even a truck in front! NOTHING! Not even a delivery paper! NOTHING!!! Then i called back, filed a complaint, to be told \"we're gonna call you back in 2 hours there's nothing we can do\". Of course no one called me back! And of course no one even answered to my email! So now, my package is \"on hold\" and I have to go pick it up cus obviously I \"wasn't home\" so now it's my fault and even if I paid to get a package at my door I have to go get it, right? And not even to the closest DHL post office no, the one at the complete other end of Montreal, when there's one literally 5 min away from my place! How AMAZING is this customer service??? Never been so much disrespected and FOOLED by a company. Never ever EVER using DHL again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T08:29:55.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

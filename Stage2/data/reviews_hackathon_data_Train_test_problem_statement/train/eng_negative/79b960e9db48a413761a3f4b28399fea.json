However i rate my recent experience with them as the worst service I ever received from a service provider.\nPhoneindia's Ireland access number is down for more than 1 week now. They have not taken any measure to restore the service yet. When support team is contacted, they have no clue when the service will be restored. Support team says \"We don't have any time-frame to resolve the issue\".\nWhile I am writing this I have total 748 minutes from my monthly plan which will expire in 2 week time and â‚¬1.77 in main balance. I have discontinued my monthly plan and don't think that I I will ever recommend anyone to Phoneindia. They don't value loyalty.\nToday I am suffering. Tomorrow,the same thing can happen to you.\nPlease be aware and use your concise before deciding to use service of Phoneindia.com.\nGood Luck!\nYours Sincerely\nSamir Suin", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:28:37.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I tried to call 24.se but their phone assistance is available randomly, on that day, for example, it was simply closed. I sent them an email explaining the issue and received a reply next day to send the package back with the supplied return number. I did as instructed; after a week nothing happened, so I called again and the guy said it usually takes a week for them to process return requests and claimed that they would send it during that week (didn't happen). Two weeks after I've sent the package back, I called again and it turns out that they simply did not have the model I ordered and that I would have to wait until April 7! Given that my work is computer-based waiting for a battery for 2 months is unacceptable. I wonder why the costumer service did not tell me immediately about this issue.

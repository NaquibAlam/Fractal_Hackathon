It's light weight, has rings for hole-punched music, and elastic bands for folded page music. It has nice little straps that prevent the folder from opening to wide, with buttons for two width settings. So, it's a good design.\nBut it broke the first time I used it. Not anything really critical. It was the grommet on the strap that holds the folder open. I guess it just didn't have enough solder on it or something. Now unfortunately, half of the grommet fell into some sort of rip in the space-time continuum, so I couldn't bring it home to repair with my own solder gun.\nDo I need that strap? Probably not. But every time I use the folder I can't help but think that it's not quite as good as it should be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T19:14:48.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

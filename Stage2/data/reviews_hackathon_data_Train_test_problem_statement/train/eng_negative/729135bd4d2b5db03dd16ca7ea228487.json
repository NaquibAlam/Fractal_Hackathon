I called last week and they tested the battery on my iPad and said I needed a new battery. Made an appointment to drive an hour and a half to get the battery replaced only to find out they didn't replace a battery they gave you a whole new iPad which of course they did not have in stock because they did not communicate to the store the situation. So today I get an email that the replacement part is in stock and to come back to the store. Spent 45 min just trying to get another reservation and hopefully when I go next week on my hour and a half jaunt that they will get this taken care of. Not one time did anybody explain that your iPad needed to be fully backed up because you're just going to get a new one and it's up to you to get everything set up again. Just basic details that they should communicate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T23:43:54.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

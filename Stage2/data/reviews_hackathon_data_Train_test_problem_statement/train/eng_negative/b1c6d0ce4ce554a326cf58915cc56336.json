Then I tried to register and set, then reset password and paste conf into browser, three times. and it didn't work. So I gave up trying to Login as a frequent user and just made a hotel reservation. I found nowhere to enter my AAA status anymore. I also had to call the hotel to request a \"Feather Free\" room since both my wife and I are allergic to down feathers. So a BAD EXPERIENCE registering at a hotel we have used many times and will use many times again since my son lives close by.\n: (\n: (\n: (", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:54:37.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

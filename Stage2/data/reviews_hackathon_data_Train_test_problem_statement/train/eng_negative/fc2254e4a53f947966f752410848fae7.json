Your best bet is to purchase through PayPal who guarantees your money refunded if they rule in your favor. (I’ve been asked to detail precise information for this review)\nWe purchased two articles of clothing on Dec. 13, 2016. We received confirmation from DressLily on Dec. 18, 2016. Their email to us clearly states in red letters “FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE”. They gave us a tracking number for China Post surface mail and stated it should take 10-25 business days to arrive, and that after 24-48 hours the tracking information would be updated on the website.\nTheir tracking number showed that the garments arrived in U.S. Customs on December 25, 2016. I don’t know of ANY post office or shipping outfit that is open on Christmas Day. I never received any other tracking numbers, even after numerous attempts to contact them asking for a U.S. tracking number (Jan. 10, 2017, they advised “customs, remote locations, peak shipping periods…could impact the shipping company”. Again the tracking number never changed from the Dec. 25th arrival in to U.S. Customs. They advised us to contact our post office and that “your delivery deadline will expire on Feb. 19, 2017. Once we receive all details above, we will offer you a solution for your case”.\nI emailed them again stating the post office had nothing and there was no change in shipping information since Dec. 25th, and would you PLEASE send us a U.S. tracking number. They again reminded me how “delivery time may also be affected by extenuating circumstances such as \"extreme weather conditions, national holidays and peak delivery seasons…your order has been shipped out on 12/19/2016, therefore your delivery deadline will expire on 2/19/2017…contact us after that date and we will offer you a solution”.\nTHEIR WEBSITE BLOCKED US: My numerous contacts to them (Dec. 28, 2016 twice, Jan. 9, 1718, and 20, 2017 twice). The latter email to them advised that when we logged in to their website we were advised the ‘code is wrong’. The second attempt we got a pop-up that said ‘question not found’ and it jammed up our computer requiring us to completely log out of their page. The 3rd attempt to login from their link completely closed the page again, a pop-up box again said “question not found”. I again explained the post office had nothing from them or for us, so I asked for a refund of all monies.\nAnother email to them and their response was: “After reviewing your order in detail, we have found that you haven’t purchased any insurance during the check-out”. They offered if I sent them the items (which I never received) they offered to reimburse us $13.54 “as a gesture of good will”.\nThat’s when I contacted PayPal’s Disputes. They ruled in our favor and have given us a full refund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T18:53:56.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

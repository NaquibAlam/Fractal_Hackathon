As a new member I put in the promo code to get the $20 discount on membership , it stated I would pay $79.00 and the site would then not let me confirm the membership or order. So, I went back in and had to pay the full $99 before it would confirm my membership. Now, I tried to download forms I ordered but I did not get the download (and you have charged my credit card). Very disappointing.

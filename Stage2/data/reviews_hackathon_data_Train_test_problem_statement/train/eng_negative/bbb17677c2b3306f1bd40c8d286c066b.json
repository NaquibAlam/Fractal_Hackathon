The order was placed 3 days before. It seems inadmissible that the delivery commitment of FloraQueen is not kept while I also asked the person to stay at home! No call and no passing notice!\nConsidering the price of the service (64 â‚¬) your service is deplorable! Thank you for counting on you to mark an important moment and ultimately disappoint the person! Thanks to FloraQueen for having me miss a way to mark 8 years of common life.\nIt was answered by email that they will TRY to deliver the flowers on 8/03/2017! I said try. No financial compensation envisaged. You are the perfect example of these pseudo respectful companies that rip off customers without remorse!\nIn conclusion :\n- No respect for the customer.\n- No compliance with the delivery date.\n- Abusive price considering the service.\n- Phantom Phone Platform! After 5 minutes without answer you are hung up in the nose.\n- You can count on them not to deliver the flowers on time.\n- You can go through them to send flowers to people you do not like.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T21:58:59.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

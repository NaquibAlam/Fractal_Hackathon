I placed a telephone order for flowers for $59.99, but my credit card was charged $97.90. There were added charges for same day delivery, greeting card, ribbon, etc. which were not discussed on the phone. Totally misleading. Customer service was polite but unaccommodating. Don't use Ava's. Use your local florist instead. Beware of calling an 800 number for flowers.

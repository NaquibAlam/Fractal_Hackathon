I explained to him that we were only given a sales receipt and he then told us we had to go to the store (which was a good distance away) and get the neccessary document. He then rudely moved to the next person. When we arrived in the store, the associate that provided the pick-up document stated that we did not have to walk all the way there to get it, that he could've just called them from the loading area. Of course this upset me since we were just pushed aside so that the loading dock assiciate could just get to the next person as soon as possible. When we arrived back around to the loading dock, we had to wait an additional 30-40 minutes for the other customers to get all of their things and leave. We were in a bit of a time crunch to return our rental truck and this cost us alot of time. I think this situation can be avoided if Home Zone provides a bit more customer service training.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:35:00.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

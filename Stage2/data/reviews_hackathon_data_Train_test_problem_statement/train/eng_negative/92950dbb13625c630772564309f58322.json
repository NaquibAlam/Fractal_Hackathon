They advertise \"no hassle returns\" but don't follow thru. I contacted customer service via online chat & was told IN WRITING that I could return an activity tracker that was a gift, without a receipt - no problem. Wrong! The store said that they do things differently online, but the stores cannot accept returns of electronics without a receipt. I contacted corporate & was told the employee was misinformed & would be \"counseled\", and that I was out of luck. No more Kohl's for me - there's plenty of other businesses out there that will be more than happy to accept my money. Their prices are ridiculous anyway unless you have coupons or their silly Kohl's Cash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:34:41.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They lead us to believe it would be a 1-2 night trip, but her ordeal took her through Utah, Colorado & Kansas, taking 7 days, while we were strung along by Erica with promised ETA's within 24 hours. We went from okay, to panicked, to terrified for our pet, and then felt like payment-scheme victims as they got our credit card info, asked for cashier's checks, Moneygram payments to 3rd parties, and finally made us set up and pay with a 'Venmo' account with no recourse. Then Erica's time frames for our dog's delivery got vaguer and vaguer. We agonized through the whole ordeal, worried sick about our pet. She finally arrived, pee soaked and out of food. We will never use this service again, and are reporting CitizenShipper.com and Alpha-Omega to the Better Business Bureau and the Department of Transportation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T12:02:50.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was a very long and laborious job but I wanted to ensure each one worked so as not to get anything rejected.\nMuch to my surprise a few days later I received notification that 9 of the CD's (10%) were rejected due to 'damage'.\nI queried this with the customer services team as know 100% that they were all in full working order (a number of them were brand new or hardly played). I also packaged up very carefully so there was no possibility of damage during transit.\nAfter contacting the customer service team a number of times I have gotten nowhere. They can't even be bothered to write a proper response, instead using a generic 'copy and paste' replies stating their T'c and C's.\nI asked for the CD's to be re-checked but they have been disposed of apparently (very convenient).\nI feel completely cheated and ripped off and having read reviews on other sites it appears this happens to a lot of people.\nI would not recommend ziffit", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:45:36.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

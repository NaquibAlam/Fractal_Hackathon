There's only transparancy in Travelgenio's costs after it's too late and not even then.\nDuring the booking it is never stated that check-in luguage is may not be included in the booking. Moreover, I thought I booked special luggage, sporting gear. I had to find out afterwards, I only booked 'handling fees' or 'management fees' and not the actual special luggage itself. Finally I had to pay 120€ on top of my ticket. 60 for the checkl-in luguage, 60 for the sporting gear, both ways.\nA travel companion of mine booked the same flight with the same sporting gear, but he had to pay 35€ for the gear instead of the 30 I had to pay. He phoned them and try to explain that this was a case of arbitrariness and demanded to pay the same amount as me. There was no way he could make them understand.\nI complained about the whole thing, stating that I would be more careful next time, booking with an intermediary.\nTravelgenio's Cristina laughed right in my face replying: 'Thank you very much for trusting Travelgenio!'\nEdit: I'm pretty sure half of the positive reviews for Travelgenio on this site are fake. Please note how only reviews with a good rating get the 'verified order' sign. Could it be that it is no coïncidence that only happy customers are invited by Travelgenio to write a review? I provided Trustpilot with my booking details, but no 'verified order'.

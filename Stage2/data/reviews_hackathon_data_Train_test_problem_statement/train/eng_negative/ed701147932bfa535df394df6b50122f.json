When I picked it up the warehouse guy would not hand me the box and carried it all the way to my car and set it in the trunk. I thought this was strange since it was the size of a shoebox, why he wouldn't just hand it to me. I signed and went home. When I got home I went to pick up the box and as I barely touched it you could hear it was completely shattered. There is no way anyone in contact with this box would not know this. I understand that broken items happen but my problem is why the warehouse couldn't just say, \"hey this is broken\" and go from there. They purposely gave me a broken one. Well I drove back to the store and returned it for a refund. What a waste of my time. My advice: always check your boxes before signing. Lesson learned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:26:25.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

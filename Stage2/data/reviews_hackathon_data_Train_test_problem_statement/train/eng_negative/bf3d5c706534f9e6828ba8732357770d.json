I wanted to enter the Visa checkout program, but repeatedly got an error message telling me that there was an error with my information. I was not given an error code or any other details, and when I re-checked my data each time, everything was correct. I had to enter the exact same data 6 times and finally, I skipped the Visa part of the checkout and proceeded directly to regular checkout. It worked fine, but I still have no idea how to check out with the Visa option. Further, it was unclear how to become a VIP member. There are no directions and no sign up specifics; I believe you automatically get enrolled, but I have no idea. This site has nice clothing - I'll have to see the items when I get them to see the quality - but the specifics of the transactions are HORRIBLE! There are no details or no explanations as to how to deal with anything required!!! I am now in a horrible mood, having had to wrestle with this site!!! Had I not been purchasing a gift, I would have just given up and stopped dealing with this site!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T04:32:52.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

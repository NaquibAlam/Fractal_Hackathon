This review is in regards to the 7000 Silver Series Polyurethane ESD Chairs we purchased. We purchased 14 chairs total. 2 chairs were rushed before the holidays and arrived with aluminum polish all over the cast aluminum bases. Ok, rushed order I thought, I complained and cleaned them up for our cleanroom facility. I was promised by PAC this wouldn't happen again for the rest of the 12 chairs. When the 12 other chairs arrived some (just shy of half) were just as dirty and the rest were what I would expect to have to wipe off. Beware of product cleanliness, if you can't afford to put in your own effort to clean the chairs don't buy.\nThere was no provision for cleanroom packaging what-so-ever, the cleaner chairs I received had less polishing compound but still had residues of polishing compound on the under, rough cast side that I cleaned off laboriously.\nI will change stars back to 3 if a reply to this states what the supplier is going to do to improve the state of the chairs. I don't believe they have the equipment because why wouldn't they have used it on my order or hold it up until the equipment was available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T20:38:10.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

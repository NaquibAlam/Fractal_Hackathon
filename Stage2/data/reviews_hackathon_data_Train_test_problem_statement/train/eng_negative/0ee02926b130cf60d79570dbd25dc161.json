I would have ended up paying â‚¬165 more...\nHad a similar story with Liberty Insurance (their price going up & down). I guess if you don't do proper research & ask questions, you end up overpaying for insurance regardless of which company you choose\nI would give 4 stars for value & 1 start for transparency & customer support),", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:58:23.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

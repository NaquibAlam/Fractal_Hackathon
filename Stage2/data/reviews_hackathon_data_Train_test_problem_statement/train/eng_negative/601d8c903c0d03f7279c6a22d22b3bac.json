The part I ordered was marked and stated it was for my application. However, when it arrived, it clearly did not fit. Somehow they shipped the wrong part. When I contacted them to return the part, all went well until it came to shipping. They refused to pay for the shipping. If it had been my fault, I would not have questioned it. When it is the vendor's fault, they should do the right thing. They finally just stopped communicating with me. I have told all my friends to use another vendor.

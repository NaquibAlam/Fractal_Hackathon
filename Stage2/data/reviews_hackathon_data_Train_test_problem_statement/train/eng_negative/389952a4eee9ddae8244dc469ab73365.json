I booked and paid for accommodation only to be told a week later that the accommodation provider didn't have any space and that there was no where to stay in any other hotel or motel because everything was booked out for the festival. I chose Agoda and this accommodation provider over others but by the time\nthey told me they had made a mistake there was no accomodation left within 60 km of my destination. They offered a refund but said it would take up to 30 days to process the refund. So they take your money straight away but then can't give it back for 30 days. You can't ring them you have to communicate by email and every time you send an email someone different replies and just cuts and pastes their replies. With the same pathetic robotic apology which is so insincere it's actually quite funny. Never again Agoda.

When I went to wrap it wrong size pants had been sent. I rang customer help line but as it was a Saturday not open. Rang nearest shop in Galway to see if hey had right size. They did not. They said they could order it in , so I requested they do so. They said they couldn't do it over the phone and I would have to go in. I would have to pay for new ones and they would do a refund on the original ones but it could take three days to be refunded to the card! I told him this was crazy. He said I was better off ordering to home address but as I explained the one item on its own didn't qualify for free delivery. So I would have to pay 4 Euro delivery for their mistake. He said I should wait till Monday and contact customer services. I explained it was my sons birthday the next day, and surely he could order the correct pants over the phone with my card number. However he said I had to be in the shop to order ! At this point I gave up rang Elverys to see if they had it . They did and put it aside for me. Went to Elverys got pants and was able to give to son for birthday. Very poor systems and customer service. No help if it's the weekend. Can't believe I couldn't do exchange over the phone and would have to pay again and then claim a refund. A very poor and frustrating experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:47:28.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

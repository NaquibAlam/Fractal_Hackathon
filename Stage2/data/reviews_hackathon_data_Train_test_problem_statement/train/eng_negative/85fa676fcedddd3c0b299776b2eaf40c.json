When I chose my flight with my friend the ticket was for $280 so we booked it very fast because it seems to be the cheapest flight we found. When we confirm the flight for $280 we got a bill of $390. I called the costumer service and they couldn't even help even if they knew that they made a mistake they didn't even really care for my problem. They told me that I have to options: I could cancel this flight and still needed to pay $75 and should book again the same flight for $315. This didnt made sense for me so by the end I should pay more than I actually already did. And by the way the costumer service didn't tell me at the beginning that I would need to pay for the cancelation after I asked a lot of times he told me the price. There are a lot of hidden prices they don't tell you about! And my other option was just to take my flight. This is the last time for me and my friends booking a flight on flighthub, we were about to book the hotel and to rent a car on flighthub too, but not after all of this! You can NOT trust flighthub\nThe guy told me that it's a mistake from the airline that i booked so I should call delta airline. Even the guy from delta airline couldn't believe how this guy from flighthub workes and that it's definetly a mistake from flighthub since I booked the flight from theire homepage. I can't believe that you guys can't even help your costumer after you made mistakes and trying to tell me that it would be the fault of someone else!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:59:40.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

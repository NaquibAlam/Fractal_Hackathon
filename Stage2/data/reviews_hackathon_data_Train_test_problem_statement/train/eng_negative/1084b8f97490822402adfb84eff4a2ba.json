When I called, the customer service agent was very rude and told me that they don't access apartment buildings if the receiver is not at home. I told him that I waited all day for my delivery and that nobody showed up and even if the delivery man couldn't access my building, they could have done what every shipping company does and leave a card with the instructions to get my package (By the way, I previously received a package delivered by Purolator and they left a card doswnstairs in my building, so this is not new for them). When I told him that, the agent was even ruder and told me that this is their policy and that they don't access apartments buildings...Obviously lying... He aggressively offered to put my package on hold at a local Purolator store which I accepted thinking that it will be easier to finally get my products but, today it's Thursday and still no call from them... I am very disappointed and frustrated by this situation and I hope that I will not have to deal with this company again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:19:49.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

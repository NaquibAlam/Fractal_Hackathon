Emailed them twice before I received a response. Was then asked to take a photo of the wrong item sent and email it to them before they would advise me on the next steps. The next day received an email asking me to courier the item back to them BEFORE they would send out the original item I'd ordered and already paid for! I emailed saying I would post the item back but found it unacceptable that I would be made to wait for my original item to be sent to me until they had received it, due to their error. I didn't receive a reply. 11 days since my order and it STILL hasn't been resolved. Shocking customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:21:12.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

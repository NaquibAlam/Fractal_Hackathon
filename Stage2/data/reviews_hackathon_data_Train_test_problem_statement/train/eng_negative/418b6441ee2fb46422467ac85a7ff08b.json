Ordered some light bulbs, based on shipping of 1-3 days. What they didnt say was the items would be shipped from China, so I think the 1-3 days was tie to dispatch - goodness knows how long they will take to arrive. I was then slapped with a £30 import fee from DHL (The order was only for £107). So I mailed to cancel the order, before it left China. To be told to pay the fee, send them the invoice and they would refund it against some insurance policy. I said I wanted to cancel and get a full refund, to which they will only offer back £88. I believe this is illegal under distance selling regulations so am going to contact my bank to get the transaction refunded that way. A very suspicious company!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T18:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T17:55:20.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

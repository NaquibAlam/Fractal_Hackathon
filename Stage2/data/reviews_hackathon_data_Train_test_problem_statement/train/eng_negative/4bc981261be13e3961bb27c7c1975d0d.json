At this point we were told we needed snow chains or 4 wheel drive and offered an upgrade to an automatic car with GPS.\nThe car we were given was manual and the GPS didn't work which meant we got stuck in traffic in Geneva for 1 1/2h hours. When we complained at the Budget desk we were told we should have come back (which would have added another 1 1/2h to our journey. They then said in the 10 minutes it took us to get from the car to the helpdesk that they had tested the GPD and all was well. When we complained again we were told by the desk manager to send an email.\nDone that and offered 10% off my next booking. Not particularly helpful customer services and massive con.

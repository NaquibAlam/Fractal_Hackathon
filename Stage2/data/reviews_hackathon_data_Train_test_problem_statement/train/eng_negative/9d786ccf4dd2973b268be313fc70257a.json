It is now 2/4/17 and my friend's husband inform that she might be release to return home today. I called Ava customer services and they asked if I want to put my ordered on hold until Monday (2/6/17) to have it send to her address. I regret. REGRET EVER ORDERING HERE. I wished I ordered somewhere else. Plus! The man I was taking to was rude and he didn't transfer me to do the 30 second survey at the end. He just put me on hold and disconnected the call after I waited on the phone for a minute. He didn't care about my order. If he does not care then don't waste your money with Ava flower delivery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:56:30.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

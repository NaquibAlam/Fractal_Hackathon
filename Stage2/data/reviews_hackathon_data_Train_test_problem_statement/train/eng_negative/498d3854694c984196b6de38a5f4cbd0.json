The transaction shows as processed on both my Paypal and credit card account. Play Asia are refusing to send me my code as they say it isn't showing as paid by their account team.\nI've opened a dispute on Paypal and contacted Play Asia via their dispute option on there but they have failed to respond.\nIt's a joke and I'm half expecting the generic reply on here of 'Sorry about this. If we can have your reference number we'll look into the problem for you'. I've already given them all the relevant information COUNTLESS TIMES and they're just ignoring my emails, and messages via their website's support contact form.\nDo yourself a favour...order from another online supplier and save yourself the potential hassle of dealing with these crooks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T15:08:25.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

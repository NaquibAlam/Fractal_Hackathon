I was talked into having a closed site where I could review my designs on their site but without the public seeing it.\nIt ended up as a public spot where my design where incorporated with thousands of thousand rip of copies, bad design, lousy handiworks etc. etc. Of course I asked them to remove my site since I never gave them permission to post it.\nAfter that they continued to add my copyrighted pictures and designs to their site with no contact information or permission to me, i sent several mails asking them to remove them but it wasn’t until I threthed with legal measurement that they actually removed them.\nIf you are a designer and want your stuff to be seen with other crap on a site that definitely doesn’t care about you, please be their customer.\nHouzz is a pyramid scheme amongst young salespersons and the company does not take any responsibility.

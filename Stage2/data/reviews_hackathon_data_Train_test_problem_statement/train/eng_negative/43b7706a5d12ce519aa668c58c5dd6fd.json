Not even pick up the phone to contact the company that was supposed to deliver it. They just arrange the delivery and wash their hands if anything goes wrong.\nThe package was returned without even contacting me and now they want to charge me for the return as well. So at the end, I will have to pay double without any service received and this would have been sorted out just with one phone call/email/etc but they DO NOT provide any support after you paid.

The product was displayed as providing both a lock and a chain and I thought it represented good value. I paid the money and the parcel duly arrived only to contain a chain. I complained that they had advertised both a lock and a chain. They pointed me to another page advertising just a lock with a price of over Â£80.00. I consider the product to have been mis sold and am currently pursuing this company with UK Trading Standards. I've attached the advert so anyone can make their own minds up. Even the Oxford card on the advert states \"Chain and lock\". After my latest e-mail about this I'm being told that if I want to return the chain I will have to pay for any delivery costs. Not a good way to treat a previously loyal customer. I will never use this company again and will do my very best to let as many people know as possible about the way they do business.

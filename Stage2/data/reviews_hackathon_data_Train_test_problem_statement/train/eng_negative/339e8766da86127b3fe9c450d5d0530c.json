The delivery came anyways. Called the store spoke to a manager twice two different days and the second delivery came again when no one was home. The company blamed it on us, even after they were told on the phone to a person, a message was left, and responded to the email that no one would be available at that time. We needed a delivery for after 3:30pm. The final conversation led to a ridiculous conversation that said our delivery time of 3:30 was considered and evening delivery, of which we were NEVER offered. I will never by furniture from Gardner-White again. The delivery department is very unprofessional and discourteous. They should have offered the evening delivery time after being told the availability time. Even the driver had harsh words with us regarding the failed deliveries. Not good Gardner-White.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:28:52.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

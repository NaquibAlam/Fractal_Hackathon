I had a great experience with other companies, such as Muscle Chef (they were amazing)... but Muscle Meals Direct meals for vegetarians and Vegans are sub par and disappointing.\nProtein is obviously important for health reasons and being a vege we just get our protein from different sources, it doesn't mean we don't need protein.\nThe meal quality from muscle meals direct is poor. As an example, my Tofu Thai green curry had one tiny piece of tofu, a piece of broccoli and a couple slices of carrots; and all meals are generally the same. I have photos but I cannot upload here.\nI contacted Muscle Meals direct to try and resolve my concerns as I had spent a bit of money on 18 meals and if i continued eating these, I would get sick from a lack of protein source. They first simply offered me 10% off my next order....\nwhen I complained further they did refund $40.55 towards my meals, it doesn't quite cut it for future orders people may place, hence my review.\nWhilst it is great they are trying to offer Vege and Vegan meals, and I understand this market can be quite different, the experience is just not good enough and I wont be ordering again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:44:14.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I bought expensive resale seats for AO Section 2 -18 LOW and although I agree the tickets I received were \"in this section\", they were not LOW but were Row Z last row at the very back of the section, as far away as possible in Section 2. If the Ticketmaster system had let me see the actual seat locations BEFORE I paid for them I would have not purchased these seats and I would looked in a different area.\nI think it is sneaky and unfair to customers to stop them from seeing actually what they are paying an inflated price for until after they pay!\nNot happy, seats were not as expected. I will not use Ticketmaster again - there are lots of other online rebuy sites!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:23:02.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I called customer service for technical support, neither one of the employees who answered the call were helpful. They both claimed that they were not able to assist me which is a lie. It was so upsetting because I spent my Saturday afternoon managing through this course and just because the system randomly could not validate my voice through the voice tester, I had to return to the very beginning of the program which does not make any sense. I paid for this course thinking that it would be more convenient than going to an actual classroom-based class, but this course, particularly \"I Drive Safely\" online course has been a headache and a waste of time and money. I would not recommend this company's course to anyone. The customer support team could have been way more helpful on this experience than the little that they did or did not do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T23:02:32.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

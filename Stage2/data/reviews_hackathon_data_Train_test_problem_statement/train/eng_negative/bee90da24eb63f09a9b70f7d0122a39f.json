They can't even read a normal PDF, or so they say. They also want the original documentation sent by surface mail to Brazil from abroad. Everyone who has knowledge of Brazil knows that there is about a 50% chance that those documents will never make it unless you shell out 100 USD for a DHL/Fedex package. And if the paperwork arrive, it will take about 2-3 months to get there. We have not yet received enough information to even send the papers yet, after 3 months! Paying much more for the Worldnomads.com service is worth if you can claim online and the underwriter is reliable, but Zurich Brazil is a joke. We contacted Worldnomads for help, but they do not reply!\nLong version: A copy of the email we sent to Worldnomads:\nHi World Nomads.\nI have a complaint. We feel fooled by the product you have sold us, and I understand that we are not the only ones, given that you instead of receiving questions from Brazilian nationals to your email address​ have chosen to instead give the email address to your insurance partner Zurich in Brazil. They do a really terrible job.\nWe have now tried for several months to present a claim to them, but the communication is impossible, they claim they haven't received emails even when they have already answered them and proven they have received them. They claim that perfectly fine PDF files are not readable and filled in with the data I can see on our own computers, they send us canned email replies that do not at all correspond to our claim, and they do not keep their promises to send us info when we have talked to them many times by phone.\nSo what to do now? Contact Zurich in Switzerland? Can you help? We are out travelling and don't have time for bureacraZy the Brazilian way.\nPolicy: [redacted] • Issued: 14 Oct 2016 2:18 AM (BR-T) Holder: [redacted]\nThe price was ​well over 700 euros so we kind of expected some value.​\n[Policy holder name] does not have a bank account​ in Brazil, so she can't receive the refund​,​ and does not have any documents of residence in her name in Brazil (which they seem to require). Zurich creates all kinds of hurdles for us​ along the way​ in order to try to not refund to the person who paid the medical expenses in her name.​ ​​We have filled in all the paperwork​, including an authorization to have the refund sent to my account,​ and emailed it to them three times (!).\nThey claim that we should send the originals by postal mail, but postal mail to Brazil takes 2-3 months​​ and most of the time never makes it​. We can't wait for 6 months total for a refund and pay 150 dollars for a​ ​Fedex​ package to send the originals.​ Which is more than the claim itself. I have used Worldnomads for years and I have never been asked to send anything by surface mail.\n​I hope you're able to help us out, maybe you could push a button or two with Zurich to get this solved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T14:18:03.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The booking is confirmed by CheapOair. This is an exact confirmation with an exact CheapOair boking Number and an exact airline confirmation number too. I can not retreive my booking on the airline's website (Virgin Australia) neither by theier confirmation number nor by flight and travellers detailes. It seems this booking has lost somewhere. I can manage my booking on CheapOair website but neither here, nor on theier confirmation it is not mentioned, how many cabin and check in baggage are included or not included in the price. Instead of an exact information, they say that there are different policies on different flights and different ticket types, so one must look it at the general rules of the airline. The problem is that the confirmation does not show the type of the ticket, and when I askt it from CheapOair they said a ticket type that was unknown by the airline.\nI just hope, that at check in counter they will find my booking and I can carry the ususal baggages without any extra fee.\nAll this would be much easier if I could manage my boking directly on the airline's website, and CheapOair would show such important information on their confirmation like ticket type and what baggages included or not included in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:39:27.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Purchasing the bed wasnt the issue it was the bed frame. I had specifically told the rep i wanted the best frame to support my bed since it was over a grand in price! I was assured what i was sold was, he even showed me the one i allegedly bought. Get it home and id been sold the cheap rinky dink frame! So next morning i call and speak to an assistant manager who tells me i cannot return the one his rep incorrectly sold me but i could drive the TWO hrs back to the store and pay the upcharge for the better one that i had firmly requested the day id been in their store. Being treated like i didnt matter i decided to reach out to the regional manaher.If it werent for Dean i wouldnt ever shop there again, luckily he did make things right for his reps mistake. But overall these stores need a change in reps, this ia the second time ive shopped there and the second time ive had to get a regional manager involved. Not sure if i plan to wager spending my time with this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:10:47.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

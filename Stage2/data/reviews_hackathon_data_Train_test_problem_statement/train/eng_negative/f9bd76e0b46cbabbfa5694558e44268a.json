Me and my friends didnt hesitate because we are decided to go there. Unfortunately, there is a snow storm coming and we received a lots of warning that this storm is really bad and it says there that around 8feet of snow will go down from a day and road will be impossible to use. So we decided to try to cancel it. The property owner told us that we can cancel due to bad weather condition but they cant cancel it for us because we made the reservation through tripadvisor. So we called them and they told us that they will contact the property owner and call us back after they talk to them. The calling back and forth started at 8am until 8pm because the tripadvisor customer service keep lying to us. Telling us they will contact the property owner but they never did for first 4 calls. One excuses tripadvisor customer service says that the property owner doesn't answer but we called them and they said they never called them and even didnt leave voice mail. Tripadvisor cust. Serv. Told us too that we cannot cancel because the property owner doesn't want to but we called the property owner first and they told us we can. 10:30am tripadvisor told us their computer is not working, have to wait for 30 mins. We did and call them back. At 12:30pm, we call tripadvisor again and this time it changed, they said they will give us full refund as long as we will rent again within a month to the same house. It took us 3months to plan this trip and they wanted us to reserve in 1 month. We called the property owner and his answer changed too, he said that we need to reserve for a month or two and we asked if we can just pay for cancellation fee, he said yes, $250 will be the cancellation fee and we approced that but we have to talk again to tripadvisor to finalize everything but the tripadvisor doesn't want to let us go without taking a lot of money from us. Around 7pm, i called tripadvisor and asked for supervisor to help, finally someone answered and work on the issue and finally found a solution, she told me that tripadvisor and me will share for the charges and we wil get our refund in 3 business days. But but but it changed again, after waiting for the refund, 5 days had passed and i called them again and now they told me that they will send the case to the higher level. The higher level messages me after few days and told me that the property owner is now charging me $380 as a good will gesture and this is full and final settlement that they can only offer. I demanded an explanation on how and why it change but now, they refunded me only the deposit i made and not responding on me for 2 days already. I guess i will lose all my $640 for nothing.\nIt just gives me a lot of stress, 2 weeks of stress.\nTrust me, it is not worth it. Just use airbnb or go directly to the hotel, cabins and rent there for a little much but saves you out of stress.\nI used cheapoair and i never get a problem getting refunds on cancellation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:51:30.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

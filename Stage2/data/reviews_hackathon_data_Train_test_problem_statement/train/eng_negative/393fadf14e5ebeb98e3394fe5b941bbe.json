I got a free wine voucher. When I tried to use it the voucher did not go through. So I was charged 106 dollars worth of wine. When I called to see why it did not go through the customer service lady I was on the phone with was polite and helpful at first but when I explained the issue her attitude changed right away to rude, condescending and very nasty. She told me it was all my fault cause I didn't follow the instructions properly when there were no clear or any instructions to follow in the first place. I was hoping to be able still use the voucher on the wine I had been charged for and just add on the 60 dollars I would need, but then she accused me of trying to get the wine I already ordered for free. I would never do such a thing. Also I was put down as a member without being notified until after the fact. I would have loved to be a member when I would have been able pay for it, but given what just happened and the other reviews I've read, I would never become a member. I'm sure there are other wine companies that I can join when the time comes. She voiced her joy in kicking me off the membership list when I asked her to take me off the membership list. She also used the excuse that my email were going into my spam folder which is complete BS because I checked my spam folder and nothing from naked wine. I notice they use that excuse a lot when they're also respond to negative reviews. Total smokescreen! Knowing what I know now and how poorly I was treated on the phone I would never become a member or would I buy from them either. All I wanted was for my voucher to go towards the wine I already order and to just charge me 60 dollars more wine which they refused. Now I out 100 dollars and they don't care because it is clear they're just a crooked business that only cares about getting people money.\nP.S I don't live in the state of Texas anymore. I live in New Mexico now!!!! So my voucher should have counted!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T08:45:47.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

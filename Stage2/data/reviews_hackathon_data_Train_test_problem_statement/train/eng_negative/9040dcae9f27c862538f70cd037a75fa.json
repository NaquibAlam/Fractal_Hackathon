I was advised that yes I could. When I dropped off my car I was told I could not and all was charged on my card (when I asked the agent three times to not do that). I walked way quite fuming, and low and behold I got an overdraft on my account. What did Budget offer me? A $50 coupon - no thank you. I WILL NEVER GO THROUGH RENTAL CARS. I was told by Budget it did not matter if my request through RentalCars was unlimited mileage they charge after 1050. Worst experience. Now I am stuck paying over the allotted mileage and over draft fees.

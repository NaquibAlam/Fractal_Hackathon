My ticket was purchased on line with credit card. She asked if I had a bank statement to prove when I am an international passenger. I showed the booking confirmation email from TAP printed out. Counter agent gave me a number to call 901 11 6718. Using an international phone, I made the call only to be not answered that I showed to the agent. She sent me to TAP office who like the counter agent said \"I don't know, you have to buy a new ticket\". Upon repeated requests, she called TAP and after 40 minutes of breathless moments, said someone at TAP had forgotten to make some entry and hence the booking was \"auto cancelled\", which she rectified. This is an unreasonable experience for an international passenger. If ever you purchase a ticket on line, you may need to carry your credit card statement to show it was paid. Also they may cancel your ticket and not notify you at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:50:15.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

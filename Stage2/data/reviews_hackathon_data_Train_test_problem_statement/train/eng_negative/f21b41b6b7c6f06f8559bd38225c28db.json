Avoid at all costs.\n---\nJournal:\nUpdate: Feb 21\nAfter publically promising on TrustPilot that someone would reach out to me to resolve the issue; Nobody from Amoma's team reached out. Will update on progress or lack of progress here daily.\nUpdate: Feb 22\nJust got an email stating something that I was told over 10 days ago; very similar message and still no resolution in sight:\n\"Our supplier is still discussing with the hotel the case which I have opened on your behalf, and as soon as I receive their final resolution I will revert to you with all of the necessary information.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:13:32.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

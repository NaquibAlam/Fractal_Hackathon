I didn't know that they will charged me - there was no information about an extra payments at the rental desk. They claim to this situation then that I should read very carefully whole contract (I did it - more than 10 years I'm renting cars). So in the beginning I paid twice more than reservation. The car has been with scratches, and no marks from their side about that, then they had charged me for existing scratch at the drop off (but only next day I had returned the car) - there is nobody in the evening to check the cars at parking. My option was without insurance, therefore they was waiting for any possibility to charge me for anything. In my experience Im renting cars without insurance and over years I haven't got any problems like with Goldcar at Bergamo. Moreover there is unreliable customer service by email. Avoid this car rental company as a fire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T16:47:43.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

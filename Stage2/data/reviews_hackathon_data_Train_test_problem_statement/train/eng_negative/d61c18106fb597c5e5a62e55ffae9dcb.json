It took approx. 1h45min until I could reach a person that was willing and able to answer my (rather easy) questions even though I paid an extra fee of €9.99 for the so-called premium service INCLUDING preferred accessibility to the customer support. At the first two attempts, I had to wait approx. 20min until I was connected to somebody from the hotline. In both cases, the connection was terminated 1min immeadiately after stating my reference number. At the third attempt (waiting time approx. another 30min) I spoke to a lady that was amazingly unfriendly and unpolite. She did not let me speak out even though I kindly asked her to let me speak out. When I insisted on speaking out she just hang up the phone so I needed to call the customer support for a fourth time and to wait approx. another 30min. This time the call center agent was able to help me. The price for my flight is good, otherwise I would not have booked it via Opodo. However, the hotline is a bad joke and that lady from the third call should be fired immediately. And taking €9.99 for this kind of \"premium service\" is deception from my perspective.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:58:17.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

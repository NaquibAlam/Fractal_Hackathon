At the moment of purchase the ticket the WEB page clearly indicated that I had 24 hour free cancellation from the moment of purchase. I decided to cancel the ticket and I called them they told me that I have to pay both penalty for airline and e-dreams administration fee. They told me that I have to prove the offer of free cancelation with a screen photo of the moment of the offer. Of course you do not do screen photos while booking the ticket. I when to the WEB I typed the same destination, date, flight and price and the offer of free cancelation appear again. I called e-dreams again I explained and I offer to sent the screen photo but they refuse claiming that the need the one of the particular booking I did. I way to scape responsibility and a clear way to offer something at the time of booking they are not ready to fulfill. I used them once but not more.

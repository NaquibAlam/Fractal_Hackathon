The eyeliner was packed in a white Dior Gift box (approx. 10\" x 4\") which itself was packed into a large cardboard box. This small a makeup product would easily fit in a small padded envelope and should not be the object of such waste of packaging. Sorry to say, I will never \"mail-order\" anything from Dior again as much as I like their products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:01:35.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Someone broke in, smashed a window of a bedroom, and took all our possessions, evaluating at AU$ 10,000. The property manager would not show up until after hundreds of calls and on-site visits. The broken window was not fixed until three months later.\nYou can never contact the property manager. If you call, he/she always ask you to leave a message which he/she will never reply. If you text, he/she just ignores. If you drop in on-site, he/she is always outside office. We experienced twice of changing property manager without any notice.\nExtremely bad experience.

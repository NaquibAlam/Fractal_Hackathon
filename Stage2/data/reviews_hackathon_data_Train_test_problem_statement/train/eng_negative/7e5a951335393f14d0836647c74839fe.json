However, I cannot receive the package because Amazon has chosen Purolator as a carrier. These guys cannot deliver anything except, probably, when you catch them on a street. This horrible service completely negates all the benefits of on-line purchases because you would have to fight with the delivery company for an extended period of time just to get your package. My advice to the consumers bying online from Amazon - please make sure that the package will be delivered NOT by Purolator.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T09:14:23.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

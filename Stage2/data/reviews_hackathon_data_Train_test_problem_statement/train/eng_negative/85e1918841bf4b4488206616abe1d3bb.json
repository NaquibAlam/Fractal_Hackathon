I have sent two messages to them asking for confirmation or help and have had no reply. What should I do now?? Any recommendations?? I need to have tickets booked but don't want to book any more elsewhere in case these ones end up being properly booked and not be able to get a refund. I screen shot the web page when the process was happening and got a booking ID but it isn't showing up in my log in and I have no tickets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:03:47.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

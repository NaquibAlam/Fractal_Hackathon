I ordered my correct size, which is a size 37. However, the SSense listing for the shoes showed the French sizes converted to Italian sizes, and SSense sent me a size 38. I can see from the listing that SSense believed a size 38 was a French 38, which they thought would fit like a size 37EU. It doesn't. I received a size 38EU, and the shoes are too big.\nI had just moved to a new city at the time I received these, and didn't realize SSense had sent me the wrong size until a few weeks later, so it was too late to exchange them for the correct size (assuming SSense would have agreed to do so).\nI took photos showing that the shoes I received from SSense are about 1/2\" longer than all of my size 37EU shoes.\nI am going to be very leery about ordering from SSense in the future, and will definitely no longer order Final Sale items.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T22:13:11.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

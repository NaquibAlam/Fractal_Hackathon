I was told it would be in in 2-4weeks. 6 weeks later still no delivery. I had to call and call. No one answers phone. No supervisor available. One guy finally figured out that they had it in Stock and didn't know why no one called. 3 days later a delivery guy calls in the middle of the day. I'm at work. Says he can't deliver later because he is behind. So we set up for the first delivery 2 days later. It's 2:00pm and I am still waiting. Got a hold of someone at 10am who said it would be the first delivery. We have to go somewhere... You're telling me that your first delivery is after 2pm?! In the end I will never know if I am going to get what I bought months ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T14:34:43.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

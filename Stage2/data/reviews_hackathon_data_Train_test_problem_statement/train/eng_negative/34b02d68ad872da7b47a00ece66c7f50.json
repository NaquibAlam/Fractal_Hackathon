A handful of issues but the latest one just breaks the camels back and comes back for more! They claim they never received our order but they have 2 pre authorizations on our account. They have promised to call back 4 times but just don't bother. They have an 01 number that diverts to a condescending \"gentleman\" somewhere in England. The first time he said it was because of fraud alerts as we hadn't made an order in awhile. The 2nd time and after, he repeats himself over and over but doesn't state how long it will take for the two transactions to reverse. Further, they tell me that they have nothing to do with it now, as we didn't make any order with them. He was extremely rude and said that he explained himself and I wasn't listening. They made no attempt to explain why bank of Ireland have confirmed the 2 pre auths from littlewoods. Bank of Ireland have told me to go through their fraud department at this point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T22:27:55.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

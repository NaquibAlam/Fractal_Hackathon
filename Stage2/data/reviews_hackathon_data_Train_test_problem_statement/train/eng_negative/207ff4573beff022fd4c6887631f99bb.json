Purolator is literally the WORST delivery company I have ever experienced. They have done this to me 3 times so far - either leaving packages outside my front door without notifying me or even knocking. The second time they did that the package was not there, but Purolator claimed that they left it. When I told them it wasn't there, they simply took no responsibility and essentially said they take no responsibility. Honestly what kind of delivery service leaves packages unattended? I've had UPS or Canada Post attempt to deliver my package multiple times all in an attempt to protect my package. This time around I had ordered something urgently, which I needed by a particular day as I was leaving out of town. Day one - they didn't deliver, said the address was \"undeliverable or unknown\". Okay then. Then I phoned them with instructions on how to deliver it, where to go, who to contact, gave them a back up number, and again they didn't deliver my package. According to the tracking my package is \"is still on its way, just delayed due to traffic\". Really? That was 5 hours ago. Honestly, how are they even still in business?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T16:29:09.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

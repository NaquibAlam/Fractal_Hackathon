Bought a build kit from their website. Tried cancelling the order when it was still being processed. Was sent a return slip instead of it being cancelled. Asked them why this was. Hours after trying to cancel it, was just told that it was now in process of being dispatched and they couldn't do anything about it. As such, stuck with border fees and would have to pay more than half the cost of the kit just to return it. To make matters worse, about half the parts in the kit were wrong (not what was listed in the kit to begin with).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:17:57.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

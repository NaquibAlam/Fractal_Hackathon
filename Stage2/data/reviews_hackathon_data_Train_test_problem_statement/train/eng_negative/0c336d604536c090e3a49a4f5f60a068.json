So I call customer service the gentleman that answers is totally rude from the jump. Then he flat out says there is no price gaurantee on Bookit and if you cancel there is no refund. An hour later I receive an email, mind you there is a time difference of 5 hours, that my flights are refundable if I call back by 8 pm. I call and guess what Bookit customer service is closed. This is the first company that doesn't have a price guarantee and we will not be using their services again.

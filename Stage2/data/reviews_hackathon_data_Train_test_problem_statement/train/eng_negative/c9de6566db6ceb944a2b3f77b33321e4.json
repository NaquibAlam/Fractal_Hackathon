I had the unit installed 2 months ago and was excited to get back on the road, but In these 2 months I have had to have my car towed 7 times to an intoxalock service center, then had to pay the garage for their work on the intoxalock, so far I have spent upwards of 1000 dollars, so it has costed me $500 a month so far. I would not recommend this company to anyone if you would like to continue to have money in your bank account... if I could rate them -5 I would.... and the customer service is horrible, one time I had to wait 4 hours trying to get ahold of someone that could help me.... just for them to tell me to get my car towed, I had to build a fire to keep from freezing on that snowy night while on hold.... Then a supervisor lady got on the phone and was completely rude to me, adding insult to injury, so now I decided I am going to let my vehicle sit until I can have this unit removed, and never talk to this horrible company again, I have to wait 10 more months to have the unit removed though because these crooks locked me into a contract with them. I picked my car up from the service center this morning in fact, I was heading home and stopped at the dollar store to get a few things, came back out and tried to power on my unit, it didn't work.... 10 minutes after it was fixed.... so I had to have my car towed yet again.... the intoxalock customer service didn't help at all, I would have rather talked to a monkey....

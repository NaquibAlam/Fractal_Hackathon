Then later that day I noticed one of the chairs was broken so I had to make arrangements to have it swapped out. They brought the replace but failed to credit me for the returned endtable and they billed me for a third table. It was extremely frustrating to have to prove to RC Wiley that they over billed me when I paid in full up front and never applied for credit. When I called the billing department the lady that answered was unsympathetic and unhelpful. RC Willey has quality problems with their furniture. Not sure if they just buy junk or it gets broken in transit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:21:10.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

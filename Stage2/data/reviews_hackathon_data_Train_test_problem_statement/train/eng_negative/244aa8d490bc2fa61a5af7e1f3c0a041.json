Ive been standing by my gate at the end of my drive the last 2 hours in the pouring rain, its now 2.30 and no sign of DPD and no offer of compensation or good will gesture,I will from now on avoid at all costs! rang back again and no answer just yet more patronizing ' sorry you weren't in to sign for your parcel' voice prompts, I WAS in DPD so stop second guessing and assuming on the automated phone messaging system! DPD used to be ok but now they seem worse than yodel! never again , a whole day wasted! I'm sure if it had been a 50 inch TV they'd have left it in the shed unsigned! useless! if I get a pathetic automated reply on here such as email so and so and we will get it sorted I will send my phone number for DPD to ring me to sort out some good will gesture or cover the cost of my time wasted! its a whole day totally wasted now im all behind with my schedule!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:26:04.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

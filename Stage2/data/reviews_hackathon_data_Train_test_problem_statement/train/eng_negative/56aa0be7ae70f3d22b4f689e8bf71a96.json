But got a call the following day to say the item was not available when they went to pick it for dispatch, and they would refund my money if I didn't want any other item instead. Strange thing is I was watching the item for a few days before I ordered it and stock went from 16 to 10 over a week so someone was buying it. Not acceptable that a company of this size cannot supply an item if stock shows 10, I can understand if it was showing 1 as it could be lost or soiled, but 10. Needless to say I won't bother using this company again. There are many other places to but these items.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T10:39:59.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

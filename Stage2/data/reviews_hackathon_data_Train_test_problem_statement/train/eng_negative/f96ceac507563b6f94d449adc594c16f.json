They must of realise that there was more than a good chance that most people and company offices close at 5.30pm. I did not know till DX emailed me (no the day!) that it may not get there till 6 , I email them and got know response. I ordered them early so they ( you) would have plenty off time to get there at a reasonable time. I can not see why as it was Valentine's Day and they new it was flowers that this is to much to ask and why this did not happen. It completely ruined the hole point of getting them delivered to her place of work and then to add insult to injury the flowers look nothing like as good as they do in your photograph, the Lily's did not even open till the roses were almost dead. Leaving my hole experience of your company a complete and utter let down.\nI have been putting of make my review till now as to give you ample time to put things right through my many Emails only to be fobbed off time and time again. Leaving me know choice but to write this review.\nThere for it is in the strongest possible terms that I recommend that anyone thinking of using this company to send a loved one or anyone else for that matter flowers not to, to avoid complete and utter disappointment.\nThe flowers I ordered were simply substandard.\nRegards Chris slack", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T15:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:49:23.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

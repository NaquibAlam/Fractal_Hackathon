I spent nearly $4,000 in the store minus delivery (separate charges) when i asked about pick up they told me it will be all ready for pick up next day. I rented a u haul for the day of pick up only to find out some of the stuff i bought the day before was sold to another customer, when i asked when would the other items be available they lied to me and said the next day they have another delivery of stock coming in they also told me they would deliver it to my home for free just for having a bad experience with my purchase. 2 weeks went by and still missing my items well worth $700 . Finally i got tired of being lied to and called in to speak to a manager which told me they still dont have my items, furious i calmly told manager to refund me for the items . As i waited on hold he came back to tell me the computer was marking the inventory wrong and they had it all along, really?? This sounded fishy to me, all of my items suddenly turn up when i demanded a refund watch out with this store not to mention they are pricey and didnt even make a attempt to offer me compensation for my trouble NEVER buyin here again! Made 2 trips total of 180 min from home and a total of $175 in uhaul rentals all H.Q had to say was we will look into it to make sure this doesnt happen in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:08:44.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

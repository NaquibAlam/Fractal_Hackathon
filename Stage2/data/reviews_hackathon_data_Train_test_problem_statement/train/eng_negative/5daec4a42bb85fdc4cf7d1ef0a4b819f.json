I had to phone and Quote: a reference number and nobody ever seemed to know it understand where we were in the process and I would have to explain the situation over and over. This didn't happen once, it happened at least 6 times. I was looking for spare parts and nobody seemed to be able to find them and when we finally figured it out they couldn't figure out if they had them in stock and when they figured that out they weren't sure if they could ship them. Every single step was excruciating.\nI was at home without the use of 3 showers and nobody at Hudson Reed seemed to care that their products were crap and all failed at the same time or help me with any expediency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T13:31:45.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

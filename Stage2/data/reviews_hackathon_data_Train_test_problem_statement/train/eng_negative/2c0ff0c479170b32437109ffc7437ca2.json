All of this customer service crap they yell and \"stand by\" is clearly not true. Ive been using lyft for a while and it has been ok. The account that I use for my miscellaneous work activity was compromised and was OVERDRAWN due to a 'reoccurring fee'. I DID NOT TAKE THESE RIDES AND I ENDED UP PAYING FOR THEM. OVERDRAFT DRAFT FEES AND ALL. I have emailed and emailed and have tried to resolve this issue with Lyft and they, NOT ONCE, have contacted me back regarding this issue. On top of that...my lyft account is frozen/closed and i cant even use it. Hmmmm...i wonder why? Seeing that no one has contacted me back....how is it possible? That tells me that someone saw the MULTIPLE EMAILS and took THEIR action without contacting me. They will contact you regarding AAANNNNY other issue... jusy not this one. I at one point even signed up to drive for lyft b/c i thought the company was top notch...NOPE. Lyft..you guys suck. I hope youre reoccurring charge is worth doing people dirty and not trying to help the situation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:14:50.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

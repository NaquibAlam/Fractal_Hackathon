I was leased a vehicle with a know damaged left tire (on pre trip documents). I was assured it was stable however it tore open and had to be changed after two hours of driving. Fortunately I was no longer on the freeway where it could have been extremely dangerous if it blew at 110kph. I changed the tire and reported the fault and Redspot we're going to charge me $550. After arguing this cost when I dropped off the car they waved the fee. I was surprised they charged me for the hire at all after that incident.

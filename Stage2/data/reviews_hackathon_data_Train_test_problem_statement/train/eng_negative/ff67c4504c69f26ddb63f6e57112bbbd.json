We leave in 4 days and have not been supplied a single detail of where we are staying or any of the facilities in the property or nearby. I spent hours looking through their properties only to be told after booking, it may not be the property we chose.So why give us all the choice? I spent hours choosing! I have been requesting the details of the property we are getting on a regular basis from at Sue of Flexible Pay Vacations who could not have been more unhelpful. It is like she is withholding the information on purpose to make us more anxious.She replies to my emails with 1 word or 1 sentence answers with no information what-so-ever. I approached Booking.com two days ago to help get some information and they have not come back to me either. What am I supposed to do if I miss any excursions because they have been booked by the time I get there? I cannot get any replies from either of the booking companies. I am so stressed and frustrated, I cannot even begin to explain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T04:41:21.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

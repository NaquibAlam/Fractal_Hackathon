The parts number given for the airbag assist would have worked since they mounted on the bump stop brackets attached to the leaf springs. The spacers on the other hand were for an axel mounted system. if i had of purchased this combo i would have an airbag set up that is lacking in structural rigidity due to the lack of reinforcement of the bump stop bracket and a waist of $100 due to have useless spacers. Overall the only thing that kept me from making this mistake is my own research and more through review of the installation instructions you provide on your website. So thank you for those! I think the guidance was given based on a computer programmed response and not so much the person. Yes this approach of standardized problem responses may improve response times and cut costs for training personnel. However, they do lead to these mistakes not to mention you run the risk of a detachment of the company from the customer which inevitably causes a loss of customer loyalty. Thanks for the help though, your website has a great selection of products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T21:36:31.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

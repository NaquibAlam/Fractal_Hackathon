People put in their hard earned money to travel once a year. It's not like we book tickets only for them to get cancelled and then the airlines promising to return them in 15-30 working days. Not everyone has a huge amount sitting in their bank accounts to keep booking tickets until Bravofly decides to confirm them when it feels like.\nThey have horrible customer service people on phone, who do not understand what you're saying, it takes you to a level of frustration where you give up on your money.\nI loved the online booking experience this time, where everything was mentioned perfectly and I could book the baggage amount as well.\nBut no confirmation leads to frustration to customers - and then losing them.\nI need my confirmation soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T16:02:33.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I spent a small fortune on the glasses because I had such an amazing experience the first time. I received 6 emails asking to verify the small amount charged to my card for security purposes, then my order would be released. I complied each and every time, the repeated phone calls at my work were answered with the same request for the same amount. I gave the amount expecting my order. I still have not gotten my glasses, I have a reprimand at work for the repeated phone calls and as I was writing this review I received yet another e mail asking for me to verify the stinking $ 2.33 charge! I'm starting to think I am being scammed! Please, just send me my orders already, it has been 2 weeks .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:44:59.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

On my H36 - the USB charger stopped working after about 4 charges to the battery. The 2nd item - H11WH - will not connect to Wi-Fi using enclosed instructions APP. NOT able to use the camera or fly this quad via my phone. JJRC manufactured these but TOMTOP NEEDS to stand behind what they sell. CS took 3 weeks to respond to my emails FULLY explaining my probs - only to say \"Really sorry to hear that. Is that possible to bother you to take a small video which can show this problem and send the video to me? because the video maybe can show better . I sent \"PICS\" and TOMTOP CS then responded with the exact same message? Really? Appears their avoiding my simple explanation of the problems. NOT getting any satisfaction from their so called customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:19:03.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

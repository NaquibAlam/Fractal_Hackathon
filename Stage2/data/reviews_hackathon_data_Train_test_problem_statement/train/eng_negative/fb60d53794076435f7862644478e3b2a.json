There are 2 separate documents for international. It is not a single page PDF.\n___\"_\"____\nI wanted to send a document internationally instead of parcel as PM was cheaper than USPS by $5/- with door to door service also. Chat person said documents can also be sent.\n1. But UI sucks. there is no option to choose document. So how to enter dimensions or document?\n2. If you enter a value > $0/- then you need customs form and you will have delays. The UI does not tell you this.\n3. The printouts are 2 separate PDF instead of 2 pages of a single PDF. So I didnt know I was supposed to print & attach 2nd one which is very hidden.\n4. PM does not print out package requirements before courier person picks up. For e.g. why doesnt courier person detect customs form was missing. So my shipment was delayed by 10 days sitting in customs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:54:17.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

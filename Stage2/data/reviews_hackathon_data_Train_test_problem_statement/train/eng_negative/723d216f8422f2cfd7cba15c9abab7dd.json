But if the shipment gets lost or damage you're screwed. Doesn't matter if you ordered white T-shirt and they sent your pink T-shirts you still have to pay. That is some terrible business practices.\nSome of the worst customer service on the planet at this place if you ever try to contact them they are useless.\nBut like I said there are some killer deals on there so it's kind of hard to avoid using it kind of like Ebay, but worse!\nHere is a video of what the defective cartridges do!\nsearch this number at youtube hX3HGUfaBMM ( trust pilot does not allow direct links)\nPretty obvious they are defective if you ask me, but yet I am still responsible for shipping them back. going to cost me a couple hundred dollars but they will repay me so they say. Very hard to trust them however.\nPO number is 335117224\nTo make things worse now they have made it to where I cannot pay with a credit card to buy from legitimate sellers on dh gate. Who is the victim here? They're making me feel like a criminal, when the reality is you are letting a seller vaperguider02 rip people off.\nJustin", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:06:24.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

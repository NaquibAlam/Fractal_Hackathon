I actually figured how to get into it on my own as it took a few day for the course material to be accessible. The only support is by email. When I finally went through my bank for a refund i received a call from them which was from a middle eastern country. This is not an American company. They offered a refund of the course if i changed my rating soo they could look good. Well I changed it from one star to two stars.I highly suggest you take your money and your time some place else for needed credits. As the CPR and First Aid material was out dated and lacking any real information. The yoga course is not highly prized if you actually want to become an instructor. It is ok if your just wanting some information than it is cheaper than the book store. It you are trying to quickly build a resume this is a fast option other than that i do not recommend sorry to say.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T23:25:57.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

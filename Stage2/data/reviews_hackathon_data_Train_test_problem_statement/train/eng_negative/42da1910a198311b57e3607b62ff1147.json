The card did not arrived prior to my airline departure on the following Monday morning. As a consequence I will not be able to use the card for another 90 days, thus the title for the review, because I could have probably walked across the country in less time that it is going to take for me to simply activate the card. Bottom line is if have not even had an opportunity to use the service. I'm giving it a 1 star rating now, as I suspect there will be some sort of issue and some money lost by me as I will be delaying the activation of the service for some time. Sorry, a one star rating it is. On the other hand, if this AUTOMATED service has the smarts to send me another opportunity to rate the OneSim in the next 6 months I'd be happy to add comments that are less skewed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:21:42.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Turned up on time , which was sadly was end of the good stuff. The fitter sent can only be categorised as a clown. Tried to tell me my car had been modified, lowered ( 96 plate mgf 46k on the clock and 100% original) and gave 101 reasons why he could not change the tyres. (All he had to do was ask me for my cars jack to enable to raise enough to allow him to get the trolley jack under the car. Barely Rocket Science. I received a call from Tyres on the drive and agreed to let them try again.\nTwo fitters attended following day and fitted the four tyres.\nI am not angry , just very irritated and will not use again on my other vehicles.\nIn response to your reply , you have simply skipped over the main issue. The fitter you sent was clueless and his only value was pure entertainment to the neighbourhood . The Excellence Manager of this clown I would suggest is also failing. I would really like some explanation as to the utter nonsense this guy was speaking and his inability to see the obvious solution staring him in the face. Technical Managers , Technicians, call them what you like .,fact is total incompetence ensures that such titles are worthless.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:56:05.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

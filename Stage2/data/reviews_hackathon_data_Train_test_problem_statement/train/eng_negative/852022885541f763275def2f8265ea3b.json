I had paid total 90 euros for car rental + insurance with AutoEurope.\nI called AutoEurope when I was I the desk, and handed my phone to the Goldcar women at the desk, and they argued for some time, because AutoEurope insisted that the insurance I had bought with them was valid.\nI was traveling alone with my daugter 2,5 years old, so after 30-40 minutes I had to pay the insurance and get the car.\nThe lady at the Goldcar desk had clearly lied to me the sell me extra insurance, that I didnt needed, because I was already covered at AutoEurope.\nI can now see that Goldcar has recently been fined aprox 2 mill euros for selling insurance to customers that they didnt need.\nI was scammed unfortunately. I have written their customer service, but expect to get a new lie from them and no refund.\nDont EVER use this Car Rental Company, they will lie to oyu to sell useless insurance. And they exploit that customers dont know the jungle of car rental insurance!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:44:14.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My mother Paulette WhitneyMcClain recommended me to you because she's been with you for years. My package arrived at my Christmas destination in Vegas. When the 1st of 3017 rolled around because I had just mad a purchase, I opted to skip the month. However, I was still charged the $39.95. When I received that email I immediately called and asked for a refund. My refund was granted. BUT SHOEDAZZLE turned right back around and charged me AGAIN for the $39.95for the 3bd time in January. I was told I would be getting a refund for the 3nd time. However, I'm still waiting and Customer Service keeps telling me that I have bee refunded and I can't get back into my account because it was closed. I will be asking them to reopen because my boots that I ordered are too small and I need to exchange them per my VIP status that I had, and then hopefully I can see the messed up transactions in my account so I can prove that they still owe my my 2nd $39.95 they deducted and is shirt in my checking account with my bank.\nThank you!\nEbone' Whitney", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:56:44.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

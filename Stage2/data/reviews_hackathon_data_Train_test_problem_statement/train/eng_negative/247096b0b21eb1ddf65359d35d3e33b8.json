I've planned my journey to start at 13 of February\nThe flight from Instanbul to Addis was cancelled. I believe that flugladen.de has absolutely nothing to do with that and it's not their fault. But there are few other things...\nThe solution they proposed didn't satisfy me. Waiting 24 hours for the flight cannot be an option. Unfortunately I could only change the day of the flight to Addis, but not the flight back. That means I would have to stay shorter than I wanted.\nWhen I ordered the tickets and got the confirmation the time of the journey included the waiting time for the other flight. When I got the information about reschudeling the flight then suddenly the time of the journey didn't include the waiting time, which was actually around 24 hours! I've almost missed that information, and I'm sure a lot of people would simple not notice that the date of the flight is different!! That is not how you do things!\nWanted to cancel the flight by phone, and get the written confirmation that it had been cancelled by email. You know, just for my own safety, to make sure that I will really get the money back and nobody will tell me after all 'but you didn't cancel anything'. Not possible for flugladen.de Instead of that I need to write an email that I want to cancel, then wait for their answer. So i did, and I'm still waiting for their answer...\nWhat is the waiting time to get the money back? 8 weeks :) To take it from my credit card they only needed a second!\nEDIT:\nI would love to contact with you, but unfortunately since Wednesday I can't even reach you! You didn't answer my e-mail which I've sent you 2 days ago. I tried to cancel the flight through your homepage - still no answer. Instead of answering that comment to show how much you care it would make me really happy to get a reply on my email. In addition I have to say that your hotline is some kind of a joke. I had an honor to talk with you once , then I've tried at least 15 times to talk with somebody, called from 3 different numbers, at different times, from Wednesday up to Friday. After listening to your beautiful song for about 1 minute I always got disconnected.\nOh and about the booking number which you are asking. Don't you have it already? I could not post that review without including the booking number so please... let's be serious.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:09:18.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The order was cancelled Monday January 9, saying the website mistakenly showed the product was in stock when it wasn't. They cancelled the small portion of the transaction going through my credit card, but my gift cards still show that they've been used and have a 0 balance. I contacted customer service Monday evening, and again Thursday evening, and have not heard anything back from them. And then Thursday, the product I ordered, is back in stock. Which means they could have just delayed my order until then, and fulfilled it at that point. I have had no response from customer service after a full week at this point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:38:26.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

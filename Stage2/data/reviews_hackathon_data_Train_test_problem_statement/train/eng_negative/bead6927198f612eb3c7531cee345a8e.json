I made a prepaid reservation with Alamo at this location in February 2017 and arrived to learn that my reservation would be handled by Locauto, which online reviews confirm to be one of the worst rental companies. I did not receive the make or size of the car that I had booked (they gave me a much larger car that was unwieldy in the medieval villages that we were visiting). Worse, upon my return, Locauto demanded 496 Euro for two small, pre-existing scratches on the car. Incredible! Of course, I refused to pay these made up charges. Do not rent from Locauto or the Catania airport Alamo. We have had great experiences with Auto Europe in Sicily and the rest of Italy, which I will stick to from now on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T22:44:23.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

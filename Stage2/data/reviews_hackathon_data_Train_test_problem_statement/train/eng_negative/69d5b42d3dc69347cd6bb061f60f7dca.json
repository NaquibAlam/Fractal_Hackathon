It's ridiculous! I just made a 150 mile trip for no reason whatsoever as they decided by VIN an expansion tank for a mk1 Peugeot is the same as a mk2. It's BASIC part selling!\nPart quality is so poor that many times they are not even able to be fitted. I've tried to like this company so many times but have been let down on each occasion and seen so many other customers receive parts which I know are not correct!\nWhat I can't understand is why the general public are so gormless because they keep using them.\nThere are so many better car parts companies out there if you just GOOGLE them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:13:48.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

He moved 1 block away from his old apartment where he already had telephone (land line) service with Frontier. He moved out on Jan 21st and was told that afternoon his service with the same number and service would be on in the afternoon. Well it did not come on until Wednesday! It took 4 days for his phone to finally have service!! I complained to Customer Service which really did no good. I even spoke to a \"Supervisor\" who ended up telling me the tech dept would have to help and there was nothing she could do!Then that week end his phone had no service from Fri-Tues!! The next week end he had no service from Fri-Weds. I called them pretty upset as my dad is 87 yrs old and legally blind. I told them HE NEEDS A WORKING PHONE LINE!!! They FINALLY sent someone out to check on the problem and it turns out it the line needed a Module with a cap? I guess the \"module\" was moving around without a cap and the line would work and then not work.The service man finally fixed it and after 13 days without service, it is their fault and I want those 13 days credited to his account! I just can't find a way to email this complaint to them. If we had a different choice I would definitely switch!!! Don't have Frontier for you telephone or anything else!!! I wasted MANY hours on the phone with them just trying to get service for my dad's phone. A horrible experience!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:43:47.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We put our baby in the car seat and tested it with him. We drove to the shop and back. a 4 mile journey. He was asleep but there is very little recline in the seat and he just kept falling forward so the seat was not safe for him to be in it. I went to return the seat and get the next one the \"faux leather one\" however i was told that as we had sat our baby in the seat it was deemed as used and they would not accept the return. so a \"30 day no quibble money back guarantee\" does not exist. How else can you determine if the seat is the correct one if you dont sit the baby into it. This is shocking cowboy stuff and i would strongly recommend anyone to pause and think hard before you buy this. They should clearly state \"placing your child in the seat voids the guarantee\" not have it hidden at the bottom of their website in small print. Even talking with the staff she straight away said \"no you cannot return it if you used it\", there was zero listening and she went straight on the defensive which indicates to me that this is a regular event. Just buy with extreme caution or go to a reputable shop or trader", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T13:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:04:51.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

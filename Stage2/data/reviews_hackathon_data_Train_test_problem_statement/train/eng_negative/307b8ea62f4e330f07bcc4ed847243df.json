Excellent cover â€“ all exterior & mechanical parts. Far cheaper than typical over-the-counter cover. Interested? Just choose your car, then add Full Protection.\"\nAnd you choose \"Full Protection\". Then at the airport counter, AVIS/BUDGET representative says that Rentalcars.com does not provide full protection. Then you pay additional coverage. Then you ask Rentalcars.com why their \"Full Protection\" is not recognized by AVIS/BUDGET. Then a representative from Rentalcars.com apologizes for \"any confusions\" regarding the purchase of \"Full protection\" via Rentalcars.com and refund their \"Full protection\" price. They even mention that you should phone them when dealing with the AVIS/BUDGET representative in order to confront \"Full Protection\" protection provided by them with \"additional coverage\" from AVIS/BUDGET. Of course you should phone them, because that's why you choose a car broker in the first place, to complicate your life.\nUse Rentalcars.com to search for cars and hire the car directly from the provider. In this way they will eventually clarify \"confusions\" regarding the purchase of \"Full protection\", warn you BEFORE getting to deal with the rental car representative and display a BIG phone number so you may step at the counter and put a trickster from Rentalcars.com in direct contact with the trickster from AVIS/BUDGET. They may eventually cancel themselves and you will not have to deal with the aftermath for weeks after your car hire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:21:57.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

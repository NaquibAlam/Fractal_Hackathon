This past 2 orders have not been so good. I ordered 3 sets of sheets. I grey set full, 1 blue set Queen. 1 Lavender set King. I even called after placing order and spoke with one of your Reps who changed the quantity of 1set. I received 2blue Queen, 1set King but no Grey full. The recent chair cover came in bag marked chocolate but was a grey cover inside that was readily visible. As I am 75yrs old and handicapped it's hard for me to get returns off, so I just give them to family members. I shop on line a lot. It beats kgging intend and struggling with them from stores. Like I said I have been very happy with your items n print delivery andI am sorry to have to send this", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T14:00:17.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

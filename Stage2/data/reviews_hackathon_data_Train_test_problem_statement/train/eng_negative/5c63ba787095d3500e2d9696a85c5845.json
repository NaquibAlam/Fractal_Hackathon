This new Hotpoint Aquarius was a major desaster. It was so noisy that a friend sitting in the lounge thought he had heard an aeroplane.The icebox was a bizarre design\nwhich did not make ice as the water kept flowing out of it,building up an iceberg on the rack, but no ice to use. I disliked the fridge from day one, but between a.o.and Hotpoint it took four months of\ncorrespondence,telephone calls and aggro to return. A.o's telephone system is set up in a way\nthat it puts you through to the manufacturer immediately,\nHotpoint refers you back immediately to a.o.,both parties washing their hands of the problem.\nWhilst these companies play ball with the customer you start running out of time and getting very frustrated. Hotpoint keeps sending engineers in spite of you explaining that it is the de sign you are\nobjecting to, not an engineering issue, You waste four full days waiting in for four engineers when you do not even want one. In the end I resolved my problem through the \"Resolve your claim website\"\nand was able to replace the Hotpoint by this wonderful Samsung which works like a dream.\nIt is very well and intelligently designed, space is used to its best advantage, quiet, lovely\nto look at, works efficiently. A.o on the phone was very helpful when it came to finally change the fridges, but the delivery was another disaster. I had two builders in my kitchen when the\nfridge freezer came, and they could not believe the rudeness. They plonked the huge freezer in the middle of the kitchen and refused to remove the packaging. I am a person in my late seventies,\nand could not have coped with the packaging without my builders. There was no question with\nhelping to install the fridge. Finally I am de lighted to have this Samsung, but would never again\nbuy an appliance on the internet.Sorry, this was a bad experience which I could not recommend to a friend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:05:01.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Phone was then shipped 5 days after stated time and arrived with a sound issue. All setting are on and on high but when people ring, text or email me all I get is vibrate. Only thing that fixes it is a factory reset and that only works for a couple of days then you have to do it again.\nThere support email and customer services ignore any correspondence so will now go to my card company and get a refund. Don't buy Chinese goods if your from UK. Rip off", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T18:25:20.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

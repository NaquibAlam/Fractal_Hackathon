Got my e-ticket, logged on to BA site to reserve seats, only 3 of 5 flights booked appeared. Rung travel up to find 2 flights had been canceled. They have re-booked me new flights but they left it up to me to find out they had been canceled. Also i'm sure call centre is in India, every time I've rung I've got someone with a heavy accent who can't understand me. Think fakes names are used as when e-mailing these people they have very British/Caucasian names. Then when you call them the guy who answers definitely doesn't sound like a 'John Thompson'. Not actually travelled yet, this is just experience so far. Hope it gets better from this point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T11:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:33:35.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

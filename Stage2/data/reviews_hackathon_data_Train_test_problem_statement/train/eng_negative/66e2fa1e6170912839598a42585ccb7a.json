I jumped on the ticket. Excited about the price and missing the very last spot where it stated what the actual charge was $338. Nearly $80 more than the advertised price. Very dissatisfied with this creative marketing and pricing. I will not use this site again unless there is some action taken to rectify this sneaky charge. Furthermore, I will make sure that I let everyone whom I speak to regarding travel know about your fine print scheme to lure you in for a great deal.

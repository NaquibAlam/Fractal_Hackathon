I liked the choices and was pleased I could switch out separate products. On the website it says same day delivery for Sydney orders. So I was quite comfortable selecting the Australia Post option. I placed my order on Feb 12th and when asked preferred day for delivery I selected Feb 16th. On the 14th I received an email from Australia Post saying my shipment had been delayed and would be sent on the 15th. Unfortunately the package never arrived and when my sister followed up on the 17th with 'A Little Luxury' she was told they would follow up and get back to her. Unfortunately nobody got back to her and she followed up again on the 20th where the woman she spoke to did not offer any apology and basically told her these things happen. When we looked up the tracking we could see the parcel had actually gone all the way to Brisbane. My sister finally received her birthday package on the 21st - 5 days after my requested day. Whilst I understand Little Luxury can not control Australia Post I was so disappointed that there was no follow up and more importantly no apology. I have used this site previously and had recommended it to friends but after this experience I will no longer recommend it. This was a special birthday and I specifically ordered this basket for my sister to take on her trip away and because of the delay she did not have it- SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:30:27.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

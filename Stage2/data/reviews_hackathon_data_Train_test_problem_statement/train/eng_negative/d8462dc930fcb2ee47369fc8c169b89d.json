One of the reasons I purchased a Yowza was the 5 yr warranty. Unfortunately, a warranty is only good as the company offering it. Yowza has been terrible in my warranty claim handling thus far.\n2. The plastic housing was very difficult to align when assembling the machine. Even the pre-assembled housing is not aligned correctly out of the box.\n3. The machine made unusual noises from the onset.\n4. The motor apparently has failed.\n5. Customer service is awful. Having to send numerous emails that have NEVER been replied to a single time. Calls are not returned. When you finally get somebody on the phone (Ashley Hall), he tries to rush you off the call. You have to go out of your way to keep trying to call them to get somebody in person. I guess they hope the customer will eventually get frustrated and give up.\n6. Warranty parts are not shipped expedited. Took nearly a week to get a stocked replacement console despite already experiencing a 3-week delay. IMO it was merely a delay tactic by Ashley Hall. (This did not fix the problem).\n7. Heart rate monitor is a joke. One of the major reasons I purchased the machine was the claim that it has heart rate control. While it does technically have it, the heart rate is highly inaccurate which makes this feature useless.\n8. The ergonomic motion of the machine is poor. It is not a smooth consistent motion. Rather the machine (when it was working) has more resistance at certain points in the motion than others. So, it feels like a buildup and release, buildup, release, etc. This is not just due to the failed motor as the machine still has this awkward motion now with no resistance.\n9. Yowza apparently doesn’t stock common replacement parts such as new motors. Despite a new motor allegedly being ordered a month ago, I’ve received no indication when the motor will arrive. No tracking number. Only excuses from Ashley on the one phone call I managed to have with him. One of his excuses was John Simone the original service person was on leave and that's why nobody returned my call. Inexcusable. If a service person is out, a reputable company would engage a substitute service person.\nThis elliptical was the most expensive purchase I made in 2016 as a gift for my wife. She used the machine hardly 2 months before the motor failed. Now, the machine sits there useless. At this point with all the issues I’ve experienced, I’m requesting Yowza refund my money. I am very disappointed with the Yowza machine and the Yowza company. Hoping posting this review will help Yowza to respond. Since they don't respond to emails or return phone calls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:46:07.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

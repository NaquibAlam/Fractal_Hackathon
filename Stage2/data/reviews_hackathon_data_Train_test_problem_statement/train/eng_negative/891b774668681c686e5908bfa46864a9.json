I purchased 2 tickets to Panic! In The Disco as a gift for my daughter. A sold out concert, I bought these weeks before the event. I then waited for them to arrive. And waited, waited TR will not review the situation until 48 hours before the event. Sent an email enquiry, no tickets and nothing will be done until 24 hours before the event. Another email, still no tickets. The morning of the concert I phone. Yes they had tried to contact the seller. Still no tickets. By this stage we assume the seller has a better offer and has reneged on the sale. They finally arrived just a few hours before the concert much to everyones relief. So narrowly avoided teenage heartbreak, but an emotional rollercoaster. Too much hassle to be chasing tickets and be left in limbo having committed and paid for them but not received them. You have lost the opportunity to purchase elsewhere. Try explaining to a teenager that the \"guarantee\" does not mean you will get the tickets, but that you will be refunded if they do not arrive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T21:06:27.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

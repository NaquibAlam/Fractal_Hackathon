Airline do not have my flight details or have the flight last minute has offered in place of the cancelled flight. Still without flight or information and prices of flights have gone up with other airlines. Have been on hold over an hour with reluctant mananager contact. Appalling service and shortly I shall be taking this to social media and ressolver as I've had to constantly phone companies to find out about my 'flight'. Passed on from one person to another being falsely promised for call backs which I've never once received. Was told airline haven't responded after being called and emailed...at what point will they realise the company won't get back to them? The day before my travel day?? Haven't been able to plan or book hotel due to this and prices are constantly increasing...not happy and will never book flights through them again. Customer service so infuriating, keep getting told my issue is being escalated... how far does it need to be escalated before someone realises that this flight isn't available?!!! Constantly told to wait 24hrs, 48hrs, and recently 72hrs and it will be sorted...STILL WAITING.

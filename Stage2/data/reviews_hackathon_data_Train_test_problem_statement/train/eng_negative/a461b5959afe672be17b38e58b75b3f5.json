On the 200 mile drive home numerous faults were identified including a broken door lock, smelly air con and blown speakers!\nI immediately reported this and it was agreed that I could take the car into my local dealer in Colchester. They ordered the relevant parts and the vehicle was booked in.\nOn the day work started the dealership phoned to say there were serious problems with the vehicle and the amplifier was underwater and there was a large amount of water in the rear of the vehicle causing various degrees of corrosion.\nI immediately informed Stratstone and rejected the vehicle, I was then informed it was my responsibility to return the vehicle (200 miles away). I asked how I would be able to get home after this and was told they would give me a lift to Derby train station. What a joke. I then had to pay for the car to be transported back to Derby.\nI requested that this money be refunded but was told no.\nI then contacted the pathetic BMW customer services team (Sarah), who having heard my story took ten mins to decide that they wouldn't help and couldn't do anything about the situation.\nBMW proudly advertise they carry out exhaustive checks on their vehicles, in my case it is obvious that did not occur and the dealership does not have the decency to to pay for the vehicles return or explain how the vehicle was supplied in such a bad state.\nMy next move will be a solicitor as I will not let this drop.\nBMW have now lost another customer although with their profits they won't give a damn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:13:59.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

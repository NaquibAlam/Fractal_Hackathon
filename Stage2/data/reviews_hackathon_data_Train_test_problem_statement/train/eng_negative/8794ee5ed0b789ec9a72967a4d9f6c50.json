As we booked a Insignia the company gave us a Dacia which is at least 1/3 of the price. We could get the insignia we paid for already for an extra of 21 euro extra per day. We didn't do that.\nWhen contacted rentalcars about this. The feedback we got was that the cars are the same size and have 5 doors, airco and a stick. When we gave the argument so has a BMW 3 series or 5 it went silence. In reviews you can even read that the Dacia is not a secure car and shouldn't be rented at all. They also said that Megadrive didn't charge us anything extra. That is because we didn't pay the 21 euro.\nNext point was that we pre paid a full coverage insurance on rentalcars. When we told this at MegaDrive she said it was not possible and need to be paid at the counter. When I presented the staff that I paid they laugh at me and did swipe my card anyway. Also rentalcars doesn't do anything other then pay me the money back for the insurance instead of doing something about the fraudulent staff at MegaDrive.\nWe talked with rentalcars twice on the phone but the mantra back was we are independent and you don't rent a brand but a 'car' which has the same specs like amount of doors, airco, stick etc .... total BS of course\nI wouldn't rent here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T05:18:25.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

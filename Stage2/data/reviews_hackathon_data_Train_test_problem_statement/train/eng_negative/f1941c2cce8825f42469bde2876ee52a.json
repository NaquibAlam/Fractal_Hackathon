I lived overseas in the Philippines for 6 years and worked with US clients and paypal was absolutely my best friend in business. When I started a web company - I relied on that same friend - paypal. It took me over a year to develop my website but I still tried to sell products on it while the site was still a work in progress. Amazingly I had a few sales - which paypal processed. My business is now in full swing. I sell a high end product and as much as 40% of my well heeled customers use the American express card. For the past 60 hours - my site cannot accept the Amex card. Paypal has no reason why, they cant figure out why the card wont process, they wont credit my monthly fee to me and they can only state - we are doing our best. So....if you want the possibility of your business to not be able to take a payment for more than 2 days with no explanation or reason why - and with no end in sight - then PayPal is the company for you", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:08:17.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A man who called himself Andii said that for $946, he had a flight for me...listing all details. He SAID he couldn't confirm it unless I gave him ALL my personal information like birthdate, mailing address home phone # as well as my full Visa card. I said why? He said company policy and can't book flight without. So I gave him. He says...oh sorry this fight not available and then looks at another one...(despite website showing 10 other alternatives for $946...) he says this one is $971..! So o agree again. Then I tell him, I have cap on my visa and need to increase it. How much time do I have? He gave me confirmation # and says 30 minutes. Called visa, I was back in 10 mins!\nCalled company..they said it was called because not enf funds. I said why he went ahead when I told him what I was going to do!!?? So I now rebooked. This woman now says flights for $946 are available! I got really mad and told her...stop! Something wrong. I rushed to my visa people and they told me $529.33 was charged together with ANOTHER $529.33..both half an hour apart! This $539.33 amount was only half the ticket. Where was the rest? They said you have to go back and get company to debit my acct.\nI spent over 1 1/2 hours with transit # from visa to get my amts cancelled. Woman said she could do one BUT couldn't find other one as there was no confirmation number. I explained everything. I said how can you charge when I never approved! It was a huge huge long argument! They hung up on me, as I demanded both charges be returned immediately without penalty as they did not charge whole amount and told me so many stories. What was weird is she knew the trans. # for both, but couldn't find confirmation #. What??!! How can you lose info. In less than 1/2 hour???!!!\nI checked next day, online to visa....charges have been posted, but no credits! I have visa now taking these amounts for scamming and dispute!\nThis whole mess held me on the phone and wasted my time for over 3 1/2 hours.\nThey said they refunded, but they didn't!\nThis was a band of thieves working inside..all together!\nNEVER again will I trust this company, AND I will go on Facebook and tell ALL my friends and public about this thieving company. Furthermore we will involve the police where this company is located...\n.$1100.00 to steal hard earned money is a lot!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T17:52:01.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

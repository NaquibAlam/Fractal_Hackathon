The return price was 481 GBP. I did not receive a confirmation email. I rang them and they sent me another but I still did not receive it (not in spam or junk folder) so they resent it to another email account. To my horror, the price said that 1503.48 GBP had been charged.\nI rang again and they gave me 2 options. 1) They would cancel the flight and give me a full refund but I would not receive this for 5 to 15 working days AND THEY WILL CHARGE ME A 20 EURO HANDLING FEE or 2) Give me a ful refund as a voucher so that I could rebook the flight AND USE THE REMAINING 1220 GBP to BOOK FLIGHTS WITH THEM OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.\nDo they really think that I would want to go to them for any further business? What about money to live on for the rest of the month? I am speechless! A disgusting and immoral business. Don't tell me about company policy! You messed up royally and I have to pay for it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T20:38:39.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I ordered a boiler service with Energia. I would say that the service was the bare minimum passable, as in the service engineer ticked all the boxes but whether or not any verificaiton of the items were done is unknown. The date of the service and the sign off date were different and neither were the correct date.\nFinally I ordered the service with free Netatmo thermostat and I didn't receive, moreover the service engineer didn't have one but advised that Energia would be contacted to send one out. Needless to say I wasn't sent one. When I phoned Energia to express my displeasure I found the service to be equally poor and when I asked to be contacted by a manager, lo and behold, I haven't received a call either.\nEnough said. I will be changing my utilities provider promptly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:25:36.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

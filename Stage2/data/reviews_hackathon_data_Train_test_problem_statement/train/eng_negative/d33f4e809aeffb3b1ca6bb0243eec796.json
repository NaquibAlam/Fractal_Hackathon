However, their internal web system was rejecting the purchase (not my bank, their website! Seriously?!). The result of that was that they charged on my card the purchases (three attempts) but then they were refunding me those same purchases. However... they were not refunding me the whole payment. They owe me like 5 bucks for each of the purchases that were refunded!! I contacted them about this but havenâ€™t received any answer.\nFinally, I paid with PayPal and the thing was flawless...\nWill I get my money back?\nUpdate: (I cannot reply to their reply but I can edit my own comment)\nThey said that all three orders were refunded. This is true. The problem is that the money refunded does not match the money charged. Funny, right? Not so funny after all. They still owe me more than 15 euros. Instead of contacting me they post this reply saying that all three orders have been refunded, giving the impression that the problem has been fixed when it's not true.\nIf you want to deal with this people you have to always use PayPal, otherwise their \"system\" will think that you are committing a fraud. The first thing this ever happens to me.

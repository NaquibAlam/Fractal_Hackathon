All the places we went to were amazing and worth experiencing with your own eyes.\nSomehow Goway Representative Kathrine didn't impress us much as we being vegetarian all the excursions book through Goway had no knowledge our dietary restrictions. None of the hotels Knew that we are the group same none of the excursions knew we are group so we all have to confirm seperately. We could have taken later flights, if we knew hotels check in time is 3 p.m. and we arrived at the hotel at 10:00 a.m. and had to leave 5:00 a.m. that morning to be at the destination by 10 am and hotel not available upon arrival. Really poor planning on her part.\nFood choices not confirmed 6 people\nHotel not under group reservation 16 people\nFlights not co-ordinated 16 people\nI think Katherine has no experience in group reservations or looking into clients best interest.\nJust not happy with Go-ways Australia and New zealand Specialist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:58:17.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

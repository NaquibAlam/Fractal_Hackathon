When I checked my bank account the money has come out and I have been charged for a flight but have no booking!! I have tried ringing the number that is on the website but it does not work! I tired the UK number and that too does not work. I have sent emails but have had a random reply that does not help me and noone has tried to ring me. I cannot believe that a company can have service like this. I cant even speak to anyone to get my money back! This is so frustrating!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:25:18.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

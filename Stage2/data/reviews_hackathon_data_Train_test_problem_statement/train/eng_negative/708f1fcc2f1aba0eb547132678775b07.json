For braking, I ended up moving my pedal input indicator on the HUD right above the rev counter so I could see my braking input.\nI installed the load cell and ended up removing it in the end. Too much force was required to brake that I ended up feeling uncomfortable in my lower back. The difference between braking really well and really badly was literally millimeters of movement so I figured removing the cell, using the input indicators from the HUD and having full range would benefit me more and in my experience, it has.\nMaybe there is something I have not done correctly? When calibrating the pedals I initially depressed them 0-100% which require a lot of force. After that I would depress them to a comfortable pressure like 0-50% but again, I am limiting my range and that difference between good and bad was extremely small. In addition, trail braking was completely wiped off the table for me with the load cell.\nIs it just not for me or have I done something wrong?\nEverything else was excellent about the service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T10:41:13.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

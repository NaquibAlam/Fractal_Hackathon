As we continued through the process it never gave a place to enter the code. I called customer service 30 seconds after I booked it and was told first that I missed it and they can't go back and credit it. After explaining there was no place she said she could see it when she looked. After explaining again it wasn't there she put me on hold for a long time. (hoping I would hang up I am sure) At that point she came back on and said that code had expired at some point. I explained even at that point it was still listed on the web page and she said there was nothing she could do about it. I have used Bookit before without issue so I am very unhappy with this customer service and will look else where next time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:12:51.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

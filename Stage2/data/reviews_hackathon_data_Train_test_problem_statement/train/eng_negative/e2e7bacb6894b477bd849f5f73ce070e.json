I am being told they are doing a special promotion and will use \"staff\". The salesman was the manager of the shop in london near bond station. I noticed that he asked me from where I am from, once I mentioned I was not from here (so not local) he became extremely persistant and persuasive. I feel they are targeting tourist. I finally bought product for 400Â£. Then, 5 minutes after I left the store realized that it was a mistake. I do not know those product, looked at the internet and realized that it is definitely not worth the money. I felt been manipulated and trapped. I went back to the store for a refund. I have been told yes it is possible you have to contact the email on the receipt. I asked how will I take back the products then, he said you will come back in store with a number code for refund. I have witness of this. I sent an email and am being told that they are not doing refund only exchange. I am extremely frustrated but this situation. I want to escalate this and will do the necessary step. If someone has the contact information of the CEO (mr. Deville seems to have been in touch with him) or any phone number please can you kindly share. Most importantly I would recommend to everyone to avoid this untrustworthy company. Their selling techniques are very aggressives and the customer service dishonest. If you have any advice please let me know.

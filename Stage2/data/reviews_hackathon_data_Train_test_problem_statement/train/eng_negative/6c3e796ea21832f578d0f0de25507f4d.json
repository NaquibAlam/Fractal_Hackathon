Most of its vendors/service providers despise Groupon because Groupon takes a huge cut from them for bringing customers to the business. As a trickle down effect, some of these vendors offer sub-standard/second hand service to the Groupon customers. Groupon also hardly vets businesses and whether the business is even open for service at all.\n2. So when a customer who has a bad experience or has a worthless trip to use the purchased voucher contacts customer service, they go for another bad experience! First of all, there is always a long wait. All customer service folks have a standard, pre-formatted reply. They do not even read the complaint transcript (instant chat) or complaint email. In most cases, however, their standard response is that some (non-existent) committee at Groupon would look into the matter and someone would get back to you in 3-4 business days. However, nobody ever contacts back and you are left to contact Groupon again and wait in the long queue.\nA Groupon experience is a hit or a total miss depending on your luck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T13:40:08.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

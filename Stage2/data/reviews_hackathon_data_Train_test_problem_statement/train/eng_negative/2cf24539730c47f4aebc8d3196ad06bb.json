Then the frustration of the stays does not afford an opportunity to change easily or contact a staff member without headaches beyond belief!\nThe carrier Iberia and Iberia express gave a less than satisfactory experiences on many points. It had three service staff members that were the saving grace for the lack luster performance and service from the other staff like no tomorrow!\nThe lack of knowledge for a service that is offered on the airline makes the choice of the air carrier nauseating. Not being able to reach anyone with the carrier or the travel booking made it a nightmare on return!\nI have had far better bookings with Opodo and better head's up on the actual time line before hitting the purchase button. But I will blame this error on myself for not paying closer attention to the fine print though on review the timeline was not clear from +1 day really should read + 2 days", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T20:32:18.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

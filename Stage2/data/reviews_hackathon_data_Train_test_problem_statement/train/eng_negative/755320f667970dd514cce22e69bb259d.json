I was promised a refund in December for a flight where the airline refused the passenger. Both the airline and Travelgino confirmed I would receive the refund, however, since then they've said this is not possible, and that \"the airline is refusing it\". I've called the airline several times and they've told me this is simply not true, and that travelgino is the one not processing the refund. When I've asked for proof of refusal from the airline, they've been unable to provide it.\nI will never book with this agency again, nor will I recommend it to others. I have been incredibly disappointed with what I believe is deceitful behavior of the business and a disregard for customer service and honesty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:25:47.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

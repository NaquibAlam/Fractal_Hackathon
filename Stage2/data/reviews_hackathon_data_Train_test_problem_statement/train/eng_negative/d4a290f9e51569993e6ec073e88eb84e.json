I ordered a case that had stars on a clear backrgound. But in real life the transparent looking background was UGLY and white (not at all transparent)! The case itself was cheap and tacky. The print is PIXELATED and NOT glossy like it claims to be! I can't believe I paid $50 Australian dollars for this.\nSo i contacted them wanting a refund, which means I have to pay for return shipping, which I was unimpressed about! So they organised a replacement free of charge.\nThe second time around I ordered something with a full print, so they won't be able to screw up and send me a white background when it should be CLEAR! But of course they screw up again and this time send me an iPhone 6 case NOT iPhone 7! I have just sent them a message again letting them know they have sent the wrong item. What are they going to do this time, send me another case? Maybe third time is a charm!\nONLY BUY FROM THIS SITE IF YOU WANT TO BE DISSAPOINTED!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:26:35.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Also was an investor in Microsoft.\nOccasionally I use it to call/text mobile numbers, but not every 180 days and here lies the problem. The credit expires. Isn't that nice for your balance sheet and horrible for the customer? I have to go through an activation hoop, if I have time/notice that my 3.22 cents is expiring within another 180 days.\nYou are burdening happy customers with mindless games to save transfer balances from customers to your balance sheet. How about entrusting your product team to create features that people will happily pay for instead of features that finance/senior management want to show shareholders quick wins.\nDevesting in Microsoft.

From the package being sent to a totally different address and individual and then the post office from that location constantly contacting me as they were trying to get it delivered to me, which I did appreciate. Then I received an additional item, as the company did send out another one to me, and that I also appreciated as well, but what I did not appreciate was when I notified them that I received the original item before I even got the one that was on it's way, the representative that has been emailing me regarding the issue told me to ship it via USPS, indicating that I pay for the return shipping, which I emailed her back and stated that I would not do such a thing as the entire debacle was no fault of mine, and I requested that they provide me with a return shipping label. The nerve of that was beyond me. I would shop elsewhere where there are less hassles. I even asked for a discount or promo code and she said no. Glad the ordeal is almost over. The item was not worth the headache at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:09:55.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Shortly after I placed the order I received email that the oven lid was out of stock and my order would not be shipped until it came it. I waited a couple days to respond, just in case the item came in and the order was shipped. Then I responded to the email to just ship the Pax 3. I received a response with a \"case number,\" but no actual response to my email. Again, being a patient person, I waited a day, but since I was on a gift deadline, I then used the chat function to contact them. The agent, of course, was very nice and told me the Pax 3 would be shipped right away. Nope! After waiting 24 hours, I contacted them again via the chat function and was told it had not made it for that day's shipping. Since it was Friday, that meant it wouldn't be shipped until Monday -- two days before I need it. The agent was able to get the shipping upgraded to express, so I MAY get it before the birthday -- we'll see. And then I got this email asking for my opinion.

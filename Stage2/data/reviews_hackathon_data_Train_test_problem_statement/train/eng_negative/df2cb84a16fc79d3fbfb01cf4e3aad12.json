When I returned and was ready to purchase, the salesman mentioned the same exact price. As I am reviewing my receipt after my $2700 purchase, I notice that the mattress was priced higher. When asking the salesman about it he said there was nothing he could do, it was a system glitch. But, on my receipt it clearly listed the retail price and then the price that it was sold to me for was HIGHER! He clearly should have fixed the price but he seemed very uninterested after he made the sale. I will let everyone around know about their pricing tactics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:26:38.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

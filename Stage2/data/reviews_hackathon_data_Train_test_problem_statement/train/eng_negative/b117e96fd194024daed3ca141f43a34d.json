No attempt was made to phone, leave a card, or email.\nThen when it wasn't delivered by the due date 27 Jan, I phoned JS and advised that the place was a residential and there was someone at home the entire time a delivery still did not occur until 8 Feb....and then it was put in the mail box....without any effort made to knock on the door...again someone was home. In the interim JS had said oh dear we tried to follow up and if you were in Chch we would hand deliver...but didn't feel as if they were really interested. So perhaps they could do the job in Chch but I wouldn't rely on them for Auckland deliveries. When they missed the deadline I wanted to cancel the delivery but they ignored and never followed up to see if it was delivered at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:42:01.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

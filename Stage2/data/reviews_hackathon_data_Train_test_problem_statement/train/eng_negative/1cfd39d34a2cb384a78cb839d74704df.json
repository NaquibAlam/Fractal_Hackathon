When I received my email confirmation I noticed an extra $140 charge for Manulife insurance. My husband said he noticed the same thing happened to him when he booked an earlier flight. I called and the lady was super polite and helpful. She said the charge can be reversed within 48 hours, but would take 10 days to be refunded. They told my husband they would do it for him as a one time courtesy. what?? I checked online with WestJet and their prices are the same. I have to ask myself, why would I go through the trouble of using Flight Hub?

The setup worked good and all, but later I found a cheaper option. But, was unable to contact go daddy support until this morning because there chat is always offline and I will not call. Once I finally got a support agent (After 20+ minutes) I told them that I want to request a refund and they verified my account and then told me that I COULDENT get a refund because it was over 48 hours... I have now cancelled my service, and my PayPal payments and moved my email back to my original provider. Very disappointed and will not do business here again. (Just a note, the office 365 services here cost $10 PER MONTH while Microsoft WHO MADE office 365 is selling services for only $4 per month...)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T15:38:32.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After layaway was paid off the bed that we had on layaway for our daughter we were told was no longer available. After a few weeks of having them tell us oh it was ordered it was ordered we still had nothing. We had to go all the way to Charleston South Carolina from Columbia South Carolina which is an hour and a half Drive each way. Once we picked up the bed we got it home and started to put it together and realize they were quite a bit of broken parts. We had to eventually contact corporate just to get anything done about this. The only way I would ever use American Freight again as if I have cash in hand and I'm ready to buy it right then and there other than that never again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:14:05.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

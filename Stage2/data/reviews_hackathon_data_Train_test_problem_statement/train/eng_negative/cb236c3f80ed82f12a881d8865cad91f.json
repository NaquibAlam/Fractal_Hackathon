It was clean with comfortable beds and appeared to be everything we wanted. However, after a day enjoying Madrid we returned to our apartment for a much needed good night of sleep. This was not to be.\nThere is a huge issue with noise with the apartment we were given.It does not affect the whole block. No sound proofing is in existence and this is our complaint ). Friends of ours were located facing onto a small courtyard at the rear and slept with no noise interference whatsoever.\nBy contrast we had enormous difficulty even getting to sleep. The street our apartment overlooked had constant pedestrian traffic. It had little vehicular access so is the main thoroughfare for pedestrians in the area. This is is not clear in the description on the website. We are reasonable and do not expect zero noise in a city centre apartment. In the last 6 months we stayed very centrally in Rome and Tallinn. We had some noise but nothing on this scale. I will now describe a night in the apartment:\n1. Constant background noise - as large numbers of people use this thoroughfare to access nightlife in the area(the first time last minute .com made us aware that we were staying in the one of the liveliest night streets in Madrid was on one of the many calls I made whilst in Madrid -a representative said words to the effect of \"what do you expect, you are one one of the busiest night streets in Madrid'. We NEVER would have booked had we known this. Last minute .com did not share this information until we were already there.\n2. This background noise steadily increased from midnight onwards as groups of young people became more inebriated and rowdy. We estimate we finally got to sleep around 2am. We simply became used to a level of noise.\n3. At around 3am drunken groups processed along the street singing and shouting. Motorbikes were ridden up and down. We were woken by this.\n4. At around 4am an extremely loud alarm went off - and stayed in this state for around 20 minutes. We were woken and that was the end of sleep for the night because...\n5. Street cleaning commenced with jet washing, bin hauling, street cleaners shouting to each other.\n6. We were still awake at sunrise.\nOur grounds for complaint:\na) we were not told that this street is probably the biggest night-life street in Madrid. (Until here). We would NEVER have booked this for us and our two children.\nB) no attempt had been made made by the proprietor to sound proof. There is a wooden shuttered door to the Juliette balcony, with single glass panels in it. Noise from the street travels straight through, as if we were staying in a garden shed on Leicester Square in London. Other properties on this street used for residential purposes are double glazed and then a second layer of double glazing in the form of an additional patio door arrangement over the top. In other words four times the noise protection.\nC) I rang last minute.com at around 7am on Saturday 11th march advising of problem and requesting a resolution as we have 2 children and we're only in Madrid for 2 nights.\nWe were promised a call back by 10am local time. We ended up calling last minute.com ourselves at around 11:15. This call went on for around 40minutrs at our expense. We were told (and this always seemed to be the excuse) that they had tried to call to no avail. Nobody else has had any problem getting hold of me there.\nThe employee told me that the local agent would contact me and I would have to sort it with them. I refused as my contract is not with the agent. It was with last minute.com .They made the contract with the agent for inadequate accommodation. I did not.\nI made the point that much of my short time in Madrid was now feeling stressful and I wanted to know we could all sleep well tonight so I requested it sorted asap.\nThe operator called me back 4 hours later to tell me that he couldn't promise anything but I neeed to talk to the agent. He said they were offering 15% discount. I refused this as I wanted to be rehoused as we desperately needed some sleep.\nI requested that last minute.com place us elsewhere. I was told that the person that I was speaking to did not have the authority to do this. I asked to speak to his superior who informed me that he would escalate my complaint. At this point I felt frustrated. I knew night time was approaching and we would be facing a night of no sleep once again. I knew it would be difficult to find somewhere else to stay if it was left too late.\nI was promised a call back (but was told it might not be the same day(!)) .\nThe call finally came around 5pm and we were told that last minute.com would not move us (however they tried to tell us this was the fault of the agency) .\nWe were made to an endure a second night of virtually no sleep.\nmy husband travels extensively with his company. As a family we travel abroad 3-5 times per year. We have never had an experience like this. We have done our utmost to sort the issue but with no support from last minute.com.\nWe were given an apartment not fit for purpose. You cannot sleep in it at night.\nIt is like sleeping (from a noise perspective) on a busy street next to a night club.\nIt is ideal for partygoers who wish to party to the small hours and sleep during the day (noise is substantially less in daylight hours!). The apartment description does not make it clear that apartments at the front are subject to constant crowd noise through the night and are unsuitable for those who wish to sleep at night.\nHugely disappointing experience.\nI am still hoping (but doubtful)last minute.com does something to rectify its shocking treatment of a family. Particularly it's attempts to direct complaints towards the third party agency instead of dealing with it themselves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T22:49:47.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was suspicious of the car rental price, as it seemed too low, and I contacted them the next day to query it.\nI was told there had been an error, and that the car rental price was incorrect (and utterly excessive). I asked whether I could cancel the car rental and continue with the flights, and was told that was not possible. I requested that the booking be cancelled, and told that my money would be refunded.\nI set out to purchase new tickets. Foolish me.\nI have now had two phone calls from people telling me the flights have been confirmed, and subsequently I have emails telling me I will be refunded tuppence ha'penny for the car rental, but I have paid for flights I no longer need, despite having requested the booking be cancelled. I doubt I will see any of my money back.\nAvoid. Just buy direct from the airline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T20:29:35.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

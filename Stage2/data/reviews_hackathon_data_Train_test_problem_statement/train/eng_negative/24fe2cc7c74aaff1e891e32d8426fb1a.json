It took a long time to arrive. When it did, The elastic installed on each end to hold papers, was not on the desk. I had a laptop desk like this for years and used the elastic bands continually. I'm disabled, cannot walk, and use the desk in my power chair and my recliner for personal business, paying bills, etc. It's almost impossible to use the lap desk without the elasfic bands, as nothing holds papers down, then. Easy Comforts has not answered my emails about the missing elastic bands., and I do need them. The bands are clearly showing in the photo of the desk in their catalog. I'm very disappointed in Easy Comforts, and will be returning the desk for credit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T10:08:08.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

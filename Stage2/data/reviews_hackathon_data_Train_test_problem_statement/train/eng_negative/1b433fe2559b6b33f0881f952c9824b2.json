To find a way to get to them takes away all your patience. I am a new customer and trying to redeem a voucher. Also I closed my account with G3 telecom services to sign up with rebtel. I used 2 vouchers and none of them worked. I was without any telecom services for about a day and I had to call my parents in India. They provide expired codes to our company maybe so that people like us would sign up for an account and then bam! That is it, you don't get any credit against that voucher. I had to flip through the FAQs, read help articles and then they thought they had their fun so after 15 minutes of struggle the website gave me chat option. I still wasn't losing faith in them. I talked to an agent and he was rude and absurd. I even told him how important it was for me to make a call to India. He was totally helpless and I don't even think how to treat customers. He didn't even what I was talking about! When I thought he is not helping me out, I rated him 1 star and ended the conversation. He came back to me saying I was rude for giving him 1 star and that he was thinking of giving me some credit. That was unacceptable since I did not want to talk to him and ended the chat, he had no right to reopen the chat and send me messages. Also there is technically no way that you can end a chat except by closing out the website!!! I would suggest them to hire more polite reps and also train them to help us out better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:07:12.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

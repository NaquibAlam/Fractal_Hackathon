Went back last week for tickets on a different trip. Agent found a stunning deal; $1600 off what airline was showing. I emailed back to hold and obtain the link to confirm and pay. Got busy with work and realized next day I had not heard back from agent. Forwarded yesterday's email and agent said he never received and deal was gone. Best deal he could obtain then day was a paltry $99 less than what airline was offering. A month ago, as a first time customer I received telephone calls as follow-up to ensure I had all the info and knew timelines were running out; this time totally ignored and it cost me a $3200 additional for two tickets. Too bad the same agent (Arthur) didn't do the same follow-up as when I was a new customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:12:32.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

However, this last order was not so good. Groupon doubled my order and charged for the doubled items. When I tried to email them to get it straightened out, I found that there is no way to reach them. Their website has a place to hit to get help but it does not work. I wasted a long time trying to find alternatives to no avail. I am so disgusted with Groupon that when a friend said to check Google for a phone number (which I did) that I just decided I did not want to deal with them at this point. Having issues dealt with should not be hard to handle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T13:53:07.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It finally turned up after a week, with scratches on the frame. I was offered a light and lock kit as compensation.\nThe pump I purchased is for Presta and Schrader, I was unable to get it to work (probable my fault) I borrowed a friends presta pump and had no issues\nOnce i finally had my bike assembled, I pumped my tires to 90 psi (the tires are rated to a 110psi max) and as i was putting my helmet on standing next to the bike, the tire exploded (i think i gave a few people a heart attack)\nI sent photos in of the damaged tire, and reid aggreed to send me new tube. I suggested sending it with the other items they were sending for compensation of my scratched frame.\nI waited a week for a reply (and sent another email propt) before calling as I had not heard, nor received anything. The excuse I got could be summed up as \"we forgot\" and they told me I can just go to the sydney store to pick up my stuff (defeats the purpose of ordering online)\nAt this stage I would just ask for them to send out a courier to pick up the bike and I'd take my money back. But after dealing with just the simple process purchasing the bike, Im not sure I would want to put myself through trying to get a refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T14:27:39.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

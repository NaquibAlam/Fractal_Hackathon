Instead, it was approximately 12 kilometers from Fort, which required long rides and of course additional costs. Breakfast (light one) was supposed to be included in the price but Ashan said that I could not expect that for the paid price. No toilet paper or soap in the toilette. Also no hot water (but that was not promised). The room is extremely noisy due to proximity to the busy road so I hardly could get any sleep. His mother also rounded up the price so I paid slightly more. Overall, very unsatisfactory experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:02:24.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I ensured that they were ordered in good time for such a busy day.\nIt was extremely disappointing to arrive home after work on the 13th to find that the flowers had been delivered around 9:30am on that day. Not only that the flowers began to wither and die within two days. My son bought some flowers for his mum on the 14th (a lot cheaper) and they are still going strong.\nI contacted the Prestige Flowers regarding this, and whilst they were apologetic around the delivery and offer of Â£10 voucher (to be used with their company), I felt it to be totally inadequate and unacceptable as I would not be using them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:49:20.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Their site has technical issues and the \"opportunity\" I was given was either bogus or poorly screened. When I tried to voice my concerns to them, they responded with a canned answer. Terrible. I've also taken the time to check out their Facebook page and find it unethical that one of the founders of the company has given Sortlist a 5-star review. If you're a client I suppose you'd have nothing to lose. If you're an agency thinking of testing a new way to conduct business development, stay away from Sortlist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T04:46:16.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They said it might be delayed as much as a week. A week later, still no package, I wrote again and this time the customer service reply was that the order was lost in shipment. I replied that if they could expedite a reorder I would do so. If not please refund my now 5 week old payment. The very next day I received another customer service note this time stating that the order was delayed. At this point, I do not know what to believe but certainly am not inclined to ever do business with them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:45:19.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

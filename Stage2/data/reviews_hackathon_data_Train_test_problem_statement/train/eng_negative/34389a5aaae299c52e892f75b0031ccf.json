Four months ago after a lot of back and forth finally got them to replace it. We picked out new furniture witch was a special order. It finally comes in and during delivery and set up the couch wouldn't go through the door and was damaged. I was told someone would call in 15 minutes and after 45 i called was on hold for 15 minutes and was told to wait another hour to talk to a manager. Now they have to come pick it back up evaluate the damage disassemble it and bring it back and reassemble it in the living room ($150 charge). It will take 3 days if they can repair it or up to 8 weeks if new material has to be ordered. So i have no couch still. This will be the last time i buy from gardner white.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:34:41.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I am 61 and have never been bullied before. Resulted partly from poor superviision of group on WA trip. Half the group had been together on previous trip. No one was introduced on trip I was on and guide changed half way through trip. I had a miserable experience and will never do another Intrepid trip in Australia. I have previously had very positive experiences with Intrepid in vietnam and exodus in Italy.\nFood was also poor on WA trip with first guide disassociating herself from any cooking duties. Group dynamics took over and result was unpleasant. NB I am a print journalist with 40 years professional experience and used to mixing with people of all ages and from all walks of life. I am gregarious and consider myself socially well adjusted. The only upside if the trip is that I now have increased empathy with those who are bullied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T09:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T17:31:14.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After my delivery did not show up in its allotted time I called Marley Spoon. I could not get through. I left a message on their voicemail. I was in a bind with going to work vs food sitting and spoiling in the sun so I wrote them an email and waited as long as I could before heading to work. That was Monday. It is now Wednesday. Our deivery was dropped to a house around the corner on a completely different street and spoiled in the sun. Such a waste, if they told me it had been delivered I might have searched for it a bit more. I have heard nothing from Marley spoon accept a notification that I have been billed another $55. Still waiting and look forward to eventually getting my money back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:43:49.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Had to check my credit card statement to confirm the transaction was completed. 2) Order was out of stock and back-ordered. Did not receive any notification of this. After waiting 2 weeks and not receiving any info, I initiated contact with Dyers via their Chat feature. Company rep informed me that the item wasn't expected to be shipped for another 2-4 weeks. 3) My credit card was charged immediately when I placed the order. Whenever this occur with ANY order, the purchase WAS NOT CHARGED until shipped. 4) In any other purchase that I have made through any other merchandiser, I have always been given the option to wait for availability or to cancel. In the past I have made a few other purchases from Dyers and I was completely satisfied. Unfortunately this transaction was very disappointing and will make me think twice before making a purchase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:40:43.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

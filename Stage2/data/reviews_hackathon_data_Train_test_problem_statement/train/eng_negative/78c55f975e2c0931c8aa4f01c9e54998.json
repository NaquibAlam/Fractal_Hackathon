When I try to read the contract it says \"Corbertura Super\" and I should of cause have asked what that was, but I am sure I never agreed to any extras!\nContacting Gold Car has made no difference. They answer polite but thats the only good thing to say about that...\nI have rented cars a lot of times, so I am not new at it. But this is the first time I have been scammed by a company. Not using Gold Car again, thats for sure!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T12:19:48.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Bravofly send a suggestion for a new flight, that was not acceptable. We tried to arrange a rebooking, but Bravofly was not able to arrange a new flight.\nThe communiation with Bravofly has been my worst customer service experience ever. Every time I spoke to them on the phone (charging 1 DKR / minute!) I got a different reply. Therefore, I decided to contact them on email instead – that did not help. Their response time was long and the replies not satisfactory.\nI decided to get a refund. Bravofly would only refund about 78 % of the ticket price. I have in several emails explained them passenger’s rights according to EU regulation 261/2004. They do not seem to care and are in violation of EU regulation.\nI am not finished with them yet, but I feel obligated to share my story, and hopefully others will refrain from any dealings with Bravofly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:40:42.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

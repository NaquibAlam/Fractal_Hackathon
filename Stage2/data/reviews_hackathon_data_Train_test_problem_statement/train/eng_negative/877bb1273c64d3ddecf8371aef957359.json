I contacted the hotline to request a more accurate delivery time . Unable was the reply ,. Well can you tell me the location of the truck so that I can get an approximate idea of delivery schedule . Sorry we don't know that . Well can you phone the driver and ask him . No we can't do that either . Well 8pm came and went no delivery . At 9pm the website was updated informing me that the truck had broken down early in the day and there was to be no delivery that day I had remained at home from 8am to 8pm waiting delivery . No phone call , no email , no contact of any kind informing me that delivery would not take place that day . Despite contacting the helpline twice during the day .\nI was then promised delivery on Friday with delivery again sometime before 8pm .\nFoolishly after the debacle from the previous day I expected that I would be afforded some sort of priority or even the courtesy of a more accurate delivery time . Again after contacting the help line and voicing my complaint I requested that a supervisor contact me regarding my complaint . Not unexpectedly, the call back did not materialise .\n8pm on Friday came and went with NO delivery . So to date I have remained at home for 2 days for absolutely nothing .\nThis company cannot make deliveries\nCannot contact their customers\nCannot follow up on complaints\nCannot contact their drivers\nCannot track their vehicles\nJust what are they capable of doing ? Because they seem incapable of making a simple scheduled delivery\nSomeone in management really needs to shake up this business up because all that I can see is incompetence at every level starting with their core business .\nI cannot suggest strongly enough that you avoid this business at all costs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T08:22:45.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

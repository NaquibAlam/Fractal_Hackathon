The maintenance station did something strange so it needed repairs as well. Sent the machine in, paid 1/2 upfront for repairs. It took me a month to come up with the other 1/2. Once paid, I was promised my machine w/i a week. Anajet shipped it to the wrong person. It took a month after that for me to get my machine back. While I wanted some financial compensation for all of the money lost, the committee thought it was fair to give me\n$1000 in products and extended warranty. Not what I really preferrred. I missed the entire month of December for sales (huge for new business owner and retail sales), lost 3 clients, and missed four major festivals. After receiving my machine back this month, it appears as though the motherboard may need replacing. Something they should've seen before shipping it back to me. Now I have to ship the machine back for repairs. Spoke with manager for Tech Support. Super rude. He didn't listen to my concerns, immediately told me what he wasn't going to do. Missed out on doing business with two new customers, had to cancel photo shoot, and losing another month for business opportunities. This has been the worse customer service experience. I won't purchase my upgrade machine from Anajet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:49:46.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

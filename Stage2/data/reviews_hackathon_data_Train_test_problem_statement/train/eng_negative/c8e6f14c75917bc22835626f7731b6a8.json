It kept telling me that I was not the admin on my laptop. So I called customer support for some help. After waiting over an hour to talk to someone, the man told me that the warranty was expired on both of my products so he could only help me if I bought extra warranty. All I wanted was for him to tell me how I can make myself an admin on my own computer. No other company has ever made me pay extra money when I had a question about my product. This is absolutely ridiculous and I am completely appalled by the service that HP gives to their customers. I can guarantee that these are the last HP products that I will ever buy. I will be now buying from companies that are willing to answer a very simple question.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T17:18:02.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

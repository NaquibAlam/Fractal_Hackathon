I didn't move my belongings until a few days later and the lights were still out. The day I moved my things in I called at least three times to inform them that I was on my may (like I was informed to do) so that the lock could be moved from my unit, I called until I actually pulled into the lot with no answer. I walk in and \"the manager\" is there on her cell phone. Nevertheless; once we started to move my things in the elevator was broke and we got stuck a number of time. Moving can be stressful enough, but to have to store your belongings under these conditions are worse. The lights still aren't fixed a week later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:18:05.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

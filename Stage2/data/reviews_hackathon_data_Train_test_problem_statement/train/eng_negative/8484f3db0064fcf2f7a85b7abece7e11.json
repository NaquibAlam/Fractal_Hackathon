One for flights and the other for the hotel. I rang up to change the time of the return flight, everthing was resolved and i was told to expect an email with an alternate flight time which i could choose to accept if i wish. Two minutes later i receive an email cancelling my hotel! Less than a week before the holiday.. this took 4 days to resolve, many phone calls and wasted time. Eventually the original hotel deal was offered back to me but at a higher price! Unbelievable.... will never use last minute again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T19:13:18.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Ordered a gift for my in laws that live in NY on my credit card (I'm from Toronto). They charged me and sent me the confirmation. 3 days later they cancel my order without even confirming with me! After they took my money!\nTried calling them, asked when they cancelled they said something about fraudulent activity, and how they can cancel any orders they want. No apologies no nothing! In fact their reps were very rude and didn't care at all! I lost money on the exchange rate and my time trying to uncancel the order. Didn't get my gift in time for my in laws either. Huge dissapointment and probably the worst customer service experience!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:46:13.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

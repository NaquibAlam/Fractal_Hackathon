The vehicle was spotlessly clean and we were very pleased with the service.\nThings went rapidly downhill from this point onwards.\nWe had booked a pick up from our hotel in Buenos Aires for four passengers with four suitcases. We also had hand luggage which sat on our laps for on our previous transfer from GIG. Our arranged pick up time was 11am. At 11.15am I sent an email to ziptransfers requesting an urgent response as our taxi had not arrived. I've never received a response to this email! At 11.25 the driver arrived. He had no identification and his car appeared to be unlicensed as there were no plates to indicate that it was an approved vehicle. The driver was unapologetic and in fact quite rude as he immediately indicated that he wouldn't fit our luggage into the car. I went with him to look at the car which was a Renault Fluence - a standard saloon car with a very small trunk. I explained that the transfer was for four people with four suitcases but he shrugged his shoulders and appeared disinterested. He made a phone call to his company and then eventually passed his phone to me to speak to a customer service agent from ziptransfers who explained that the company had no other vehicles available and suggested that I arranged alternative transport.\nI asked the driver to attempt to fit our suitcases into the trunk and he could only fit two into the very small area. I took photos, as advised by ziptransfers and asked the hotel to call a taxi. One hour later we were on our way to the airport which is around a 40 minute drive from central Buenos Aires. Luckily the traffic was fairly light and we arrived within the required check-in time.\nOn return to the UK I contacted ziptransfers who have been very unhelpful and would not accept that the vehicle provided was too small. They have failed to confirm why the driver did not carry ID and have provided no evidence to confirm that the vehicle was licensed. They have insisted that the vehicle was big enough to carry four passengers with four suitcases - Quote:\n\" We confirm that the provided vehicle Renault Fluence is able to transport four suitcases of the maximum combined size of 140cm (height + width + length) in the trunk. As we have received the confirmation that your suitcases would not fit in the trunk of the vehicle, we have to assume that the suitcases of your group exceeded the allowed luggage restrictions of a maximum combined size of 140cm (height + width + length).\"\n140cm of a combined size - height + width + length is a nonsense!\nI have requested a copy of their formal complaints procedure and they have stated that an email to them is sufficient to instigate a thorough investigation of the issues we had raised- no policy or procedure has been provided.\nMy request for a supervisor/ manager to deal with my complaint has been rejected although I have been assured that a manager has checked that the complaint has been thoroughly investigated. A major annoyance is that ziptransfers have taken the word of an unreliable company and refused to accept the word of their customer.\nWe will not be using their services again and would suggest that anyone considering ziptransfers looks at other options as this company is extremely poor at providing a transparent service and they clearly do not value their customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T12:10:29.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

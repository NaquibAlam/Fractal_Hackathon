My expert was very helpful.\nRelly,\nThank you for the help on the car. I accept your answer. I would rate your help as very good. I would however say this website is very annoying and difficult to navigate. I clicked on the accept button but just got an error. I called customer help and left a message but they never returned my call. I think it is up to you to convince them to pay you. This website makes it difficult to set up a user name and password. It is often difficult to find the log in page. It is sometimes hard to find my existing question. The only way I can find an existing question is to cut and paste from the emails you send me. The site frequently prompts me to start a new question. Please pass along my concerns to customer service.\nThanks\nRandy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:58:32.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

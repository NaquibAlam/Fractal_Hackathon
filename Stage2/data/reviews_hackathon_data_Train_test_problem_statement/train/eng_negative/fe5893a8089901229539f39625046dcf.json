I'm well versed on setting these up and began installing the burner and other items that come along in the package on 12-17-16. I then moved on to opening the logs and immediately found damaged logs which appear to have been damaged by UPS during shipping. After evaluating the package I determined it was poorly packed, and there were no fragile stickers. I immediately tried contacting customer service by phone but they don't work on the weekends. I then called back and reached the sales team who provided me with their Customer Service Manager John Mera. I left a detailed message for John and asked that he reach me ASAP so we could resolve the issue before my planned family dinner. I also followed up with an email to John with the details concerning the damage and also provided photos. After talking with John he mentioned that because this appeared to be shipper damage that Star Fire Direct requires him to file a claim. This was obviously concerning to me as this meant it would take longer for me to receive good logs. I can go on and on with more details but this too is taking up my time. I found myself having to stay in contact with John by phone and email to ensure the logs I paid over $600 for where shipped to me. Throughout this entire process John assured me he would address the issue but never came through. I took time out of my day at work to email, call and check status. I finally received my logs on Jan 20th. In my opinion John should have shipped me new logs after receiving detailed pictures and written communication. Procedures are put in place to ensure people are not taking from you but should be put aside when the facts are right in front of you. I tried to avoid from writing this review but to this day John and Starfire Direct has not reached out to me to help ease the pain from this terrible experience. I will be following up with the manufacture as I have saved all emails and pictures to make them aware of how they conduct business.

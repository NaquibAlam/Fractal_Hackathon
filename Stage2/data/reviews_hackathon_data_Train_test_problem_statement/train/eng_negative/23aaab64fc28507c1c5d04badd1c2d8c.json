I have been trying to get hold of Nutri Adrenal Concentrate and Nutri Thyroid Gland Concentrate since November 2016 and was advised it would be in stock towards end February though it is still not available. I called in November and spoke to a representative who was shockingly rude and abrupt with me when asked why they were out of stock and when to expect to be able to place an order. If they are not in stock by end February I will have to try another trusted brand where hopefully their staff are not quite so rude and unhelpful. At present I would not recommend buying from them due to the unreliability and rudeness to theither customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T14:23:25.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

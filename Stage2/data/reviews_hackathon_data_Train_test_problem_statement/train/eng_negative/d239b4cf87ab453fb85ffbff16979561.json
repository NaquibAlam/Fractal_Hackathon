Not only is it not large but it was not professionally arrange. It was shoved down in the base and design like a spray the kind you would order for a funeral. The flowers did not look fresh nor did they look like the picture on the website.\nNo plant food was included. No note card included . Also I ordered a happy birthday balloon and instead got a valentine heart balloon. I am embarrassed that these were delivered to my mother for her birthday.\nAnd 4 customer service phone calls later I was offered to have the bad flowers picked up and new arrangements delivered. They seem to have an attitude and annoyed that I was complaining. Correct me if I'm wrong but this is suppose to be a professional florist so why am I giving a do over ? Frankly I just wanted a refund but after the drama i just cut My losses .\nJust won't ever order from here again.Wish I had researched first because I would have saw the thousands and counting of complaints and over the years forthis business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:01:26.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Let me explain... The window of opportunity for the customer to submit an actual reading is deliberately narrow in order to prevent the customer being charged a fair and actual amount. This overcharging prevents customers like me from switching because we suspect it might be difficult to get the overpaid money repaid and the confusion involved may mean that customers like me are out of pocket when the account is closed off. I suspect any refund to the customer of credit due will not be automatic and any refund/credit on the final bill must be formally requested from Energia. This is a process which most customers find to be \"more hassle than it's worth\", due to people having busy lives, meaning Energia would hold on to that money under the pretense that it would be credited to the customer's next bill (there won't be any \"next bill\"). This is a money-making strategy. I will change back to Airtricity as soon as I get a chance. Competitors are offering â‚¬150 cash back at the moment, not to mention that they're cheaper than Airtricity right now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T11:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T12:45:34.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

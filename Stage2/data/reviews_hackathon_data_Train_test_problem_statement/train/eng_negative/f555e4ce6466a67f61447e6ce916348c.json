My wife tried to order a vanity table from NFM assuming that the table will be delivered shortly, but was informed that it will take a month or so to get it. When she complained to the management regarding the misleading statements on the web no steps were taken to mediate the problem. The statement still shows on the vanity table purchasing option. The only difference is that she is blocked from purchasing items - she no longer can buy a table from them (it says that the item is not available in her region), so I have to purchase it for her. Bad style, Nebraska Furniture Mart: fix your site and start listening to customers rather than blocking them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T18:33:36.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

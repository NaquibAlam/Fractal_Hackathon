I know a lot of people who choose not to shop Fabletics simply because they don't want to sign up to be a member and be billed monthly unless they remember to skip the monthly plan. That is so ridiculous.\nUnfortunately, I became a member and don't want to cancel my membership just in case I decide I want to order product again because I am a fan of the leggings Fabletics made. I'm simply stuck with this membership until I can find a comparable product and finally cancel it.\nThe worst part of this whole business plan is that once a customer is stuck with a membership the products they have to choose from are always out of stock.\nAs I write this review I am actually questioning why I choose to remain a member. I will be cancelling my membership.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:50:45.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

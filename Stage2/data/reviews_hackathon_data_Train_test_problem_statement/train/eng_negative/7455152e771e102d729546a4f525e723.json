This I did not know until I was going to take the flight. So I had to buy new expensive tickets at the airport. Now 4 months later I still haven´t recieved my money for the new ticket I had to buy. I can´t talk to anyone who can make a decision over the phone, so I have to e-mail customer service. Their reaction time is always minimum 6 days. Bravofly acknowledged that they made a mistake, and that they will pay me, but they just don´t pay. Nothing happens. I can´t recommend to use Bravofly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:12:24.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

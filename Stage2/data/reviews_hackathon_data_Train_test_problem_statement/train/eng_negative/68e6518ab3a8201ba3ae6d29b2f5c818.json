On 2/13 I called to check the order status and was told the item was expected in stock today, 2/17, and it would ship then. Today (2/17) I received an email saying the order would not be filled and was cancelled. This was a birthday gift and the item is not available. If I had known 2 weeks ago, I could have purchased it from another site that had the item in stock then. Obviously, I will not patronize this company in the future. Fabulous customer service.

I contacted Flight Guru in turn said they contacted the hotel. That I cannot verify. For the whole of my trip I had no heating in my room and myself and child were sleeping in our dressing gowns. I have now contact Flight Guru about my trip since I have been back and told them that I was not satisfied with the treatment by the hotel and I would like to recoup some of the money. They have brushed my complaint off. They said they would get in contact with the hotel, I rang and chased and nothing has been rectified. I have heard nothing since.

Customer service team would not change my request and delivered to my home. The courier allowed a random neighbour to sign for the delivery. Offered to have store assembled but I had no way of transporting such a large item to their store. I had to assemble the bike myself, which was challenging as someone not familiar with the process. Terrible customer experience.\nEdit - Thanks for your response. All your comments are valid but the only call out I have for you is that your eBay page directs you to contact customer service to update the order for click & collect and also sets the expectation that orders takes 2 business days to leave the warehouse. In my case, your customer service group also made no attempt to try and contact the couriers and correct the order. I would suggest you look at updating your eBay sales pages to make it clear that you require this information to be entered in the order comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:21:43.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

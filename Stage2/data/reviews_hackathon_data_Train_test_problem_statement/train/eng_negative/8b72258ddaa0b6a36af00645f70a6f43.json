We would not be able to centralise the pattern in the middle as this would be difficult as we are unaware where the pattern would be cut once in the manufacturing process. However what we would be able to do is pattern match the blind, this would be an additional 10% per blind. This would not be a wall paper finish, but would ensure the pattern is consistent on the way up. If you can please give us a call on the number below so we can take payment and proceed with the order.\nBit confusing so I called them and was told they just take the next cut on the material to save costs and it would probably come out ok????However if I want to make sure the pattern is central it would cost me an extra 10% on the order price.\nI find this an incredibly sloppy way to run a business and would imagine most people would be unhappy with their order being made this way.\nI have cancelled my order and have found a local reliable friendly company who now have my money and my order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:07:10.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Basically, something happened to 70% of my large packages delivered by PostNL.\nExample one. I ordered online fragile dinnerware and paid EXTRA for evening delivery, to make sure I am at home, so that my package wouldn't go around for too long for another delivery attempt and something brakes. But the order arrived during the day when I was not at home despite the fact it was supposed to arrive after 6pm. Then they were driving it around for another 3 days(!) before it arrived to the closest post office from where I had to carry it myself (a very heavy package). And everything was broken inside by that time. Customer service told me I cannot even file a complaint, because I AM NOT THEIR CLIENT, but the online store is, and they are the only ones who can complain.\nExample two. I ordered something from another online shop, which was supposed to be delivered until 4pm on a Saturday. I didn't receive anything and was surprised to discover my delivery status in Track & Trace as delivered. Called customer service, and they just said it might be a mistake and I must wait until 6pm or if it doesn't come, another 5 working days (support specialist said it as if it is something normal and I am the crazy one here to complain). But of course the 6pm deadline was arbitrary since this is when the support closes and I cannot call back anymore for another day and a half. I didn't receive anything, even a note that it might have been delivered to my neighbours. T&T just says I got the package! This is unacceptable.\nOnline stores should all stop using PostNL (and some don't anymore indeed), because I got deliveries from various companies, and literally anyone is better than PostNL with their unprofessionalism and indifference.\nCherry on top. A few weeks ago I saw a PostNL employee pissing at our building's back door (which is extensively used & at the street where many people walk) in Amsterdam. I guess this is the only thing they are good at.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:43:40.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

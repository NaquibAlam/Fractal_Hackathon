However getting it delivered was a nightmare. I sent it to a post office as I was unable to send it to my residence. It turns out the delivery company Reid Cycles uses can't deliver to post offices which isn't stated anywhere on their website. So the bike wasn't delivered and was just sitting in a random warehouse. I\ncalled Reid a week after it was supposed to be delivered to ask what why it hadn't been delivered. Customer service was useless. They told me they would call me back if there was a problem. I didn't hear from them. I waited another week before calling the delivery company who informed me why they couldn't deliver it and that it was just sitting in a warehouse. No-one contacted me to tell me this. Presumably if I hadn't followed up. It would've sat there indefinitely. I then had to take time off work to pick it up from the warehouse as it was only open during business hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T12:21:24.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

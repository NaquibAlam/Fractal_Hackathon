Since I didn't have a printer to print out a prepaid return label, I was told to go to the library or my neighbors house and ask to use their printer. There wasn't anyway I could get a label sent to me in the mail. After getting the call escalated to a Supervisor, I was told I had to wait 24hrs to see if you could schedule a pickup. I also asked once the item was returned if they could just ship me out the correct item and I was told no, I would have to pay another $70 and order the item again. Well first of all, I won't get a credit for the item that was shipped incorrectly to me until 3-4 weeks, and who's to say if I will get the correct item if I order it again. In that case I will be waitin another 3-3 weeks for another refund, that's $140 and I still won't have what I ordered. I think that is such an inconvenience and poor customer service. I've decided not order the item and just wait 1 month for my refund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T14:00:59.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

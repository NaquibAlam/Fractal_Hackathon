Currently you have to create your order and then go back to your email and manually email them.\nMy may complaint is that I never received and email indicating the status or progress of my order. Have they received the order? Have they processed the order? Have the reviewing an verified the prescription? Have they shipped yet? What is the tracking number, etc?\nMy order ended up going to the wrong address due to his lack of communication.\nUPDATE 2/06/2017:\nI did find the emails in my spam box. However at the top of the emails was a message from Google indicating that they put this email in my spam folder because the sender is not following their guidelines on sending bulk emails. I partially blame opticontacts for this.\nIn response to opticontacts explanation on the prescription upload my answer is this: See how your competitor 1-800-Contacts does it. They allow you to upload the prescription right on their website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:36:02.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

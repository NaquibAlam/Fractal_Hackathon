Everything is fine at this point.\nHowever 10 days later they called to say the tickets are being refunded due to some flight cancellation (seems unlikely to me) and they cant give me alternatives because the price has shot up 10 days nearer the time so not surprising really.\nLots of bad reviews on other websites with them doing similar things. They have said they will refund but its now leaving me having to reschedule the holiday for a much higher price.\nMy flights were Taipei to Tokyo then to Shanghai for 1 night then to Taipei.\n*Update*- they did give me a full refund so re-marked as a 2*, however they weren't interested in trying to honour the existing holiday I booked with them nor helping me fine a replacement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T17:39:46.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

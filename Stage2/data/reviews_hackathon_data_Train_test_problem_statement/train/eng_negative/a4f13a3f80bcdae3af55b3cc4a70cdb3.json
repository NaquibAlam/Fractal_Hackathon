She did it through AllGifts and we received an email saying she had bought us a fifty euro tesco voucher which was so sweet. It was an email which had attached a PDF which looked exactly like a gift card. Said it was a gift card. So I went to tesco to try and use it and was told while trying to pay that the voucher code just looked like gibbledegook to the clerks. The AllGifts email was a gift card to use on their website in order to buy a tesco gift card..Which would then be delivered in ten working days. So misleading. Led to an extremely embarrassing situation. It is a hassle and a half to even work out the website and while they say it is possible to order it to collect, there was no option for me to do that with the tescos gift card. I'm just hoping that mine turns up now.. Not a great experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:15:31.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The woman at the checkout counter, was not. We were originally there to pick up Moana that i purchased online and qualified for a free flashlight. Because I also had a $300 purchase that night, I qualified for a free basketball. The woman at the counter acted annoyed, barely staid a word but have us dirty looks when we asked if we could get the flashlight and basketball. She turned and placed the basketball on the counter and said \"there you go\"...the first thing she said to us at this point. Then I asked again if I could use my coupon I received for the flashlight when I purchased Moana. She rolled her eyes, reached under the counter and placed a small box on the counter and said \"all we have is orange\" in a very rude tone. I said that was just fine, said thank you...with no response back and we walked away. I've never been treated more rudely there and definitely when I just made almost a $400 purchase after delivery fees. I will not return to the Murray location. I'll drive the extra miles to the Draper if I go back to RcWilley.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:20:09.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The cost for 11 days was equivalent to what I have paid for one day in another country. But I knew from previous experience that when I get there the agent will try to insist that my credit card insurance does not cover CDW in Ireland (it does) and when I insist he will tack on an extra charge for NOT taking insurance. However, in addition to these annoyances, reading the fine print before booking I learned that the agency at Dublin airport would charge an additional 30 Euro for the privilege of getting the car at the airport rather than downtown. This essentially doubles the cost. But worse was yet to come. When I made the booking regardless of this highway robbery, in the fine print on the confirmation I learned that there would be a SECOND 30 Euro charge added at the airport, essentially tripling the cost! There was no reasonable explanation for this second booking charge except greed.\nAll of this would have been known to Rentalcars.com and should have been prominently displayed at the time of booking so an informed decision whether to accept this highway robbery could be made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:20:23.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

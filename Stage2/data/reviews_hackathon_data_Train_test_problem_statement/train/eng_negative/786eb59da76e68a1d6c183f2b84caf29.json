INSURANCE ONLINE IN ADVANCE, AVOID THESE CRIMINALS! We booked online through Rentalcars.com , arrived Bcn airport, they have no cars at the airport, collection of cars involves a long convoluted walk outside and around various car parking areas in the heat to eventually find the Goldcar bus which drives you miles away from the airport to their secure compound in an industrial estate.\nAfter a long time waiting, watching other customers stressed, crying, being berated by staff, we were warned by other customers \"not to buy the extra insurance\".\nFinally got served by a very rude woman. Despite having paid for insurance online, she claimed that it was invalid as \"it wasn't their insurance\". Tried hard to get me to buy their insurance, €200 for 2 weeks cover! If not, we had to pay a €1200 deposit or we couldn't have a car. The day was getting on and we just wanted to get out of this stressful office with other holidaymakers upset, angry, being forced to pay for extras, we were miles from anywhere, managed to negotiate the price of extra insurance down to €100, and agreed to pay despite buying insurance online, I thought I'd just try for a refund on that post-holiday, we just wanted to get going. Turns out they want another €90 for fuel in advance? Does this little hatchback even take that much fuel? No way. Managed to negotiate the price down a bit, this is starting to get expensive but we've already paid for the hire online, we don't want to go through the rigmarole of cancelling, going back to Barcelona airport empty handed, to then have to go through the whole car hire process from scratch, they exploit this scenario at their secure compound, some people just pay up the extras so they can get on and not lose a day of their holidays, others leave upset, out of pocket, EVERYONE is stressed out, truly horrible experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:20:28.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

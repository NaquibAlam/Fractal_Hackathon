The best in fact which is why I went with it. Online method of contact - no problem with that being the companies' chosen medium of contact. However I am gutted with the service. After paying my fee online and receiving my disc promptly in the post I then received a request for my no claims cert- grand - sent it off. Also got asked for details of any accidents including non fault. Wrote a letter detailing 3 incidents where other drivers hit my vehicle in recent years. But- no claims were ever made by me on my insurance and the guilty parties always simply paid up. Cut and dried I would say. Twice I was told online I had not provided this info even though it was in the same envelope as my no claims cert which was received! Finally I'm told they did receive my letter but want dates and did my company ever pay out? All of this was in my actual letter which I had to post twice even though they got it the first time! When I wrote an imessage to say What They're asking was already answered in my letter and that I didn't appreciate the messing around they blocked my account! So I'll have no choice but to call which will cost â‚¬10 fee plus phone bill or cancel the policy. They have deliberately messed me around asking several times for the same info. So now I'm over my 14 day cooling period. Very clever cos guess what? once that happens they take 25% of your whole fee! Did I mention no-one even responded to me when I messaged that Im not happy to keep repeating myself with their info requests? They just went and locked my portal account. Way to go there with the awesome customer service. Here's the rub - neither I nor my husband have made an insurance claim in the past 16 years! Any insurance company at all would be delighted to insure me and I had the misfortune to select these charlatans. Never ever go with this company - the money saved is not worth the appalling experience. Would hate to see what happens when someone actually has an accident. I feel in my case this company are scam artists as they had no reason or evidence to not insure me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T23:08:49.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

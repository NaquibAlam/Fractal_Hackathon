I discovered Main Lobster Now and found their prices to be competitive or cheaper than most. I selected the items I wanted and placed them in my cart then entered my zip code to estimate the shipping cost. I was delighted to see that the shipping would be only $1.00, so I placed the order and received confirmation with a breakdown of the total cost.\nThe next day I got an email from their Customer Service Rep which stated that there was a \"glitch\" in their program and I needed to send them authorization to charge and additional $38.00 for the shipping.\nI felt that the \"glitch\" was their problem, not mine, and I was expecting them to honor my order as placed,with an explanation that all future orders would include the correct shipping rate.\nI do understand their point but I also feel, right or wrong, that they could have completed the order to pretty much ensure the loyalty of a new customer. I did notify them that for years I have place several orders a year but now will, most likely look at some of the other vendors for those orders..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:49:43.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

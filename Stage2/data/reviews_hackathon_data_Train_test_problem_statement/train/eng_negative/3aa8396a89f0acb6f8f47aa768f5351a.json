If you have an allergies to Fish product, you should not used Dior Snow skin care line. I told the beauty consultant that I have sensitive skin and she said I can still used it, \"it made for sensitive skin people's\". I guess not, since I when to Macy and ask and the other beauty consultant said that lady was wrong for saying that to me. From now on, I stick to my Dreamskin, it never led me down.\nThe worst part about ordering Dior directly online is that I have to pay for shipping to return it. It cost me more money out of my pocket and hassle than what it worth. From now on, I'm going to buy Dior at Macy instead. At least they have free return (hassle free).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:01:31.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

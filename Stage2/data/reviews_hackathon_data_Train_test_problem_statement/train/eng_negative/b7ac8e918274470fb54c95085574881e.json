I received a refund for posting it out Special Delivery but I have yet to receive payment for the ticket I sold. This was last November and I just keep being told that it is being looked into, and I never get a response. There is no number to call the complaints department direct. Ticketbis keep asking for my banking details and telling me they are incorrect which is why payment has not been processed. This doesn't explain why they have paid me back for postage but are struggling to make the payment for the ticket I sold.

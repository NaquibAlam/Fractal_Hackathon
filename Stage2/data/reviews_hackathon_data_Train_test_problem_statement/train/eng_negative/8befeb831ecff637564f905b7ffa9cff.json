Although I had ordered a VW Golf I was then told the only available car was a Honda Jazz. The lady said that it was to dark for us to inspect the car but to look at it in daylight and if I found any damage to ring up . I rang to say that there were lots of marks including a deep graze on the drivers side. I was told that my call had been logged.\nSurprise, surprise when I returned the car after 6 days and only 142 miles there was no record of my call and I was charged Â£995 for the damage.\nWhen I protested the manager said to me ' It won't cost you anything. You just claim it back on the policy you bought.'\nI wish I had read the reviews before using Green Motion as it seems they are not only rated the worst rental company of all but are well known for their sharp practices which are at best a scam and at worst insurance fraud.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T09:47:54.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

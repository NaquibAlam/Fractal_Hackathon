As I wanted to add an extra baggage to my booking things got complicated. I received an email from a staff member,a woman called Veronica,offering me two options for my additional service. I replied immediately, feeling confident that my request is being handled. But I was wrong-unfortunately. I didn't received any answers for a week and had to call the company twice to get a reply from them that my request is being handled! Now-6 days prior my departure I still have no clue if I can bring my extra baggage or not. Of course I send another email but as ussual-there was no reply. I will probably have to call the company again although they normally put you on hold for 10min or more...and then if you're lucky,someone answers.\nI have no idea how my flight will be,but this is the last time I booked my flight via Travelgenio.\nI have never experienced such ignorance from a flight agency in my life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T12:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:23:09.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

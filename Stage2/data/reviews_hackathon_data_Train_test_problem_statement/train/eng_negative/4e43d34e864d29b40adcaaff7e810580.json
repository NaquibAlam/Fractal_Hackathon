But the last one was pretty awful. The customer service here is indifferent. I needed to reschedule a flight bc of a family issue. No help given, the cost of the new flight was equal to the other flight and so I paid twice. Understand that this may be airline policy but the service was so unwelcoming and abrupt it was as though I was inconveniencing them. Booked and confirmed return home seat. Once at gate my seats were not only different but all the way at the back of the flight twenty rows further back than oriiginally. Directly across from bathrooms instead of a window seat. Customer service gain dismissive, gave me a $14 credit. Again not so much the details as the service itself, thoughtless and indifferent. Won't ever use this again. Stick with booking directly with an airline or hotel. This company sucks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:03:07.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

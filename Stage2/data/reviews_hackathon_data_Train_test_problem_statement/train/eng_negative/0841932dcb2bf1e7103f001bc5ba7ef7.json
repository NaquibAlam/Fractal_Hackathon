The next day the tracking showed the item was at my local depot, and stated \"Out for delivery\" at 7:33am. I signed up for email notifications and also waited at home all day, constantly checking the tracking info. There was no delivery or call or email and then at around 8:30pm the tracking info updated to say \"rescheduled\" for the next day.\nFrustrated, I complained to UPS customer help and the answer I got was that the item was not loaded on the van because it arrived after the van left (as if they have one van?). They then suggested I should pick up the item from the depot myself at 8:00am the next morning. I told them that's not possible, and besides I have paid £9.90 for delivery. I requested they should deliver my package by 12pm the next day and they refused to prioritise my delivery although they had already been late.\nThe next day the item was \"out for delivery\" at 6:00am this time, so I was more hopeful it would arrive. However, UPS failed to deliver again. I contacted customer support on twitter again after 10pm since the depot telephone lines close at 8pm. I got the response that the delivery can come at 7pm or later, and the current time is \"3pm\". I reminded them that it is actually 10:30pm where I am and that the item has not arrived. They then told me there will be another delivery attempt the next (third!!) day. This was originally for a NEXT DAY delivery!\nI am frankly astounded at the lack of service I have received for £9.90 for a 2kg parcel, and the fact that UPS customer service have not compromised or made any effort to minimise my loss by sending my delivery out on a priority after it was late.\nYou literally had one job UPS, and you failed to deliver. You not only have caused me distress, but wasted time dealing with this. I hope I will never have to use your service ever again, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:29:35.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

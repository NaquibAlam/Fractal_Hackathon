It was obviously a return item. The packaging was damaged and busted when opened the watch had been hurriedly stuffed in and the settings had been set before. To be fair i used the watch because i needed to and found it to be working ok but i would have returned it if it hadn't been required at the weekend..\nGerry\nSorry posted by accident.\nI know its not your fault but your courier service did not deliver the item. I followed the tracking service and they said they had attemped to deliver and i was unavailable at 11.04 am. The address i supplied is a school we were open i was available all day there was no card or notice left. I had to go to several locations to track down the order it was not at my nearest Post office. So as you can see my experience was not a good one and does warrant a two star rating.\nGerry", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:02:37.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

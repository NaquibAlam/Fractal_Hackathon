We turned up on the day all excited to begin our holiday only to be told there was no record of our booking. After wasting at least an hour and a half trying to contact someone from DriveNow we were told the vehicle had been cancelled weeks before but nobody from Mighty had bothered to contact myself or DriveNow. This was peak tourism time in NZ - no other campervans available. We had a hectic time trying to hire a car and find some accommodation, the whole day was wasted and this put a huge damper on our holiday. We were so disappointed. Not even an apology from Mighty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T06:50:09.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

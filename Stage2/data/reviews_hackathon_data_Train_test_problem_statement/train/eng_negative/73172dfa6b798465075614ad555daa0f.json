I was trying to have a discount applied that wasn't showing on my final check out price.\nI called and was on hold for over an hour, only to be hung up on. When I called back they said the gentleman who had been helping me went on break and that is why he hung up. The agent then could not help me after holding for 30 more minutes, said she would transfer me to a supervisor, who could not help me either. at this point i wanted them to honor the original price and they wouldn't!! After holding for over 1 and a half hours and with no resolution, I asked for a manager who did not help and hung up on me a second time!!\nI could not believe their customer service was so rude and terrible! I will definitely never recommend book it.com to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:35:27.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

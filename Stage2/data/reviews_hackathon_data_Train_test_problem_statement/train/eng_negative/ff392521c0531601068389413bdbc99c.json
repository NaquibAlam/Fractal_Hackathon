I used this business a couple months ago when I had to ship my belongings to my new place. When the packages were arrived, most of them had noticeable damage to even outside of the boxes, and it was no surprise that some pieces inside were cracked or completely broken. I contacted the customer service department, but they said that they wouldn't be responsible for any damage if I had personally packed my stuff. Half of the packages were heavy duty cardboard boxes to give extra protection for my stuff, but this horrible company wore, crashed and dented those thick boxes. I can't imagine how terribly Purolator treated my stuff during the delivery. If you are totally okay with spending extra money on repairing your broken stuff or purchasing a new one, and with being horribly treated by the customer service, this business could be one of your options. Otherwise, you definitely want to take your business somewhere else!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:38:33.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

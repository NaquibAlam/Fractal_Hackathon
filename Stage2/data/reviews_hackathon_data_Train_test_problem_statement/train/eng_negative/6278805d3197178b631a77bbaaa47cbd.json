Scarily had exactly the same and proved it to them. They just ignore all contact. Go to CAB or OFT\nContacted you at least 10 times and you just ignore my emails and won't speak to me!? Fantastic service! Can't wait till the OFT turn up and close you down.\n27/02 - still nothing from these jokers. Pretend to be interested then do nothing. Have claimed person you spoke to is in another team so please re-log all info and complaint. AVOID YOU WILL BE STUNG BY THIS COMPANY.\n01/03 Still nothing! To be clear this is 5 weeks now and not one phone call received or accepted and constant delaying tactics! Keep complaining to authorities people and use Chargeback via your Bank if you are not satisfied with work/fees charged. This lot won't be here much longer, they are being investigated just need more people to report complaints and provide the evidence of what they are doing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:54:20.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

On the weekend before my trip I received an e-mail telling me my booking was cancelled and my money was returned. No support to call on Sunday and my trip started Monday. Finally Monday I got contact from the help center and there was nothing they could do. So I had to call every where for a room before my flight left and of-course the Hotel I had booked previously was almost double the price. I had to change to another Hotel and still had to pay more than before. All this before my flight. I will never use this service again. No help on re-booking just \"uups were sorry\" I would not recommend using this service to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:35:14.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

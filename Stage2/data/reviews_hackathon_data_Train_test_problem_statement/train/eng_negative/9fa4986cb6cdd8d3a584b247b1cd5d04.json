In fact, even the host family had left for\nthe weekend and found it when they returned on Sunday, so noone was home, so not sure whether it was delivered Saturday or Sunday.\nThe postage cost was almost 50% of the cost of the product and it is unacceptable that the gift did not arrive as promised.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:45:11.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

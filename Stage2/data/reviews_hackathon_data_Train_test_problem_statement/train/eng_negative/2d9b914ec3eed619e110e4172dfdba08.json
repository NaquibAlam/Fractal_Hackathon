I got a reply back a couple of days later asking me to confirm several details about my order and once I did I asked to then wait another month and contact them again if the item hadn't arrived by end of January. I then contacted them again at the end of January which was over 2 months after I ordered from them and I was once again to confirm several details. After I sent them details for the second time I was told that because I didn't purchase insurance with my postage I am not entitled to a replacement or a full refund. I was offered a mare £1.25 on a £8+ item because I had used a voucher as part of my payment. I decided not to bother with that £1.25 and never to use this company again for anything.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:21:20.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

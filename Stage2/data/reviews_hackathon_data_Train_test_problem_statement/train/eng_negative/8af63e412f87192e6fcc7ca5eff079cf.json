I was given the ACH traceid numbers and after speaking to my bank and to ACH (I work for a bank so I can reach them easily), ACH doesn't recognise those ids and don't see any incoming transfer to my account for the amounts that I did. I've got to say that so far transferwise customer service is being very helpful but I need my money to close a mortgage and no one seems to know where the money is. Transferwise have reached to their banking partner so waiting to hear from them, but in the meantime there several thousand dollars that I need and don't know where they are. I hope that I can come back and rate the service as. I would have done a week ago.\nThanks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:56:18.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When he sees me he then tells my my brown hair is too dark for silver heighlights, I said I was told it would take a couple of applications but it was possible. He then tells me no I can't have it, this I don't understand as there are plenty of women with black hair and silver highlights. He then pushed twice for me to have my hair cut Eventhough I said I didn't want it cut. He then tells me I wouldn't have been able to have my colour done today anyway as it would take too long and I was late. All in all it was terrible service, I am now having my hair done at a different hairdressers who say the colour silver is possible for my hair. I couldn't believe they blamed me for being late when he was still working on someone else. Would defiantly not recommend these pushy and abrupt hairdressers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:59:52.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

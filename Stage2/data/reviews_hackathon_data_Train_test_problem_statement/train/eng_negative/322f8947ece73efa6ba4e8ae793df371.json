Have only spoken to her now (Feb), to find out if she liked her flowers - she never received them. On contacting FloraQueen their response was they won't accept any responsibility because their policy is I would have had to report non-delivery no more than 2 days after delivery date. These were an Xmas surprise, so I wasn't going to ask my mother before Xmas if she received them. I assumed she had - as she has every year when I've ordered through a reputable international florist.

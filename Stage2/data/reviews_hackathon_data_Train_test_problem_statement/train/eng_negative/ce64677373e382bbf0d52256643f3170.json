While searching for a flight, I was getting different prices on FlightHub depending on whether I accessed the site directly, or came to the site through another site. Then I realized... in some cases the FlightHub site was automatically changing my CDN dollar selection into USD even though it still said I was on the Canadian site AND THEY WOULDN'T LET ME SWITCH IT BACK (selection became grayed out)!! And the currency conversion was not even close to being fair. The price in USD was substantially higher than in CDN after doing the conversion. However, I almost booked the USD ticket thinking I was getting a savings since I thought it was in CDN dollars since i had selected CDN dollars. I saw the fine print stating USD at the last minute. I'll bet a lot of people get tricked because one gets excited when they all of a sudden see an unbeatable price.\nSo I reset everything and go to book the ticket in CDN dollars and it offers me seat selection. In addition to the cost of the seat from the airline, FlightHub wanted to charge me an additional $15.95 per seat (so an insane total of $45.95 per seat). I opted OUT of seat selection and get to the end where I'm going to pay, and lo and behold, even though I have not selected any seats, FlightHub has still added their $15.95 x 2 seats charge!!! I had to MANUALLY remove that charge just before paying after I had already opted out of selecting any seats earlier.\nThen I opted OUT of any promotional emails. Guess what? I received 3 promotional emails almost immediately after my purchase. I try to opt out AGAIN by clicking \"Unsubscribe\" and their site says I'm not even signed up!\nDeceptive pricing practices designed to trick people into paying more, dishonest bill padding after I specifically opted out of certain offers, and dishonest spamming email practices. All in all a crappy experience. I booked the ticket on the site because they offered a $40 discount as compared to booking directly with the airline. Had I been in a rush and unable to scrutinize every tiny little step, I would have been tricked into paying more. I'll bet a lot of people do get tricked. It's not easy to get one over on me, and they almost succeeded.\nNext time I'll just book with the airlines. I don't like it when companies try to trick me. Too much hassle with the booking experience, and too many ways to get tricked into paying more than the advertised price makes the whole experience risky and unpleasant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T09:20:49.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

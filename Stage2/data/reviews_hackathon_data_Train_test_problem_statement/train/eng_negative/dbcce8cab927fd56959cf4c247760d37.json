Original order shipped in an envelope, causing many of the five cartridges to be damaged, with ink secreting out of most of them. Company rep apologized, said that an envelope should not have been used for such a large order. Replacement cartridges shipped in a box, received late the following week, with three of the color cartridges still not working properly, oozing ink. Some cartridges did not match ... structurally different from each other. Bottom line: A poor experience. Will not use Inkfarm again. Our new cartridges are made by HP and work perfectly, even though the inside of our printer is now stained with ink by the Inkfarm leaking cartridges from our first and only Inkfarm transaction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T16:16:41.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

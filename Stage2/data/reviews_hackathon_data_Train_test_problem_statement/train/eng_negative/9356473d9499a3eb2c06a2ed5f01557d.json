The fees are VERY VERY HIGH and then the service you receive is PATHETIC !\nI sold some gift cards and the transaction was fine, it was sent recorded delivery and everything was fine.\nThen I go to try and sell some more unwanted gift cards and PAYPAL put the payment on HOLD ! ...( not release for 21 DAYS ! ).\nI am sorry but that is not acceptable.\nI called them and they were NO HELP AT ALL. The call quality was terrible ! ... I could hardly hear the customer service agent ! - It was like talking to a robot !\nMy problem wasn't resolved and the money was still on hold for 21 DAYS ! ... so I reported it to the buyer and canceled and refunded the sale.\nI WILL NOT PUT UP WITH THIS KIND OF SERVICE!\n.... remember, the longer PAYPAL has your money, the more INTEREST THEY MAKE.\nIt has completely put me off selling with Ebay and I am shutting down my PAYPAL ACCOUNT !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:08:12.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

For the last 3 months I have placed no less than one call each month, giving all my information and my desire to stop all business with this company. My last call as a matter of fact was placed just 2 days ago on Feb. 17, 2017, yet today on Feb. 19, 2017 they made yet another charge to my account. I have also noticed all charges to my account are made on a Sunday when I can't make any phone calls about this matter, or so I thought. Now that we are 4 months into this I have discovered that the number given for customer service is nothing but a dead line where you will talk to a recording without one call email to respond back to my requests. I am 4 months in with no way to shut this down but to report them to my bank as a illegal charge on my card. They will steal your money, once you give them your card number for what you may think is a one time fee, they will take as much money from you as they can making it very hard for you to contact then to tell them to stop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T07:15:27.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

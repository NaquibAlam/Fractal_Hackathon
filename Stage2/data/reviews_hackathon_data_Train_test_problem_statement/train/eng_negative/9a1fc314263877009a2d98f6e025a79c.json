Three were in a pack (which I later realised were not genuine cartridges). The other was a genuine Canon colour cartridge. The genuine cartridge works beautifully, but all the aligning and head cleans in the world cant make the generic Ink Station cartridges work properly in my 2mth old machine!! I was reasonably happy with price, however it was still much more than the cost of my machine. But considering I cant use the stock that I purchased, it wasn't reasonable at all! The packaging was great, and speed of delivery was good. But PLEASE DO NOT BUY generic cartridges from here!! I feel like I have wasted $100 because I now have to go buy more cartridges to replace the three new Ink Station ones that don't work! There's a reason they are CHEAP!! I am appalled at the lack of quality!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:41:55.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

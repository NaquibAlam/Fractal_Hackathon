Although we enjoyed HelloFresh meals, it's been a horrible customer service and support nightmare. Not to mention that I referred your company after getting our first box with only one major delivery issue. We were very satisfied with the meals although it would be great to offer a plan for a family of 6 (we do still exists).\nThe major issues with the company comes from referal offerings of refering friends and family for a Free First boxes of 3 meals for 2 people and HELLOFRESH can't manage the offer and get it delivered to the address of choice to ensure safe delivery. My daughter wanted to try this offer and the company refused to send it to our house to help her out because she lives in an apartment and was worried about trying to get the box due to the office hours don't work for her work schedule so because they wouldn't let her have it delivered to our address so we could get it and take it to her. My daughter had to ask her job to let her get off early to get the box only to find out they still didn't send it to her a second time. Then they said they fixed the issue and she'd be getting her box a few days later only no box and they charged her credit card without any notice for a Free box she never got and then told her it was for the meal coming this week. She said she had never got the first box and they clearly could see that. Horrible experience with the customer service personnel and I hate referring friends and family only to create a nightmare of phone calls and delivery issues and unauthorized charges. I suggest until HELLOFRESH can seriously get a grip on thier CS department and fix all these issues I'd have to say FIND ANOTHER DELIVERY SERVICE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:29:13.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

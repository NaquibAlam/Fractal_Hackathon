In flights from Tehran to Roma, even though I always select the seats at the time of booking, at counter they assign a different seat and of course always exact opposit of what I asks, and they give false justifictions for that, like the plane has changed and so that seat doesn't exist anymore and similar.\nIn a recent flight same story happend, because at the counter they were so rude and patetic, so I asked the flight attendant after I enterd the plane, to let me use the same seat I had selected. I could see online that my seat was still the same I had selected even two hours after I had recieved my boarding pass. The guy nearly eats me!!! I asked very kindly by showing my reservation and seat number.\nAfterall I had to use the assigned seat on boarding pass right on top of the wings ( what I exactly had asked please if you change my seat do not give me one on wings ). After boarding was complete I had to gather my thing and go for a better seat and as always find that my selected seat was there empty and other people in the rows before and after. So I think there was not any kind of problem with that seat but just some people wake up in the morning, go to work and take their problems and empty their anger on poor tired passengers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T10:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T07:50:07.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

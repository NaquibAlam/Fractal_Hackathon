I stopped for a couple of years and just wanted to see a good RBG group for Alliance again.\nI purchased 1 RBG on Saturday around 2:30pm EST. I didn't receive an invite until around 8pm EST on Monday, that is after me having to contact the site. I was excited and ready to actually fight the Horde, however, the Horde never came...Crazy thing is we won an RBG because there was no opposing team....\nThe customer service was great from the site. It was awkward because not a single person spoke in the raid group and no invites were given to speak in Vent, Discord, Skype, or Team Speak. I guess if you are looking for boring wins with no action, then buy runs. In the end I feel like they are not earning my funds, just a way of cheating somehow. I am fine with running my main with pugs and actually enjoy the action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:49:08.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

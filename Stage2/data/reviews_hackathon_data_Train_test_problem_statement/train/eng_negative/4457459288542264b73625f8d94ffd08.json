Two days before we were to travel my father passed away. I attempted to contact Travelocity to cancel his flight, but they said the email address I was giving did not correspond with my account. Strange since I had the itinerary right there in my inbox. I had all the information including the credit card number, booking number, my phone number, our names, address everything, you name it. Just not the email address. I'm assuming there was some sort of technical glitch. But, no matter how high up the chain I tried to go, they simply did not help me. The airline said their hands were tied and they could not help either as the 'ticket' was still in the hands of travelocity.ca. I tried to explain, to get help, I tried everything. They even hung up on me several times. I would NOT recommend Travelocity to ANYONE. There are plenty of other options out there, don't make the same mistake I did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:40:25.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

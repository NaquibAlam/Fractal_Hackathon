Instead I received used loose leaf pages and paid over $140 for it! Even though advertised as hardback they offered to refund but unfortunately needed book for college within a week or so and was afraid the replacement which was hardback and a lot more expensive would not be back on time. I could have easily bought the used loose leaf pages for less than half the price was definitely NOT as advertised. So , if you are ordering hardback, better make sure to have them check their stock before they send you something you don't want. Offering a refund for false advertising is not acceptable, was my first and last purchase from Biblio!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T18:36:27.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Everything was fine for 5 months. I then had to do restore on the phone and when I did it relocked to T-Mobile. I contacted them right away and provided proof it was relocked to T-Mobile. I tried all there suggestions and nothing worked. I even had apple support verify I was locked to T-Mobile.\nThey claimed that because the IMEI was blocked by T-Mobile the unlock wouldn't work?.. the block by T-Mobile was done months before the unlock by unlock river was done. It has nothing to do with a Att sim not working in my phone if it was truly a factory unlock. The IMEI was not black listed only blocked on T-Mobile. So I had the block removed on the IMEI and the of course the phone was still locked and would not work on ATT. Unlock river responded by saying it was still blocked by T-Mobile ( completely false ) I have asked 7-8 to just unlock the phone again per there guarantee. They will not do so. Now they have ignored me hoping I go away and appear to have no intention of living up to there permanent unlock guarantee. They haven't even given my money back.. They do not provide permanent factory unlock as claimed. They provide some kind of half as... unlock hack that is removed with a restore. Do not use them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:58:33.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

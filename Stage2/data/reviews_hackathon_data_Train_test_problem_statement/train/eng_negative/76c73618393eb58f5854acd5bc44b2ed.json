Everything seemed fine and it was clearly stated where the car would be picked up and dropped off and what the price was. After this I received an email from rentalcars.com stating that I would need to pay an additional 200$ for the different location. If that was immediately stated, I wouldn't have chosen their offer. So it's a rip-off, they give a good price upfront and then ask for additional fees later. After stating I was unwilling to pay the additional 200$, booking was cancelled without any explanation or any email.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T11:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:02:35.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

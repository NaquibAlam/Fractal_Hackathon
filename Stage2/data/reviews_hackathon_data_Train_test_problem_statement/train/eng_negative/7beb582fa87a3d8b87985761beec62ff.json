It arrived in good time, however the Waybill I received was not in my name. They tried to blame the shipper, and took over a day to find the Waybill with my name on it. After numerous failed attempts at trying to pay online, I navigated my way through the maze-like phone system to try to speak to a human. I was hung up on twice, and they would direct me to the automated phone payment system which couldn't find my waybill. After calling numerous times, I was understandably very frustrated. The last woman I spoke to was completely unprofessional, would say things like \"did I say I was going to transfer you?\" after I asked her not to put me on the phone payment system since it has failed for me numerous times. After I said \"Pardon?\" she told me something completely different. Worst customer service experience I've had in a very long time. I don't know why this company exists in the first place. I hope to never deal with these people or this company again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:12:59.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

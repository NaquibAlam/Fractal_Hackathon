Then the garage did not send the MOT\nI have just had a real issue\n• The car was serviced on the 22nd December 2016\n• You sent me the MOT but the MOT you sent me was the previous year’s MOT\n• The company you used did not register the MOT and it is not recognised on the government records so this left me liable for the police stopping me as there is no records of me having the MOT (neither me or the person I was trying to sell my vehicle have ever heard of this)\n• The Company who carried out the MOT now insist I have to take the car to their workshop even though it was their mistake\n• I was in the process of selling my car for £12,000 when this was raised causing the offer being retracted, so I have lost the offer through the garages incompetence and I wasted the whole weekend\n• If I hadn’t raised this I would have been driving without any proof of the MOT your appointed company carried out\n• On advice I will be reporting the garage who carried out my MOT to the authorities for failure to follow government mandated process\n• My first contact on this left the phone engaged and did not get back to me and another did not believe I was working away from home next week, I can provide the hotel bookings\nThey were supposed to pick my car up on the Monday they hadn't even arranged for it to be picked up\nThey were supposed to use a competent garage. The reviews for the garage was awful\nSo apart from the initial problems of using Servicing Stop\n• I have no evidence of my current MOT or service\n• I have no MOT logged with the Government\n• I have lost a chance to sell the vehicle at price which was good for me\n• I have wasted time and money from the garages failure\nThis is not acceptable service\nPlease put this right and check the dates on the email you sent to me\nWrong MOT with the wrong date\nNo MOT listed on the government database\nI have had to go to the garage direct as your operator did not come back to me as promised\nApparently the operator who told me that the car would be collected today Monday lied it was never arranged\nThe worst customer service I have ever experienced\nI wait to see how this garage is going to sort the mileage out with the government database now\nI have no option but to take this matter further as no one is contacting me back\nAgain\nYou have cost me time and expense and a lost chance of selling my vehicle\nWorst ever company", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:46:43.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

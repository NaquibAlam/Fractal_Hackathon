I paid via Paypal. 2 weeks later, I had still not received the item. I had sent several messages via the website without any acknowledgement or response so raised a dispute in Paypal. I was told that the item could take up to 3 weeks to be delivered as it was coming from Germany to the UK (incorrect details therefore published on the website). I asked for my order to be cancelled and the amount to be refunded. I agreed to return the item when / if it arrived. The item did eventually arrive and was immediately repackaged and returned recorded delivery the next day. It has now been nearly 1-month since my original contact with this company, and my refund has still not been processed. I have sent another message via the website that I am now waiting on a reply from. If you want quick and efficient service, do not order from this company.

Experienced screen problems with the Armor, screen dimmed and eventually went black and the phone was very hot, it was unusable after only 16 days.\nI contacted Coolicool support on Jan 17 2017, after emails from support with suggestions from their engineer, which did not help, I eventually got an address from Coolicool to return the phone for repair (although their customer service said they would replace or refund me) and returned the phone to Ulefone as they seemed reasonable.\nOnce Ulefone had my phone they emailed and said that they would not replace the phone or refund because it was out of the 15 day replacement/refund warranty period, fair enough, the phone did indeed have the issues from day 16 of my ownership. Repairs were estimated to take 5 weeks.\nNext I receive an email saying they have looked at the phone and the repair will cost $38 because they have determined it is damage not a fault due to manufacture. This is complete rubbish, the phone was never damaged by me in the short time I had it. So I wrote to Coolicool disputing that it was damage, asked them to describe what the damage is and told them I should not be responsible for the repair costs as it is definitely a fault with the phone and it is still under the 12 month warranty for repair. Coolicool have now stopped replying to my emails. Effectively they are holding my phone ransom.\nBig lesson for myself here and I will not purchase from Coolicool, or similarly located companies, again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T19:03:05.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

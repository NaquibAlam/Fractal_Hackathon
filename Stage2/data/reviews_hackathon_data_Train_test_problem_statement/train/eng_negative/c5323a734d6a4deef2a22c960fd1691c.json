They printed my stamp wrong, blamed me, provided no proof that the error was my fault, refused to admit that it might have been theirs, and didn't offer a replacement. The customer service rep was surprisingly condescending, implying that I didn't understand PDF files, which I've worked with for years. Rubber Stamp Champ is fine until something goes wrong, in which case they are incredibly defensive. That shocked me, given how much they advertise their customer service. Now that I realize the truth, I'll buy stamps elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T06:41:17.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

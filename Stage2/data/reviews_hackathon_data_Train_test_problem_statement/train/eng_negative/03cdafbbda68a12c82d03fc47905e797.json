OMG you would have thought i was trying to figure out how to send a rocket to mars. The chat person was completely useless, telling me i had no email entered, yet thats exactly how i got in,,,, with my email. after spending so much time making myself late for someplace else i had to be, I finally managed to remove the item on my own. Had my daughter not wanted two of the items so bad i would have just written it all off, because of her i continued. if my next try is the same i am defineatly going to waste my time, But i will give it one more chance, I'll just be sure to put aside a lot of time and try not to put in the wrong order. Also when I refined it so that i could just find my size, next major waste of time. Why would it take my info then when I go into it to order it doesn't have my size??? why bother refining????. in short not at all a happy customer", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T05:52:21.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

With excitement and anticipation I ordered 3 blinds in January and waited to be overjoyed. They arrived, but one of them, the Essence Cornsilk metal venetian blind 25mm. was sadly the ugly duckling of the trio. The website clearly showed this as a cream coloured blind and it appears when you search for beige/natural. But when it arrived it was Green and the drawstrings were Pink. Not anyone's cup of Tea... I contacted Blinds2go by phone who admitted that it was a bit odd and sent out a sample to compare and asked me to take photos for them to see. The sample did match the blinds - because this was also green.So I contacted Blinds2go again by polite email and mentioned all of the above and attached the photos. The reply I got from Umar was very odd, apparently I was 'annoyed' (never said that) that the blind was 'too \"green\" for your liking' (it's green) and because I \"expressed frustration\" (no I didn't I would just like a blind that isn't multi coloured but cream coloured such as it appears in the webpage). Umar makes no mention of the pink drawstrings nor of the combination of pale green with pink that even Laurence Llewelyn Bowen would shy away from. Finally Umar offers me 'a 25% discount a reorder' (whatever that means??) does that mean I have to order the blind again and will I get pink drawstrings or maybe blue green and purple all at once this time? In conclusion of this sad tale, I wlll be contacting blinds2go again that's if they don't care enough about their reputation to contact me first following this review.\nPS.

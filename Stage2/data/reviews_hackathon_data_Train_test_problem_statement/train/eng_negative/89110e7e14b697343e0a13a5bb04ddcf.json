Most of them turned out fine, but for the New Zealand TM, they registered it under the wrong name and address!! They told me it would get fixed shortly...It's been almost a year, and now when i ask when it's going to get fixed, I don't hear back from them. No reply, no follow up...nothing...Considering I've spent more than $20K in registration costs, this is pretty unacceptable. And to ignore their own customer when it was 100% their fault?! Take your money elsewhere, as there are plenty of other options out there for a cheaper price and will at the least follow up with you when it was their mistake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:27:00.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

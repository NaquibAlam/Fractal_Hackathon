I clipped my horse the day the rug arrived but before she had been turned out. after throwing her old one that was ripped i was left with no choice but to keep the rug because i had nothing warm enough to put her in whilst derby house tested the rug. Crap customer service.\nAfter having a previously bad experience when ordering from derby house i thought id give them a second chance but not a third.. never again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:27:00.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Returning questions with completely irrelevant templates etc. Having worked with providers that keep the money in your own currency before, I never would have thought that 2CO would come up with the ridiculous idea of converting it all to USD against worst exchange rate ever +1.5% international transfer before transferring it back to you in your own currency again with the worst exchange rate +1.5%. So far my average costs for each payment have gone up to 18.9% of the sale (this includes the $20 wiring fee). Now that I want to close the account, they require me to fill out a US tax form. My company is located in Peru and sells only in Peru. I do not want and did not ask to have the US, USD or the US tax office being involved anywhere in the whole process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:22:25.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

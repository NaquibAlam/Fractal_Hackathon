When I arrived at the facility, there were no reservations made. I was then bounced around to two difference facilities trying to find space to move my furniture into storage. The truck Sparefoot reserved for me broke down. The entire day was a disaster.\nWhen I called Sparefoot to assist me with the problems I had, the supervisor \"Kate\" from the Phillapeans told me there was nothing Sparefoot could or would do. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she told me her supervisor was Chuck Gordon, the CEO....??? Really? Well when I asked her to transfer me to him she said that all she could do was give me the generic email for customer service.\nSo Sparefoot took their money and ran. They don't care at all about how the experience turns out for the customer. I will NEVER use Sparefoot again because they simply do not care about resolving problems--only about making reservations so that they get paid. Very poor customer serivce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:19:45.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

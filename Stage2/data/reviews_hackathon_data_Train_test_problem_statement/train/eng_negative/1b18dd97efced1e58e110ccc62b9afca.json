We brought our first one in December 2016 which was OK so we thought as I needed another car to travel to Bristol for work every day we thought yes ok we will go there again... o was we wrong.... when we went to collect the car a warning light popped up we was waiting 2 hours with our four year old son just to find out what was going on yet pick ups surely shouldn't take that long... they wouldn't let us see the car was saying o were just getting it prepped... eventually we got the truth out of them and they booked it in for repair as the glow plugs had gone.... I drove it home after the repair and parked it up .. went to start it the next morning and had the worst screeching noise for under the bonnet... so took it back to them and they had it a further 3 days... said they fix the belt and tensions. But as I went to pick it up that evening as I pulled away from the car parking space the clutch then went I couldn't believe it 3 weeks down the line still not one day use of this car we just brought and now some thing else wrong... bearing in mind they told us all these were done before we brought the car.... so 4 weeks in to it and we had no choice but to try and take this further. Even though we have asked over and over to be contacted by a manager.... we then had to go for another car which we was told would be the same price as the broken on which turned out to be almost 50 pound more a month... 6 weeks down the line we have now got another car but looked in to it on our credit and we have all 3 outstanding still it has now effected us in not only emotional stress but now financial difficulty... we still have no help and every time we try to get closure we get fobbed off or told we get a call back and never do I'm so upset and wish we never came here for our cars....", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:10:08.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

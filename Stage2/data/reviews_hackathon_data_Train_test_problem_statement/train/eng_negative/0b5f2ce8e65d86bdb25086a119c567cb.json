However the quality of what was delivered was more than disappointing. I paid the extra to go large and thank god i did as i would hate to see what the small version would have been. To put it into perspective i got 120 roses into a vase i would normally stick 6 (at a push 12) normal size roses.\nThe photo is a gross oversell of what the product is the reality being each of the rose heads were smaller than a 20p coin.\nAnd to top it all of they were delivered Friday, had drooped heads by Saturday Evening, and were in the bin by Sunday evening.\nI was more disappointed than i have been with interflora (whom i no longer use) who are renowned for using elaborate photos when selling compared to what are actually delivered.\nSadly i cannot recommend this site - the quality of flowers - in short... the local petrol station would have been better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:47:27.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

First problem - we arrived at Vancouver airport from Australia to fly on to Comox on Vancouver Island having prepaid via Travelgenio for two pairs of skis. Air Canada had no record of the payment and we had to pay again. Travelgenio replied that they would not refund the payment as the airline had not confirmed that we had paid for extra baggage. Apparently it was our responsibility to confirm that the service we had paid for through Travelgenio would actually be delivered. Second and most serious problem - our flight out of Comox back to Vancouver on Central Mountain Air was cancelled. We didn't find this out from Travelgenio but from checking ourselves to confirm the flight. Right up to two weeks before we were to fly back to Vancouver, Travelgenio were insisting the flight had not been cancelled despite the fact that we had spoken to Central Mountain Air, something Travelgenio obviously did not do, who confirmed they were definitely not flying out of Comox. Through the efforts of a fantastic Air Canada employee, we managed to get transferred to an Air Canada flight but if we had left it to Travelgenio we would have missed our international connection back to Australia. Hopeless, incompetent and borderline shonky and I have the entire email trail to prove it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:06:21.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

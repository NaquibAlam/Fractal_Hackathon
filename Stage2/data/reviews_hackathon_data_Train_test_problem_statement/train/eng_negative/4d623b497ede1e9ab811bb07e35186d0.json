They make up their own bunches or\npackages, not what you ask for, their courrier doesn't attempt to deliver, and emails left unanswered to an extend they partially answer, and leave main part of your request ignored! Surprise order from Australia to France was not delivered. My sister's family had to go pick it up themselves. It also did not contain what i ordered.\nP.s. their comment below is not really true. I have paid my phone bill to call Spain most of the time myself, and their offering of 10eur refund and \"return customer discount\" are beyond funny. The only satisfaction I got out of it is that due to their poor service they had to get a new bunch of flowers ready when my sister went to pick her gift herself to the neighboring town. Saying that \"everything was dealt with to your satisfaction\" is big exaggeration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:50:02.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

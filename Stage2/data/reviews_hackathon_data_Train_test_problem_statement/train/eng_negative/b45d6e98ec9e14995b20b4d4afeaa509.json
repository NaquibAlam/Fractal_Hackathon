They gave me a fake number. Even sent me a reminder. I showed up at the airport only to be told that I was not a registered passenger and that they did not have any record of me. I contacted Flighthub from the airport and they were useless, hung up on me twice and told me that I was wrong. I'm at the airport. How can I be wrong. Left me with no other way to get home. Had to sleep at the airport and make other arrangements with another airline. Contacted them after and they refused to reimburse me. Told me it was an airline problem, that I needed to deal with to deal with them. Asked to speak to a manager. On hold for 2.5 hours.\nDon't trust them. No customer service and they will not hesitate to take your money and run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T18:25:02.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

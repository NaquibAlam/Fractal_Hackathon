I chatted in and spoke with Keerthiga C who told me I already purchased it which was incorrect, I hadn't. He or she stated it was pending with PayPal, I showed them a screenshot where it wasn't. Keerthiga C stated there was nothing they could do till it failed and they then could cancel it. Again, there was nothing pending. Keerthiga C then tried to pass it off as technical glitch.\nI was never logged into PayPal or hit submit on a purchase so Groupon has now essentially submitted a transaction without me fully authorizing it. I will no longer trust Groupon and am filing complaints with BBB, and IC3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T13:13:21.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

On March 6th I sent an inquiry since the tracking stated the order was \"processing\". On March 7th I received an email stating they had not received the physicians order. On March 9th I contacted the physician and learned they had sent the order on March 1st. I called Healthwarehouse and the agent told me they did have the physician's order but the credit card would not go through. He said they use that same email for all concerns hoping the customer will call in. He said they had tried to call me several times (I had NOT received any calls from them). While on the phone with him he cancelled the first order and ran it through again with the same credit card and it went through fine. Now I'm on day 10 and the order is still processing.

It was not and is basically a load of Chinese rubbish. The instructions are misleading the structure is flimsy at best and totally inadequate for what its purpose is - it will blow over with a bit of wind. The pieces do not fit it is badly designed and constructed, the instructions are useless and the fixings totally inadequate. I will need to weld angle iron to the frame to have any hope it will stand up outside. Trade Tested are basically a bad company to deal with. Firstly, from the start i had problems dealing with them - a piece was missing and it took multiple phone calls, emails and an enormous amount of my time waiting to get through to 'customer service' to try to resolve the matter and get them to send through the vital missing piece to only find the warranty had expired and because I had opened the box I couldn't send the unit back to get a refund. BEWARE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE selling inferior products and there will be no recourse to get your money back. A bitter lesson learned. Basically a load of rubbish that will have to go to the dump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:31:12.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

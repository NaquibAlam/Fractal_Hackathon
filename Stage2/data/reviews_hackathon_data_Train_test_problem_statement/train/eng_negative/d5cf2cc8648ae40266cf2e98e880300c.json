I called days prior to ensure the deliverance of the bouquets. I received an email stating the day of the order had been cancelled by the sender. When I inquired the representative stated it was a mistake. But later in the day I received a call stating the item wouldn't be delivered as they ran out of teddy bears the day prior. This was a big lack of communication, honesty, and organization on Cookie Bouquet. I ordered two bouquets that day to be delivered to two different individuals. Only one of the orders where delivered. Due to the company's lack of communication, and capability to fulfill the order they suggested to deliver the cookie bouquet on the 16th. I refused as it defeated the purpose of Valentine's Day. And was fortunate enough to be refunded. Will never order again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:50:58.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

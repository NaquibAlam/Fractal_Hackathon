They obviously didn't think that anyone would count how many were delivered - but as I was using them for a school charity event, i counted - they had short changed me by 50 roses. They would usually get away with this - how many of us know what flowers we should receive when they are delivered to us??\nI was then offered a nominal refund - 25 pounds in all - which i refused! I asked for the flowers to be returned, as their website states that if you are not happy you can have a refund.\nThey have now sent me a further 50 roses - which have arrived damaged, several have the heads broken off, and the rest are brown around the edges - certainly well past their sell by date.\nBoth days i have been on hold to customer services for well over an hour.\nWhen i rang giving my order number - they even couldn't find the order!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:44:08.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

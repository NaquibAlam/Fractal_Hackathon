They promoted low prices and hide luggage costs. I went through the booking process and only after I paid I realised the luggage was not included. Why? Because they call it extra luggage and it is hidden in between other additional services. When I emailed them to figure out what is going on, they sent me to the airline company of course. When I asked for a refund, they also sent me to the airline company. This is absolutely the worst website where you could purchase a ticket. I strongly advise all of you to avoid them!!!\nTo add...yes, you call it EXTRA luggage! You would call it extra luggage when you already had the first luggage included. What kind of miss-leading information is that? Obviously you are trying to fool people with low prices", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:18:47.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

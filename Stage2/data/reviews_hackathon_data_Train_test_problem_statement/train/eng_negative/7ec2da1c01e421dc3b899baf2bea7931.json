They sent me my lockbox, I set up my first dog walk for my 2 year old lab. when I got the notification that my dogs walk was over I came home to find a walker and my dog both stuck outside of my house because the lock box that they had given to me was broken and she couldn't get my house key out of it, I soon sent her home and told her that my husband would be home soon so not to worry about it I contacted Wag I was hung up on twice they didn't seem to really give a crap that I was locked outside of my house with my eight-month-old and it was getting cold out. My husband didn't end up coming home for another 45 minutes and during that time I had called Wag a few more times trying to speak with someone higher than the people they were giving me two nobody seems to care they literally told me to let them know how it goes. My husband ended up getting home and breaking the lock so that we could get inside of our house they never called me to check up and see how things were going I had my second wags walk scheduled and I had to be home to let the dog walker inside of my house because nobody cared to send me a new lock box either. This company is poorly thrown together. You don't even get to speak with the dog walker before they come inside of your home and walk your dog there's no way to coordinate with the dog walker either won't be recommending this company to anyone anytime soon", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:06:47.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

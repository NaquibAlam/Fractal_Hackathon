I talked with Eric at the company and he and I tried to get it to work while he read the directions and I followed them. It was exactly what my husband and I had been doing and it still would not work. We returned it and now we are told it works for them. It was never used and sent back exactly as we got it. They will not credit us OR send another product. I have NEVER had such poor customer service and will NEVER order from this company again and will advise others not to use them either. The very worst experience I've had shopping and I do almost ALL of my shopping online.\nResponse to VaporNation:\nThe vapor nation response is not true. I was not told the product was restocked. I did get a call asking for a call back, but I had been so upset over this that I didn't want to discuss it again. I ordered from another company and got two products that worked immediately with NO drama!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:08:05.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

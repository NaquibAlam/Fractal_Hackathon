I have tried being a loyal customer, became a gold card member through loyalty to the brand. I have had my card stolen a couple times, and getting it sent to me has been a long and difficult process. In the mean time, I lose rewards and cannot collect points, so I keep losing what I am trying to hard to earn. Why do points expire? So many of my reqards have been lost that way. I am at the point of giving up, and going to a local place with a simple punch card. I have lost my birthday rewards for not using it fast enough too. They should not be ezpiring like that. Also, many times, I am highly disappointed by the quality of my drink. People burn it or make it taste weird and many times I wait a long time for my drink and have terrible customer service. Between all of it, I just think I am going to finally stop going there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:29:53.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

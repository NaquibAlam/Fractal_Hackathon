When I called the customer service line, I followed the instructions on the automated menu, which clearly states \"if this is not an emergency, and you would like to remain on hold to speak to a customer service representative, press 1\". I did so, and waited for over twenty minutes, and the person who picked up asked \"what's your emergency\", then argued with me about this being an emergency line and my lost phone was not an emergency, but why would I wait for 20 minutes if this was an emergency?\nAfterwards, the rep. Refused to call the driver and asked me to use the lyft app to file a lost and found claim. How am I supposed to do that without my phone? That's loterally why I'm calling them, and I am using someone else's phone! The rep refused to let me talk to their supervisor, and refused to connect me to another human being who would help me and said \"we do these claims by email only\". The wouldn't look me up by name either.\nWORST SERVICE EVER!!!\nI feel bad for the drivers, because they are actually decent people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:12:44.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

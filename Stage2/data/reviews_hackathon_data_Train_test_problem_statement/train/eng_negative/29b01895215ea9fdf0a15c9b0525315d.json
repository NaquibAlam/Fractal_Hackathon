There was no driver. The hot line number for Flitways did not respond. After having waited an hour we took a yellow cab instead. Wrote to the help desk from the Hotel.

An answering machine responded \"the mailbox is full\" ???\nI have no trust to this company\nNeedless to say I had prepaid everything.\nI clearly Recommend NOT to use this company.\nUpdated - I have now got a full refund of my money.

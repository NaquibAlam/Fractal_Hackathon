Finally after 5 months of phone calls and chasing up a company i spent over Â£1000 on taps with, the correct taps turned up and the plumber fitted them, only to find that the taps were faulty and you couldn't turn off either the hot or the cold water. After the previous lack of customer service, and the fact i had already messed my plumber around over the last 5 months with set dates of delivery, he offered to replace the faulty parts locally sourced for a set price. When speaking to Park Bathrooms about this they refused to do anything about the matter, since in their words, \"you have already fixed this yourself so there is no problem\", which absolutely shocked me. Terrible service and quality of taps and I would never use them again and would advise anyone thinking of ordering through this company to avoid doing so at all costs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T14:50:04.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

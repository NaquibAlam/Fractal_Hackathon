On a flight from Malaga to Bucharest via Munich, the food served in Business class was a disgrace. Three olives and some tired salad leaves, half an egg and some pumpkin seeds. When I think of the nearly 700 euros that the ticket cost, I wonder what kind of service they include to justify such a shameless meal service. And yet nobody ever solves this issue which occurs on more and more of their flights. It seems like they are making cost saving, but on whose expense? The tickets keep getting more expensive, while the service can now compete neck to neck with low cost airlines, which you can fly at a fraction of the cost. It's plain simple, unless there is no other travel alternative, I will stop flying this airline and when I have to fly with them, I will make sure I bring food from home with me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T08:56:42.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

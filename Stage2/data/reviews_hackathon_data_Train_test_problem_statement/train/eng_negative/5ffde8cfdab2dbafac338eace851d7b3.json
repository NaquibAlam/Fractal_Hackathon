DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY. I am still trying to obtain a refund I am lawfully due after 4 weeks.\nFirstly they did not explain that I would have to pay customs charges to accept delivery, this was £12.37 on top of my purchase price. Unacceptable.\nSecondly the item then arrived and it is faulty. I purchased a pair of size 10 trainers and the insoles are a size 7 or 8 at the most so cannot be worn, the trainers themselves also look nothing like the photograph!\nAfter many messages backwards and forwards the company admitted they are the wrong item and offered either £6.00 to keep (I have now paid in total £40.00) a replacement or a refund - as long as I return the trainers! I expect a full refund but why would I have to incur more expense to return a faulty item.\nI will be taking this to the financial ombudsman as they are holding me to ransom for a refund I am due.\nAVOID!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T22:12:27.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

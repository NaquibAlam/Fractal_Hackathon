Bravofly offers refund or rebooking to different day (we are only going 2 days and hotel is booked too and cant be changed). We all choose refund but unlikely some of the other travel agents, Bravofly charges a handling fee of 20euro to refund the money, a cancel I did not ask for or at least I had no other alternative as they didnt even offer to book a seat on a different airline. Most other friends is directed to the airnine itself for refund by their travel agent but Bravofly didnt offer that and only far into the refund correspondance its to be known that they dont offer the full refund (yes I have read terms and Cond. but you cant charge a fee for something I didnt ask to cancel.... Its like I go into the supermarket and buy milk, the milk costs 10dkr, I get to the registry and pay 10dkr but before I leave the store they stop me and say \"hey btw, that milk is not for sale after all but we take 2dkr to take it back so you only get 8dkr for not buying your milk\". In WHAT country and which LAW allows you to do that?? And I dont give a flying F about what you write in T&C, you can write anything you want but the law says otherwise !\nStory is not over yet, I then ask for refund, they tell me I can get it minus the fee, I say no I dont accept that, I wish to cancel refund and talk directly to the airline, I get an OK back. Then the following days I get 2 seperate emails stating that my refund is accepted and money on the way back to my account. I write back again and say I wish to cancel, but this time it says we cant....T&C bla bla bla.\nThis is no longer a money issue, its a matter of principle and I will take it all the way to get it back if I have to.\nAirline I talked to send back money a week ago, yet bravofly claims it takes time to get back, now after a week I got it back, still missing my 20 euro....\nDid I mention NEVER TO USE BRAVOFLY?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T22:50:09.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

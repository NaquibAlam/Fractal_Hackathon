DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM AT ALL COSTS!! After my in-laws missed their return flight from Delhi to Montreal, we booked last-minute flights this morning through TravelGenio on Air India and Air Canada. We received a confirmation email immediately, but no follow-up email with the actual tickets. It was only after calling Air India four hours later that we learned that the reservation had been cancelled because of payment issues. We never received any cancellation notice from TravelGenio. We then called TravelGenio and they told us that \"the seats on that flight [were] no longer available\" and there was nothing they could do except look for new flights for the next few days or reimburse us. This company led us to believe that everything was fine, when my in-laws in fact had no seats on the flight. Looking at other comments, this is not a unique instance. If you want to have your tickets cancelled without your knowledge, this is a great company for you. Otherwise, DO NOT use this awful company!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:19:11.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

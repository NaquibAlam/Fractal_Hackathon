I had to change a few things then I found out that the ferry they needed to take to get to the airport decided they were not doing a return run. So I called and explained all this. I tried to get them on another flight but it took ALL DAY to try and get this company to return my calls. When I would speak to someone they said they had to call me back which took hours. Now I am trying to cancel the flights which means my kids don't get to say goodbye to their grandfather and they will not refund the money, they will take $500 for a fee, but said we would get West Jet credit. Only problem is my mom paid for these tickets and they will only give credit to the ticket holders which are my children! Now my mom is almost 82, just lost her husband of 62 yrs and now she has lost $3,000.00 because of this company. NO COMPPASSION FROM THESE GUYS. And I have been dealing with this ALL FREAKIN DAY. My dad died and this is how I have to spend my day? WOW not good customers service at all!@!@", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:42:27.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

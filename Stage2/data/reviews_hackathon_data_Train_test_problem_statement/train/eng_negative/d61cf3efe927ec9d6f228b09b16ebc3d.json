WOW\nthey only answer via email, asking to deposit more money and with these words \"we have contacted warehouse staff to ship it out as soon as possible\"\none week and 2 weeks are not common for repackaging and shipping item because when i used their service to ship to my USA customer, it only took 1-2 days.\ni am verified user, i used their site for more than 10 shipments,, all shipped succesfully within 1-2 days\nand now they treat me, their customer like this for large/expensive shipments. BE CAREFUL IF THEY ASKED FOR MORE MONEY LIKE MY CASE ABOVE. (1-2 weeks no update then suddenly ask money because they said my package showing iraq as address, when it should be deliver to indonesia, system fault? what? )\nI WILL UPDATE THIS POST IF THEY ARE REALLY SHOWING GOOD FAITH INSTEAD THEY AUTOMATIC TEXT like this \"we have contacted warehouse staff to ship it out as soon as possible\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:03:55.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

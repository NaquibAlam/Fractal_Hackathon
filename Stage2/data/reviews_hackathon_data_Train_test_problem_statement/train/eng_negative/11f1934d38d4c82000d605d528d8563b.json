'16 returned the car: no incident, no damages, I took pictures. Car inspected by the Company's girl who did not find anything\nEnd Nov.'16, Flizzr issued a claim for scratched and reimbursement of 950â‚¬ as the insurance excess... more than 45 days later (some days before I had removed the video)\nI objected that my wife, myself and Flizzr's girl did not see the scratches!. Flizzr responded that it was found after a more detailed check.\nBesides, I don't understand why the claim was not issued immediately after the return ... No answer/justification on it from the Company!\nFor the above reasons I am skeptical about the Flizzr's behaviour and find unfit its Customer relationship", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:55:43.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

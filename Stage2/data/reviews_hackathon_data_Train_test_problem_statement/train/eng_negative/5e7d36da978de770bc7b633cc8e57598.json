They may well be the cheapest in Tenerife however rest assured that you get what you pay for -,in this case you pay a little but get nothing.\nThey use euro to pound conversion rates that never exist to con you into booking and then when your bank statements arrive sure enough you get nothing like the Quote: d exchange rate.\nThey also hide within the terms and conditions in small print the fact that you will have to pay a mandatory refuelling charge of anything between 25 and â‚¬35 which is non-refundable in addition to the rate you pay on booking. Beware the hidden extras!\nThe customer service if you have a problem is non-existent there is no telephone contact only emails and they do not answer them.\nFoolishly I booked on a number of occasions with them always believing the next time would be a better experience , however it was always far worse. Never again. Pay a little extra - do not use this shockingly bad company. You will be disappointed!\nThey Quote: rates which are designed to attract bookings when you arrive at the airport you will find out the real cost! And then when you try to contact them you get no reply , no help and no service , they have had your money and do not want to know. You have been warned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:51:55.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

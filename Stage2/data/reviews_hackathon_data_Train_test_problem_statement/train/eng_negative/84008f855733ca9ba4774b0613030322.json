Website said if done by 20th will receive by 24th. My trampoline did not arrive for another two weeks. Received trampoline and there were no springs in package or pole padding. Took until February to have springs with pole pading sent out to me. I was only credited $40 refund I paid over $500 for these products that are more expensive but I got on sale. I receive the springs and pole pading. The springs are the incorrect size. New correct springs were sent out to me following week with pole pading. Upon assembling basketball hoop discovered back metal frame was left out of package. Now 18 Feb and waiting for this. Staff are very poor at communicating with you and I'm disgusted with the lack of care and customer service I will never be using this company ever again and I highly don't recommend them. A real shame as the product good quality. Bunch of monkeys to say the very least.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:16:41.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

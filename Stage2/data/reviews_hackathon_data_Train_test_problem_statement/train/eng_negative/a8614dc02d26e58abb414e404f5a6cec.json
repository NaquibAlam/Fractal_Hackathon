I informed them one month in advance and received a reply that the reimbursment would take place within 21 days. I received this email early December, coming back from my trip at the beginning of January I checked my account and no refund was executed. I have sent several reminders in which I politely asked for information on the refund and its status. I received a standard answer that the payment had not yet been executed, without providing a date for the refund or any further explanations for the delay.\nThe reimbursment conditions stated on the website and in their reply were not respected (free cancellation with refund in 21 working days). It is now more than one month after the deadline of reimbursement and still counting. I start to think that late refunding is a strategy that this company use to yield interest. That is probably why they keep on this delaying my reimbursment (of an important amount).\nI hope that at some point I will get the refund but I am honestly start to doubt it. To avoid finding yourself in the same extremely unpleasant and unprofessional situation I would strongly advise to avoid dealing with GalaHotels. Do not hesitate to share this information.\nDispite the fact that the company replied to my comment here below no one contacted me, the refund did not take place, nothing has happened in these 3 days. Galahotels I am just asking to have back my money. This is absurd that it takes so much time, that you continue providing standard answers, no update on the refund and no concrete action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T17:35:39.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

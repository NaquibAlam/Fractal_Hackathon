Website is annoying to use when making your invite, it shut off and had me redu the order like 3 times. Then when i went to checkout i saw they put 3 orders of my invitations and im glad i really looked at it because i had to remove it. They dont give you an actual font size. Its all a guess. They say if your unhappy you can get money back but not with personalization. Just a warning. EVERYTHING is personalized so dont fall for that scam. You have to pay 50% of the order if you want to fix anything. And if its something that you feel is on their end its a joke to get any help. The Customer Service is HORRIBLE I cant express that enough. If you are someone like me that needs good customer service to help make something a little better to move forward without stress then this is not the place. Its worth the extra money to have no stress and i regret going with this company. If there's anything you need help with it wont happen. I spoke with someone that was apparently the supervisor and she treated me horrible on the phone. They dont care about you as a client and possible referrals to others.. just your money. She lied to me and told me that she didnt have a manager, there's nothing she could do for me, she had no empathy in her to voice that i was upset or stressed out. Got a call from the manager so that proved the supervisor lied to me and was suppose to receive a call back from the manager after that and never did. There's more to the story but without making it super long, I made a decision to not give them anymore of my money and will tell everyone to avoid the stress. This is the only issue i have had with my wedding plans. I only give them 1 star because i liked the overall look of the invites, but they were not exactly how i expected and wanted and the customer service is a complete joke.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:11:22.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

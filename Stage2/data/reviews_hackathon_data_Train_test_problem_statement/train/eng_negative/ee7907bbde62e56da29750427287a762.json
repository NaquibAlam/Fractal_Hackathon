The previous travel service was very good and I was very impressed at the service and speed. That's where this stopped. Our flight was delayed by 5 hours (not their fault) and the instructions for the transfers were not accurate. After wasting 45 minutes at the airport trying to sort our prepaid transfers we were told it hadn't been booked. We gave up and got the bus in to the city, thinking as we booked it as a package it won't be a problem getting the money back for a service they didn't provide. It clearly said on the paperwork we are to call to book the return transfer as no booking made. So didn't bother.\nGot back and contacted lastminute.com for a refund - the service (if you can call it that) was horrific. It took 8 emails at least, me contacting the transfer supplier directly and to threaten legal advice to get the refund.\nI am absolutely appalled at the service. If it's a flight only or hotel you may be ok, but I certainly won't be booking any of their services again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:05:51.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

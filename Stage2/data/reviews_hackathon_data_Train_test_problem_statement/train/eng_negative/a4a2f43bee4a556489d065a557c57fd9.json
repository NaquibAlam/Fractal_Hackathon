I had to change my flight and it was a nightmare. The fees were expensive, which I understand ($175 total on a $227 flight). But simply to cancel and rebook a flight for the next day, it took over an hour and a half on the phone. In my mind this is completely unacceptable and a waste of time. The first agent hung up on me accidentally and then never called back. The second put me on hold for \"3-5 minutes\" and then came back on the line more than 20 minutes later. And the fact that I even had to call to do this is archaic, since it could easily be done online.

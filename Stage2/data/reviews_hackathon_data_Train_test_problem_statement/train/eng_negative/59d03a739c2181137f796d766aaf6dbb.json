Back in September we had a customer who ordered cards. They were, however, incorrectly printed, which was not the fault of Plastek, but we were okay'd to have them sent back and reprinted. The problem we have is that we still do not have the replacement cards months later, despite being approved by our main contact there to have them reprinted. Here I am passing this information on to my customer, telling them when they are expected to come in, and then when they don't come I'm the one who the customer chews out. We switched to a new card provider because of service like this, and maybe that's why we're having so many problems getting these cards reprinted. Either way, the service we've had with Plastek has been, and continues to be, terrible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T20:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:16:04.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

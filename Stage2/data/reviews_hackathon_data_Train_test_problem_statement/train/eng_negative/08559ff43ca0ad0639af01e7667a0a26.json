I would not need to email and call them so often had my order, which I placed in November, arrived when it should have. We were told it would arrive the first week of February. No such luck. Then we were told it was because of the Chinese New Year that the order was delayed and it would be several more weeks. The Chinese new year is not a surprise. It is on the calendar every year and should be accounted for. After several more weeks passed I called again to check on the order and was told it has still not even shipped out of China yet. Now we are looking at possibly the second week in April. I would've ordered from somewhere else long ago if they had kept me updated on what was happening and I didn't have to keep investigating on my own.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T10:57:38.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

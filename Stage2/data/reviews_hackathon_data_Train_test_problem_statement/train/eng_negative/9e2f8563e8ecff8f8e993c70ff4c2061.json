A few weeks ago I wanted to buy the PAX 3, I first tried on the main page, at Pax Labs, I had problems with the payment and decided to try on this, Vape World. I tried the first time, I was sent a message of the number of the order and 3 days later, they send me a message saying that the payment was fraudulent and that I had to enter a new card to be able to make the purchase. I went to my bank to solve the problem, it turned out that my card did not have any problem. I tried to buy the PAX again, they sent me the confirmation message of the purchase, but my card had not charged anything. Then I understood that nothing was right. I tried again a third time, with a new card and I have the same problem. I contacted the customer service\nwishing to know how the package was going, in case the purchase had been given, they answered me but they did not solve anything, they left my case unfinished. Maybe somebody will help me around here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:00:31.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

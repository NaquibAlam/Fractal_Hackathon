If the price offered is incorrect why isn't it changed? I searched again and found an acceptable alternative and tried to select seats. But all that was offered was the choice of a eat next to my wife or any available seat. The cost of this \"seat selection\" showed up in the charges column even though I had no idea what the seats would be. This is not seat selection it is a total rip-off. A very poor experience with FlightHub.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:06:44.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

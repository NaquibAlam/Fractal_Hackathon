My wife ordered some product for her sister in Georgia. We live in Virginia.\nWe never received a confirmation nor was the soup(three types were ordered)delivered by christmas. She made repeated attempts to call them and email them as well. No emails or calls were retuned by the company. We finally got so mad she contacted pay pal to get our money returned. After doing this, we received a ship notice from the soup company stating the soup had been shipped...finally.\nIt was revived finally 2 months late. Also, the quality of the product was inferior and we told the recipients to throw the rest away.\nI would NOT recommend this company to any one. Very unpleasant experience all the way around!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T23:09:20.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

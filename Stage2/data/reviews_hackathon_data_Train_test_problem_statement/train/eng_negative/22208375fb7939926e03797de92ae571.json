Very unstable battery, turns itself off 10-15 times a day (not even exaggerating.), AUX port doesn't work properly,...\nI was offered a refund by Banggood, but I have to send the phone back. I could agree with that, however, to send lithium-ion batteries out of NZ, you HAVE to send courrier (80$+).\nBanggood responded the post office had to drop the price as they only refunded up to 40$ shipping costs.\nI responded to that email saying that usually companies arrange pick-ups of faulty goods and as they don't accept the price I was given by the postal services, I was expecting them to arrange a pick-up instead in this situation.\nSince then I did not get any replies.\nThe phone was ordered on Pre-order, according to preorder, the phone would be delivered before Christmas, ended up arriving end of January. I sent a e-mail weekly asking for updates (As Banggood was dead-silent), and i was told on a few occasions to 'Just have some patience'.\nOveral quality of their goods is low, certain things are definitely worth the price but more often than not, items are un-usable as the quality is just too low.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T12:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:14:30.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Consider this an inadequate experience, but no friction since no interaction with Dresslilly staff. I ordered 2 blouses that were labeled 3XL. They were from the Plus Size section of the website. They are clearly not the usual 3X that comes from most brick and mortar stores. Dresslilly should label them correctly. I can wear them but the person they were intended for as a gift will not be able to wear them!!! Won't bother to send back or ask for a replacement. Will steer clear of any deals on this website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:27:02.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

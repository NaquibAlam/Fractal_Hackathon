Lyft has the ability to increase rates to make the service a service not a giveaway. I've heard too many stories of drivers being deactivated simply based off of a passenger's feedback, never asking the driver their side of the story. I've also heard stories of drivers not being completely covered in certain situations, specifically when a passenger is involved. The city of Seattle requires Lyft to provide uninsured motorist insurance for the driver, but the terms of the insurance (not) clearly state the coverage only applies IF the driver is in driver mode. Sorry drivers, no uninsured motorist coverage unless the driver has it on their personal insurance.\nLyftLine... a joke... travel 15 minutes to pick up someone to take home under $3. Again, great for passenger, horrible for the drivers. (Outside of The City of Seattle)\nPrimeTime: you could get a request from a PrimeTime area that was 150%. You take the ride with no knowledge if the ride is PrimeTime or not. At end of ride, 0% extra. The competition tells you up front of ride has an increase attached to it.\nCustomer Service: Slow is the nicest way to put it. I often take to twitter to get a faster response to incidents. Incidents are supposed to be resolved in 24 hours. I had one take over 48. When you do get a response. They are frequently copy and pasted responses in which the agent doesn't take the time to change the name in the email to yours. Makes you feel the Lyft Love.\nLocal Office: Excellent service, little parking. You'd think that for a company that relies on drivers and their personal cars, parking would be available or even reimbursed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:08:52.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

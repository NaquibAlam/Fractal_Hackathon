What I ordered: a phone case and glass screen protector for an iPhone 7 plus. What I got: a phone case and glass screen protector for a regular iPhone 7. No big deal, it happens. But for the past three months (it is now March 3rd) I've been trying to exchange for a new size and still have not received what I originally ordered.\nFirst of all, there is no customer service phone number on their website, so I had to send an email about my request for an exchange. I received general instructions about how to return my unwanted case, so I sent it off with detailed information about the actual sizes I needed and where to send them. After tracking the package I found that the items had been successfully returned back to their facilities, but for two weeks after that date never heard anything about the status of my exchange. I never got an email saying the old items had been received, and I never got an email about when my new case was set to arrive.\nAfter sending many emails with no reply, I finally resorted to direct messaging the company on twitter. I got a quick response and was told on February 21st that my old items had, indeed, arrived but had never been processed? I was assured that my exchange was accepted that day and that I would be given a tracking number as soon as my new items shipped in the next 1-2 days. Well, 6 days later I still hadn't received a tracking number so I messaged the same person on twitter where I was told my items didn't ship out until that morning (the 27th). She gave me a tracking number and told me I could expect my items to be delivered in 2-3 business days.\nFast forward 4 days, I just tracked my package and come to find that even though I was told it shipped out on February 27th, it didn't actually ship until March 1st. Although I should have received my products days ago, they are still is Los Angeles, California. I'm so incredibly frustrated and wouldn't recommend ordering from this site, solely for the fact that their customer service can't get their crap together and if, by chance, you are sent the wrong item, you won't receive your actual order for another 3.5 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:26:21.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

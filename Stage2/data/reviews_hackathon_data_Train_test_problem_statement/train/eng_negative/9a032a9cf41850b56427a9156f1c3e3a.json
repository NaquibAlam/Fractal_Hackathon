I entered all my books on the site which gave me a total of 25$ back. I understand everything may not be accepted, but they e-mailed me saying i will be getting 6$ back because some of my books were not acceptable because they were in poor condition, which was FALSE because I inspected each and every book and they were PERFECT. I sent one book in a binder because it came loose leaf, they kept my binder and sent me back the papers in a rubber band. The receipt they sent was noted for an Art & Painting book which all I sent was History, Philosophy & Keyboarding. So the book listed was not even mine. I emailed them twice with my experience and no one emailed me back, so terrible customer service. TRUST ME PEOPLE, DONT DO THIS. JUST DONATE YOUR BOOKS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:49:33.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

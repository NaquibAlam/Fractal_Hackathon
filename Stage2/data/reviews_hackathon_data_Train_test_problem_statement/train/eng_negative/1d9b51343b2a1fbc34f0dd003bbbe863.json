This request was written in the confirmation email I received, so I thought everything was okay to proceed. I was then emailed to download an app to printout my order, however I had no internet access at this time as I was in Antarctica for the 2weeks preceding the pickup of the hire car and by the time i did get access to the internet and therefore the email to download the app, the download did not work. I arrived at my destination to find the Avis employee with a car that COULD NOT cross the boarder from Argentina to Chile. This was a very stressful situation as I had accommodation paid for in Chile and the idea of a great holiday with no way to get there. There were no buses running or any other form of transport (the reason I hired a car!) Fortunately, I eventually got the Avis employee to take me into town where we finally found another rental company with a car that could cross the boarder. 5 hours later, $300 extra and lots of stress I managed to get a rental car.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:15:05.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

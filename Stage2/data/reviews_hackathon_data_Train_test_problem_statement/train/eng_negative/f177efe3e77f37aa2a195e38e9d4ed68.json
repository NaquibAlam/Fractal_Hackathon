I was then told that the booking had been traced and the unnamed source acting on my behalf via Amoma had admitted liability and would confirm the booking.\nI complained to the hotel management and was told that an investigation had been put in place - over a week later I have heard nothing more.\nAmoma's website does not acknowledge the words complain, complaint or how to complain\nAdvice\nNever use Amoma\nBe careful about the companies that offer deals on Trivago etc\nIf you are sent a reservation to print off, make sure it has details of the organisation offering it and if it doesn't print off the email as well to identify the source\nCheck the price on the direct booking website of the hotel and Quote: the deal you have found and ask them to match it - or confirm the booking with the hotel when you receive the voucher\nDONT WHATEVER YOU DO, USE AMOMA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:28:31.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

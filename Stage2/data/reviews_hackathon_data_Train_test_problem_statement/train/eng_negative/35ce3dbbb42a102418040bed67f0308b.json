Only one of the rental places had a long queue, inevitably ours - Goldcar. Stood for 20 minutes before moving as there was a lady arguing at the front about insurance. I thought 'it's fine, I've paid for full coverage, I'm insured'. After an hour, got to the front of the queue, lady tells me I am not insured [note: this was an outright lie, I was insured] and that I must pay 135 eur extra for full coverage. I refused, she got quite irate by this, but proceeded nonetheless to take the deposit of 1400 euros off my credit card. She then asked me for a debit card to pay 105 euros. I asked why, since my booking told me I had nothing more to pay. 'Fuel and taxes'. [Right, so how does that work out at 95cents a litre?] I refused, but she pointed out that I couldn't take the car unless I paid it. She also rudely pointed at the queue behind me saying I was wasting everyone's time. Reluctantly I paid the 105 euros as like everyone else, I wanted to get on with my holiday [I later realised the queues are purposeful and they try and make you feel bad for staying and arguing].\nAnyway, we get to the car and the aerial was missing and there were a few scratches on the car that weren't marked on the sheet, but there was no one around and rather than go back and queue for another 2 hours it was so late that we just took photos and left, emailing them to myself for a date stamp.\nChapter 2\nHalfway through the holiday I though I heard a faint sound, so we pulled over and sure enough there was a nail & washer in the car tyre. However, this nail looked so worn in (I took photos), that it looked like it had been there for a long time, although I obviously had no evidence. The tyre was still inflated and I could have carried on driving. However, I wasn't comfortable with this, so called Goldcar head office. I asked them what they wanted me to do, and they were as much use as a chocolate teapot. I told them 'look, I'm going to change over to the space saver and drive in and get another car.' The woman on the phone 'oh okay, I'll let them know to expect you'. 2 hours later I turned up at the airport on the space saver. The guy there told me I'd have to discuss it at the front desk [heart sinking]. Another queue whilst I watch people get shafted for fuel and insurance [including a girl in front of me crying because she didn't have enough money]. There was also a chap behind me who was on his stag do and missed the first three hours because his car was scratched and there wasn't any recording of the damage. Whilst in the queue, I watched one lady behind the desk serve customers and two others move bits of paper around whilst there was a huge queue. Absolutely disgraceful - and I wasn't sure this was whether they were again driving the queue up or simply couldn't face any customers. Prepared for what was to come, I got to the front and was told I'd have to pay 200 euros for the tyre - I showed the lady on the desk the photo and explained that if I'd wanted to I could have driving on the tyre with a nail in it and returned it 2 days later and no one would have known. She said it must have been me since they always check the cars between customers [ as above, this is clearly not the case]. She again told me there was a queue behind me and I pointed out politely that this was because she was causing the problems, not resolving them. I had to bite the bullet and pay 200 euros for the tyre [she briefly tried to sell me the 'super relax' cover again on the new car, before I told her where to go. Needless to say, the new car we were given again had scratches and a missing aerial that were not marked on the sheet. Again we took photos and emailed them to ourselves.\nChapter 3\nReturning the car to the airport I was full of dread, worried what pain Goldcar would inflict on the last of my holiday. To my surprise, they didn't even check the car, the guy chucked the keys in with a bundle of others and we just walked off. This was the most painless part of the process but I realised it's just because Goldcar are a shambles organisation and don't actually do any of there due diligence that sometimes would work against them - I realised in hindsight I could have taken a key and scratched the side of the car and they could probably never have proved it was me due to their complete ineptitude.\nFortunately I had a great holiday, but this was a real downer on a weeks holiday spending so much time at the airport. I witnessed so many peoples holidays get off to a bad start that I swore to myself I would follow it up - which is what I'm doing now. Do yourselves a favour, go nowhere near Goldcar. I realise now that Goldcar rely on undercutting people on comparison websites, then fleecing you at the desk, which actually makes it significantly more expensive. My suspicion is that they are aware this is a non sustainable business model and they realise that their reputation will eventually catch up with them. My worry is that the owners get away with it and make a tidy profit doing so. How many holidays ruined before this point I don't know. I'd love the owners to have stood in that queue for 2 hours and witnessed what I did.\nAnyway, that's it, unfortunately there is no happy ending other than to learn from it and try and make others aware so they don't make the same mistake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T16:42:03.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

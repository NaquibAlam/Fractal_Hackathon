My glasses won't stay on. First I contacted when a screw fell out to try to get a new one sent. I was told they would look into it and let me know. The next day I got an email with a RMA without explaination. I can't return the glasses because they are my only pair.\nEventually after contacting a couple more time, some new screws were sent. Wrong screws though!\nI called again to try to get the right screw sent. I was told a week ago that the employee I talked to me would try and get back to me by the next day. I left her a message yesterday and have not heard back.\nTerrible experience.

Finally took it out and threw it in the trash. Then found out I was on the auto ship replacement filter at $54.00 a pop. called to cancel but told too late to stop shipment. Cancelled auto ship and will have to wait and see if they actually did. Filter arrived, too much of a hassle to ship it back, found a woman with a unit and gave it to her even tho she said she didn't need it.

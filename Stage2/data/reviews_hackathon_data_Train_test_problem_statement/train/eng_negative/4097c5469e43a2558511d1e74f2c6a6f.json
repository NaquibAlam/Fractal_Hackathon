It came to me missing beads and they were not in the packing so they must have fallen off before even making it into the box. I tried on the dress and lost 3 more by just trying it on! I didn't even sit in it. Can you Imagine the amount of beads that will be lost dancing in it? I contacted customer service where I was directed to their bead policy in their terms and conditions. I do understand beads may fall off but to have them missing on a dress before you receive it even is ridiculous. I was offered replacement beads and $40, not even 10% of the cost of the dress for it coming not intact. I was offered a full refund which I might have done if my wedding day wasn't just a month away. I was offered to switch it for the same dress but with a warning it may happen again. I think it shouldn't be common place to receive a dress missing pieces. My concerns I felt were just blown off like that is just how it is. I know Peaches didn't make the dress, but they do choose to sell it and they could let the maker know the issues so it can be addressed.\nUpdate 2/21: The replacement beads they sent were 6 beads they picked up off the floor from other dresses and don't even match the 12+ beads missing off my dress.

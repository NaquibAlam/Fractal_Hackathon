Who on earth would accept this delivery time?\nThe food is lazy and uninspired and made of very cheap ingredients. The amount charged for it is extortion and I estimate their profit margin to be over 900%.\nBasically its the same 10 boring meals over and over with a varying sauce packet. Everything is frozen which makes it mushy and not enjoyable.\nGood for weight loss but would not recommend it for anything else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:57:13.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My friend warned me that she had the same problem but only after I told her I had ordered. It has been a month and I still have never received the item I ordered despite my attempts to make contact. They keep sending BS emails stating that oh we are sending or it has been sent or we will issue you a refund now saying they have to submit the request for refund and then it takes 10 days. Do yourself a favor and never order from here! Worst customer service ever, they will take your money and never send you anything!\nUPDATE TO AMICLUBWEAR REPLY: YES YOU HAVE SENT ME THREE EMAILS INDICATING YOU WOULD RETURN MY MONEY AND NEVER HAVE!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T15:50:16.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

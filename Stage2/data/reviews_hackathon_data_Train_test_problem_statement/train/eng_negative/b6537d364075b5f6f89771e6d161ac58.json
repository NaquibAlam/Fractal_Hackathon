One pan came damaged and a lid was missing. I contacted Groupon immediately to see if I could get the pan and lid replaced. Someone contacted me and told me in one paragraph that they could not replace the items but if I wanted to keep the items as is, they could give me a refund to my original form of payment. Then in the next paragraph said they could give me a Groupon credit. I emailed back to ask for clarification and a completely different person responded and told me they were sending me a return label to return my items. I'm totally confused! It sounds like their employees don't work together and don't know who is or has already answered emails. They completely ignored my question and I haven't heard from them in a couple of days. Beware of purchasing from Groupon; you might have damaged or missing items and a new employee will respond to your concerns with a different answer each time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:32:56.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

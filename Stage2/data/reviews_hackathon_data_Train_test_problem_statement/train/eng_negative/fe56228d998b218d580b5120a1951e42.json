I choose the delivery option which got the parcel delivered within 5 working days. Which would have got there in plenty of time. It is now the 10th March and I have yet to receive his parcel. I have sent 2 tickets in to the site and have received a automated response back, which did not answer my questions at all and just said to wait until the 18th March. I need this issue resolved as soon as possible because my mother has gone without a birthday present and I have paid for this and paid for delivery! But the Customer Service system is making it very difficult and here has been no update on the tracking system since the 21st February. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to ordering from this website again but after his incident I don't think I will be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T21:36:08.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

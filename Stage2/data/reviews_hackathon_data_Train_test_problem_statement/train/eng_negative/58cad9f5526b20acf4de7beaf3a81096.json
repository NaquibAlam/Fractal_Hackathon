I have not received either order. I have lost money on both the orders for no fault of mine and my undue belief on eVitamins.com.\nI have been contacting them thru email, but they have not done anything from their end.\nI try to call on phone, and I always get a recording saying\" No rep is available\" I never get such non-response form other E-Commerce like Amazon. They have reps always available, and they call back immediately, when I ask them to call.\nThis is a shame that such a nonresponsive E-commerce company is allowed to operate their business.\nIt is amazing that eVitamins.com replied to the review in TrustPilot in 10 hrs itelf, while my emails to eVitamins are till pending for few days.\nWhat a facade!\nSuch E-Commerce companies do not belong in the marketplace, who do not want to:\n1. Provide enough reps to answer phonecalls,\n2. Do not want to address concerns of the customers, but just give wishy washy answers,\n3. Do not reply to customers enquiries for days, but have time to respond to survey on TrustPilot immediately,\n4. When Delivery is not made, they wash their hands off.\nCustomers who got their products should feel very lucky, but others who do not get it, should not expect any co-operation from eVitamins.com by writing or by phone calls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T20:35:32.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

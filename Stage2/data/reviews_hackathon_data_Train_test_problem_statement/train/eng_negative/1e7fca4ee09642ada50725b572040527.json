The car was not the model we'd requested and had quite a bit of outside damage, but also was not 'full' of fuel as it should have been, which we didn't realise until we'd driven it away. The car was fine for the week and we returned it in the same condition we picked it up. Only difference was, it was brimming over with fuel, you couldn't have got another drop in it. It was checked by their advisor and she said she was perfectly happy with it and the deposit would be returned. She specifically checked the fuel gauge and said nothing apart from it was all good. NO mention of it being short. We have just checked the credit card and found that Goldcar have taken 48 euros! 8 euros for 'fuel shortage' and 40 euro fine! Absolutely disgraceful. If it was (supposedly) short, how come she said nothing at the time? They now want us to make an online claim and provide evidence of the fuel purchase. How many others have they been ripping off with this scam? My advice? DO NOT hire a car from Goldcar, if you do, take photos of the fuel gauge and mileage before and after hiring it. Do not be a victim of this blatant lie. Will never use this company again. Have hired from Sixt on previous holidays, will be going back to them in future. Hang your heads in shame Goldcar, your staff are a disgrace!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T16:48:02.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

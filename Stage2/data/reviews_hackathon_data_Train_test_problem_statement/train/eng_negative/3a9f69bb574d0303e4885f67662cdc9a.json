I would normally be able to live with something like that, however the guys left a razor knife in the open position on my living room floor. We did not know that it was left there until my wife found my two year-old son with it in his hands while jumping on the couch. He punctured a small hole in the couch. I am happy that is the only thing that happened. He could have sliced himself open , or even worse he could have fallen on it and stabbed himself while he was jumping on the couch. I called customer service to speak with a manager about it and I was told I would receive a call back later on that day. I never even received a call back. This incident could have been very serious and the fact that your customer service representatives didn't even care enough to return my call is very offputting . My experience at the store was fantastic. Paul Schober was my salesman and he was very helpful and made my experience very pleasant . I wish that the delivery experience could have been the same . I am very disappointed at how the delivery experience went. The fact that I didn't even receive a call back is very unprofessional especially with a matter that could have been very serious.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:56:52.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Steve who was my first contact was wonderful and he stuck with me through the whole process. I would give Steve 5 stars. As soon as the process moved west from New York to California and Carmen took over, everything fell apart. The main problem was communication, either confusing or more often just not there. The problem mostly concerned the fact that I have a power of attorney for my non-borrowing spouse. The notary public here and I litterally had to resign the papers four times before closing. And I still have not got my original power of attorney back. Carmen I give no stars at all. Put them together, and add that it took from October to March to complete the process I have to give the overall process two stars. That being said, I still really appreciate Steve's support and help to work everything out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T13:57:42.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

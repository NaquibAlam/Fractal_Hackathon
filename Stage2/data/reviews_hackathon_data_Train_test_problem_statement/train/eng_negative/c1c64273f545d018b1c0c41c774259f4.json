I ordered a pair of IT 40, of what i assumed was a womens sizing as it was advertised in the womens shoe section. The size chart didn't work; after much research, all reputable sights stated that IT 40 was the same as an EU 40. When the shoes arrived they were a size EU 41 mens. After some emailing ssense refused to take any responsibility for the fact that their web sight had inadequate information about the sizing of suicoke; no where did it state that the sizing was male, and the fact that they sent me a different size to what i ordered. They did not offer any recompense on postage or extend anything other than their basic return policy. I will no longer do business with them. This was my first interaction with ssense and i will not recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:46:07.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

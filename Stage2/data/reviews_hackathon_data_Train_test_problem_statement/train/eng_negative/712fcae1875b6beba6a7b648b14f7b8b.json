The worst part was that my booking had no information on it. And when I tried to enter the booking info into their online service it no longer appeared to exist. Their website was completely down. So I was in a different country with no idea where I was picking up my car! I tried calling their various numbers. The New Zealand number didn't exist. Their Australian number didn't exist. And the number in Greece wasn't functioning either. I ended up calling as many car rental companies as I could find in New Zealand and still had no luck. I had already paid a large deposit online upon booking. Finally got through to the number in Greece. They were able to tell me where my car was. I'd already spent most of the day making calls at my own expense.\nThen as mentioned when we picked up the car we owed a lot more money than what we were lead to believe!\nI made a number of written complaints asking for documentation and reconciliation. They avoided any discussion about compensation, sending various emails telling me to check my online booking. They claimed not to understand what my requests were. I wrote them at least ten times. They never provided me with an adequate explanation and they certainly didn't compensate me for the time I wasted or for the additional $$ I spent.\nI find it hard to believe that a reputable car rental company would actually work with these dodgy brokers!\nDo not use them! You will regret it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T01:51:15.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

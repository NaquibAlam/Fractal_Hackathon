Then i rang to find out what was going on, they told me, they couldn't refund my paypal payment, and they didn't even inform me they had put a discrimination mark on my account.\nSo if they send your packages to a non existent address they alleged that Au post charges them to return the item (cough cough I smell a lie) so they want to charge you for return postage and 15% restocking fee.\nThen when paypal investigate and find in your favor PCCG blacklist you, but still take your money on subsequent orders. Only to keep it and not deliver or attempt to contact you. I would say this business practice to be deceitful and deceptive. If it's not a violation of the anti discrimination act, then it sure breaches a few consumer protection laws.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T23:52:46.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They didn't show me the pictures I obliged them to take before pick-up, claiming that there was \"an error in the system\". They didn't send me those pictures at the moment they took them, as they said they would, nor they sent them to me after charging me the scratch. They only sent me a picture taken after I returned the car, depicting the scratch I supposedly did. The car was full of scratches, so when I made them mark every scratch on the paper( most were not marked) they marked a nearby very small scratch making me believe that the small one mark was representing the big one. Then they charged me 200€ for the bigger one.

It's just a plastic bag, really. And they put in as many as will fit -- I've received as many as 6 in one plastic bag.\nThis means that books WILL get damaged in the mail -- dings to corners and edges at the least. All my packages showed evidence of scraping, and in some cases had tiny holes from the scrapes. One book I got had a dent to the spine with a corresponding hole in the bag.\nI'm never buying from Thriftbooks again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:27:30.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

That company is a joke. A Baker could run a freight business better than they are, not to mention that their customer service is good for nothing. They scheduled arrival for Friday (last week), then they changed it to Wednesday this week between 10am and 1pm. It's now 2:45pm and my package is nowhere. They didn't call me, so I called them. I have talked with 5 different agent and none of them could give me an answer for my simple question: Where is my package?\nI don't know if I will get it at all or not, but compare with Amazon or other companies I will definitely not use UFC till this freight \"challenge\" can happen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:43:18.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I got an email telling me there was an issue with my order and that I needed to call them. I don't like to make calls because my recpetion is horrible so I emailed them back about the issue... I finally got a reply and one of the items I ordered wasn't in stock and they had no idea when it would be so I told them to just cancel the order. I got another 'call is' email and I replied instead ... they said they'd cancel it.... then i got a voicemail from someone there and they said they had the item now and did i want to go ahead with the order. I emailed - again - because I thought it had already been canceled and refunded.. I guess not. I got another email saying they'd be happy to throw in a 'free vaporizer or cleaning accessories' if I wanted to go ahead with the order.. i told them that was fine. When the order arrived, my 'free vaporizer or cleaning accessories' were junk tossed in my box.. some cleaning wipes, a cheap wood grinder and some granular cleaning agent... it was all garbage. I appreciate that they tried to make me happy but it fell short. I probably won't order from them again. The items I ordered were fine tho.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:04:50.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

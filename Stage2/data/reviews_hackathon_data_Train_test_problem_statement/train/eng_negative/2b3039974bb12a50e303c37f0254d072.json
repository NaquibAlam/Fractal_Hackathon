Waited 6 days for it to show up. It was the WRONG product and would not fit my bumper. When I called to return it - I found out that I WOULD NOT RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. They would take the shipping charges and then some. So my $32+ cost was only credited $19+. All because their \"expert\" sales person who spent so much time with me STILL couldn't sent me the correct part. That should not be my problem or expense. Do not buy or trust anyone from carID. It will cost you$$!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T22:35:04.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Annoying as this was we were willing to paay the fee, then to be told the car was a peguot 208 when we had book a 4by4! The woman at the desk insisted it was a 'big car' even when confronted with pictures of a 208- absolutely ridiculous!!! We were then told we could not take the car without the premium insurance (which was €50/day!!) which was completely too much at which point we just gave up and requested a refund, which they obviously did not agree to as they are the absolute worst company I have ever encountered. This also seems to be a theme with them so unless you want to get completely ripped off when collecting your car avoid this company at all costs!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T14:21:55.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I received a personal payment into my bank account in CAN, from my sister in the US, through PayPal about a month ago. I tried repaying her from my bank account to her email address through PayPal (the same accounts we used a month ago) and it didn't process. I called to ask what I was doing wrong and how to fix it and was met with a very abrupt \"security blocked it and you have to find another way to send the money\". So I asked to speak to her supervisor, assuming he'd be helpful and he was worse. He spoke to me like I was doing something illegal and told me to find another company. I'm so confused as to why there would be a security concern as I was trying to send money from a big bank - TD, from a chequing account that has money in it, to my sister. Isn't that a service they provide?!? When I told him that his customer service was like me walking into a store and wanting to make s purchase and the clerk telling me to go to another store, he said \"you just said you weren't buying anything\". He didn't even understand the analogy. Honestly - that customer service experience was like a twilight zone experience and it would be funny because so it's so crazy if it didn't now inconvenience me on figuring out an efficient way to send money back to my sister.\nMy advice? Don't use PayPal if you don't have to. Not only are they incredibly rude and not helpful, it makes no sense that it states on the website that personal transactions are free yet when it converted my CAD amount into US when I tried to process the transaction, it was an extra 3.5% when compared to current bank of Canada rates. Sonething is extremely fishy with PayPal. User beware.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:08:15.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

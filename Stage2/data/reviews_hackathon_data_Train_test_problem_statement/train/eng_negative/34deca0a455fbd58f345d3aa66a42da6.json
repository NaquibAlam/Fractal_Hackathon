However, on this occasion, they have been so unhelpful it is almost laughable. I booked through Bravo for flights to and from Indonesia for my honeymoon, departing from Adelaide. The airline had to cancel my flights, meaning I had to book new flights at the airport. The airline informed me I was entitled to a full refund, which they returned to Bravofly.\nThis is where it gets messy. Bravofly recieved my full refund of $1026 AUD in January. Since then, I have called several times, constantly being told that Bravofly is \"looking into the matter\". They have never called me back to inform me of any changes to the situation, as they promised they would. The customer service center will not allow me to speak to any sort of manager or supervisor. Today, the man I spoke to on the phone raised his voice, got angry at ME and told me to wait while they \"continue to look into the matter\". He was so rude that I took his name to make a formal complaint. Almost 2 months later and I am beginning to think that I may as well say goodbye to that money.\nIt was bad enough that my honeymoon started so poorly, with an airline cancellation, but hey, that happens and it's okay. The problem is that Bravofly is now compounding the problem by refusing to send money, that it doesnt even own, back to a customer that until this episdoe was a repeat customer! How can Bravofly justify this in good conscience? $1000 may not be much to a large company, but to the regular family, it is significant and they are having a big impact on people lives.\nUse this company at your own risk, if things go wrong, do not expect a speedy, or even reasonable resolution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T11:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T08:33:38.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This hasn't happened yet so the response below is totally irrelevant.\nThe funniest thing was, she said prices can go up during Valentine's day. Then why don't you just have higher prices on your website instead of delivering a quarter of the flowers on the picture and not even the same flowers!\nI guess the period around Valentine's day is no period to order flowers from Euroflorist from. I have no experience with other periods. If I get a solution from Euroflorist, I'll report that here too. For now, everyone be careful!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:59:36.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

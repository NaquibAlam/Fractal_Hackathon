This entails them automatically taking money out of my account if I do not go into their website and 'skip' the month. They take out $49.95 USD which calculates to approx $70 AUD on a good month, something which I cannot afford when I forget to skip the month however they do not offer refunds on this. The only way to cancel this membership is to call them, something which I haven't gotten around to due to time constraints. On top of this they also charge $9.95 USD for shipping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T21:12:44.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

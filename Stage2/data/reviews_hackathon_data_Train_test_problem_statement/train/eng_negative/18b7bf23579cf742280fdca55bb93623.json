So I had to leave the airport in a taxi 2 hours late and with no car now for my 2 days in Madrid having to spend over €150 in taxis.\nWhen booking the car I was asked for my details for payment and separately details for the main driver (not me) it also asked if I wanted to take out the full insurance pack to avoid any excess charges if the car were to be damaged in any way, which I did. (On a previous trip I have been told this is a must because operators find any way they can to use the excess - on this case €950)\nHowever, when I got to the car rental desk to pick up the car. I was told that I couldn't have the car as my details were not the same as the main driver. Despite it being me who paid for the booking! Nowhere whilst booking did it say this had to be the case. Only that the main driver needed to have their passport, driving licence and a credit card all in their name. Which we did. (If it does say this then it is not very clear at All or very misleading). However, the further excess charge (despite being paid for already had to paid for by the main driver even though that isn't the person who paid for the booking. Again this was never made clear when booking and is very misleading.\nAs we didn't have funds on the main driver credit card to pay the additional €950 I was told I would have to change the booking over to my name and then pay a further €16 for the other person to go on as a second driver. Now 2 hours later I am tired and extremely angry. I asked to talk to a manager at the company who was based in Poland who was extremely unhelpful as were the local car hire company 'firefly' I can now see why their customer rating is so low. I was told that the additional insurance taken for the excess cover would be refunded but the daily charge for car would not. I asked her to send me an email stating this as I would take it further when I returned to England. To this day I have also received no email. A week later after writing my complaint I have still heard nothing from the company.\nThe whole service from landing in Spain is appalling. Why would I pay for extra insurance to avoid further costs if I then have to take out a further one from the hire company or indeed wait up to 4 weeks to receive any refund (if at all?) if it be taken. The whole point of this extra insurance is to avoid any further costs whether they are temporary or not.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T10:03:12.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

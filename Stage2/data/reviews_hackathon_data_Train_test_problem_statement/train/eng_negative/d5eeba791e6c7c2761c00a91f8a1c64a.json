Waited for 7 days and said that it may take more days to unlock it. Waited again and said they cant do it regular price. It has to be $100. Note: Its an iphone 4s!!! That is more than the cost of the phone right now.\nThe worst part is when you asked for refund. They put it as a credit. So, you have to use their service again to get your refund. I dont recommend this to anybody.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:36:42.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

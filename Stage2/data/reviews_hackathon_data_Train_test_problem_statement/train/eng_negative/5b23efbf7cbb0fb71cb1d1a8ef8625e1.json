I had to get the box delivered on a Saturday though, as they only offered day time deliveries on Tuesdays and I didn't want the box to sit out all day when I was at work. Most meals were fantastic, with only a couple I wouldn't make again.\nThen new delivery times were offered and I was glad to change to a weekday morning delivery. The whole point of the service (for me, anyway, though I would imagine the large majority of customers) is convenience, and I have less time on workdays to think about and shop for meals than I do on the weekend. My delivery time was set for Monday between midnight and 7am. 7:00 came and went, no box. I was in a bind - was the box just running late, or was is not coming at all? The temperature that day was 39 degrees and I couldn't really risk it sitting out while I was at work. So I tried calling Marley Spoon, but there was no one to answer the phone. I sent them a message on facebook, noting they were stated to have excellent response times. I continued waiting until after 8am when I had to leave for work. Late to work, missed a meeting, it was not until after 9am when I was contacted back on my message, saying that customer care would shortly be in touch.\nI followed up after 12 as I had still heard nothing. At about 13:15 I was told that the truck had broken down. While I appreciate that accidents happen, there should definitely be a system in place to inform customers. Had I received a text from them during the delivery time I would not have minded. As I receive a text and photo when the box arrives there is clearly a way for the drivers to contact people.\nSue from customer 'care' phoned approximately 30 minutes later. She said a fresh box would instead be delivered the following day, in the midnight-7 timeslot. I was offered a $23 discount off my next box. Then just after 4pm I received a text from them confirming there had been a problem with my box (so helpful, a mere 9 hours after the end of the delivery period) and the box would be delivered tomorrow.\nSo it came as quite a surprise when an hour later a box arrived at my door. It was still 36 degrees outside and it had clearly been in an unrefrigerated van as the contents are hot. There was fortunately a tiny bit of ice left in the cold packs, but had I not been home (and there was no reason I should have been, after all it had only been an hour since I had been told the box (and a new box, not the box sitting in a broken down van the entire incredibly hot day) would be delivered the next day) the contents would have been unusable.\nI again queried Marley Spoon about my issues with their systems - it seemed that the office had zero idea what their delivery team is doing. In addition, both my sisters had signed up on my recommendation and neither of them had received their day's boxes at that point either. I was again told that customer care would be in contact shortly. I heard nothing back, though noted in my account that I had been provided a free box for the following week.\nThen Monday morning I was back in the exact same situation. 7am came and went and again I had no box. This week it was only 36 degrees but not a temperature you can leave perishables out in. So again I was late to work and still had no groceries. I contacted MS again. I was without a box and they had never responded to me last week. I was told that they would be in touch shortly. Lunchtime again rolled around with no contact. I followed up. I then received a call from Sue again. She spent the entire phone call talking about the previous week. She said she had sent me an email and then read it out. I accepted that she had sent it, however it had not arrived. She casually noted that 'oh yes, I see your delivery today is still marked as pending' - but acted as though it is completely fine to not deliver when they say they will. She forwarded me the email and said she would follow up with that day's box, and get back in touch.\nAgain the email noted that my box had not arrived, but said nothing more about it. I followed up this email several times throughout the afternoon but I literally have not heard from them again since. That evening I was out and received a text at 18:45 stating my box had arrived. When I got home 10 minutes later there was nothing at my front door. I checked the photo with the text and realised it was a photo of someone else's box, at a different house. It belonged to a house 2 doors up my street. I immediately phoned MS but of course, could only leave a message. I left a message and sent another email. Slightly over an hour later my box arrived. The delivery guy told me a separate truck had delivered my neighbour's box and had accidentally claimed to have sent mine. So there is definitely some sensible delivery techniques happening here - houses literally metres apart are being serviced by different drivers!\nWhen I opened my box I discovered the ice in the meat/dairy packs was completely melted. Although the van had been refrigerated this time, my box had clearly been out all day (since before midnight, presumably) and again if I had not been home it would not have lasted long outside. I have contacted MS several times since and all of my correspondence has gone unanswered. My sister's box arrived more than 3 hours late yesterday and she has also not received any response from her queries. I am honestly completely astonished that a company would act this way. You would think that a company that exists to provide a service that is almost entirely based on convenience would be able to deliver within a SEVEN HOUR period. It's not like they say your box will arrive at 6am on the dot. They give themselves seven hours and are still incapable of managing it.\nSo while the food is good, it is not worth the hassle. Marley Spoon's customer service and deliveries are so bad that all it will do is raise your blood pressure. Use hello fresh - they at least can deliver on time!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:43:43.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The three year old spayed female is in a first floor apartment in a home with a regular and screened in door plus a gated yard. The WAG walker claims the dog ran from the apartment and burrowed under the fence and ran away. This is uncharacteristic behavior for this animal. WAG did not assist in the search and recovery and did not even post a picture provided on their local website to assist in finding the dog. The dog was recovered sixteen hours later and was treated and released from a vetinary hospital. At no time after the dog got loose did WAG contact my daughter or assist in any way.Know when you do business with this firm that they do not stand up for the animals they pretend to care about!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:06:55.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

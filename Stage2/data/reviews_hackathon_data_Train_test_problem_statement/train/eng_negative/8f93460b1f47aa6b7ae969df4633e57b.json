Every aspect of it is designed to cheat customers out of money. Monthly subscription format is perfect for taking money out from under members' noses. Very difficult to \"skip\" a month and avoid getting charged. A credit is worth about $50, if your order total comes out below a multiple of 50, you will be charged the difference even if you have adequate credit in your account to cover it. This forces you to either pay that difference, or order more to cover it and make the difference smaller. Waited for hours to speak to customer service before giving up. Absolutely brilliant business model in terms of making easy money. I will not be doing business with Fabletics again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:50:37.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

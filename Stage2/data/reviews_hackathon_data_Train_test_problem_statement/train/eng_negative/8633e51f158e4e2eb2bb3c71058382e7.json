I was then hit with a $100 fee and a follow up email invoice to pay the fees (plus -$100 for not selling my tickets). I am sure the buyer is also not happy and was very disappointed they couldn't go to the event due to my honest mistake. Ticketmaster needs to implement a better process to manage this because I am sure it has happened before. It's not a good experience for both the buyer and seller or Ticketmaster's reputation for that matter. Perhaps an auto notification if the uploaded ticket doesnt match the event description. It's 2017, anything is possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:14:47.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The trip is with an SAS flight from CPH and a return flight with Transavia. A couple of months ago Transavia (oh do not even get me started on their non existing customer care) contacted us explaining that they have changed the return flight for the day before. If tis was not suitable for them, Transavia would refund the tickets. Great, we asked for a refund because they wanted to stay that extra day.\nSo now when we ask Transavia where the money is they tell us that they refunded the amount (ca DKK 2500,-) to Tripsta weeks ago. Of course we cannot get trough to Tripstas customer care because it does not exist... so no money no tickets and a bitter taste that we should have been much better at checking the reviews here, because then we NEVER would have chosen a booking agent with a reputation like this.\nStealing is a crime last time I checked", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:19:25.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

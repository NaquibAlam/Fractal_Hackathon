I called and explained the situation and said that I still wanted to go home and see my parents but I wanted his ticket cancelled. I said it very clearly and a few times to ensure that mine would not be cancelled as well. The incompetent person I was on the phone with, cancelled my flight instead of his!!!! On top of that, endless fees were taken to the point where I got no money back from his ticket and I had to pay extra to make sure the ticket is cancelled and he doesn't end up sitting beside me on a 10 hour flight! They were given really clear and specific instructions and it really was an unacceptable experience! After waiting for 1 hour on the phone and talking to 4 different people the problem was finally solved after I had lost all of that money. People who make mistakes on such a mass scale should not be working there!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:10:25.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I ordered it 4 days before valentines day. It was delivered on time(that was good) but something was wrong. The flowers did not look like the pictures on their website. Here's the kicker, the chocolates were nothing i mean nothing like what i ordered! It was just like they got the order, picked some random flower and chocolate and delivered it. I think they actually thought people won't notice, these are people that actually ordered something based on the picture on the website(like any reasonable person). I don't know about anybody else but i spent a couple of days trying to find the right flower based on the damn picture on their website. So what did i do you might ask, I did what even superman would do, I called flora2000, but the line was busy (hmm why oh why). What did i do next I went on their website, and looked for contact information. Guess what it said we are busy just send an email here and here, so convenient, easier for them not to respond. But i wasn't thinking like then, I was like any reasonable human being. It makes sense that they would be busy then, after all it was valentines day. SO I sent an email to Richard (hmm if that's a real person, real people with a heart would respond, unless he's a member of ISIS) and wait and waited. Today I'm sick and tired of waiting. I paid a higher amount for a lower quality product. It's like paying for a Mercedes and getting a Toyota (noting against Toyota but Mercedes is my dream car). My goal now is to go to every review site in the world and tell the whole universe how flora 2000 is nothing more then an organization of thieves!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:42:14.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

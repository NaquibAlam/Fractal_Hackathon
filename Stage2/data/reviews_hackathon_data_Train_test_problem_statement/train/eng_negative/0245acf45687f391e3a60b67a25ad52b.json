They do not care about an agreement. The will break it as soon as possible. I sign up contract for 18 months for 38 euros after 9 months they probably send me an email that price going up for 45. I sey probably because I read this email 3 months later. When I call them and ask whats going on, why I dont get new agreement or post, they told me that their provider rise up the price I say I dont care it is not my business, for me is importent why you break the agreement...I hear this same bulshit about landline provider !

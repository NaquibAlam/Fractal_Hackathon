We were group of 16-18 people, our reservations weren't confirmed under group in any of the hotels and excursions. Many times checked out of hotel by 5:00 a.m. took the flight and at the destination by 10:00 a.m and find out our hotel rooms not available till 3:00 p.m. Hotels have no information to deal with our group at 10:00 a.m. Misleading Hotel details. Upgraded to 4 star hotels and none of the 9 hotels were 4 star.\nDates and timings were wrong on iternaries. So much confusion. We were on the phones everyday to confirm our reservations for excursions and transportations. Few people were taken to wrong hotels, were booked on different tours from rest of the group. Horrible experience. Will never take goway Travels again. Half the people have to ask for discount their representative advised. Really really poor Representative. Beware Goway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T11:07:46.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

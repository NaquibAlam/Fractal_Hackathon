It has been secure and timely until my last experience this week. Since I'm new here and my SSN is for a legal immigrant the information page said it needed to verify my information and took me back to the data page... 4 times instead of the transaction completed page. I gave up and though nothing happened because it never notified me that anything had been completed. Until the next day when I had been notified that I had over drawn my bank account by $1700. Then when I called transferwise they said they could do anything to stop it because it had gone through in the less than 24 hours since I filled out the order. I then had to call my bank in Canada and learned they transfer money for free internationally. I sent back the thousands of dollars transferwise withdrew and overdrew from my account but lost $60 from the change in exchange from the day. Transferwise' faulty website, helpless customer service and my own mistake thinking nothing happened caused me to have no money in my American account for days and I was not compensated for their faulty software. If an order needs time to be verified it's fine. But my problem is it never notified me I made four transactions instead of one. I was just taken back to the same data page over and over again. That's incredibly irresponsible from a company that is trying to grow a positive reputation. And the fact that customer service said the only thing I could do was call me bank and ask them to block the transfer, and now I'm down $60 is a bit of a sting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:16:02.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

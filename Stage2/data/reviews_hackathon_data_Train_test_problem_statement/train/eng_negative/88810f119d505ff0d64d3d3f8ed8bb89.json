The hotel was meant to be a 5 star luxury hotel. Arrived at the destination and despite having paperwork confirming my 5 star hotel, I was told there was no booking for me.\nI called Amoma customer services who had said their chosen company had made a mistake. Amoma have done nothing to help me and I had to go to my credit card company to get my money back.\nAmoma are just a online platform that farm out your booking to another company. If your abroad and it goes wrong there is nothing they can or will do to help if stranded.\nI recommend booking with more well known companies. Rather than risk going abroad and spoiling your trip.\nThere are other reviews I have found regarding this company for the exact same thing.\nSearch all the 1 star ratings and see for yourself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:50:33.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

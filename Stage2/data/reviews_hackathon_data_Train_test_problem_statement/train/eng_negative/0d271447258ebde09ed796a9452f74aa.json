Spot a home assigned me their agent.\nAfter several days of searching we finally found a very good offer so I said to this guy to go ahead with the request. From that on everything went wrong:\n1. The landlady couldn't met one of our petitions, so she told him that she agreed to have us and the decision was on us, so he called us. Then he said that he was calling me the next morning in order to confirm if we wanted to take the place or not, however he didn't call me at all.\n2. After several hours, I decided to call to spot a home and ask for him, just to find this guy wasn't at the office and did't even go to work that day.\n3. There was another person saying me she was going take control of my process since my assigned agent didn't work that day. She said she was sending an e-mail to me within 15 minutes with the confirmation and the landlady contact details, but after 3 hours she hadn't sent me anything.\n4. I decided to call again just to have to speak with a totally different person, which didn't even know about my process, what shows that there was not records of what was happening, thus I had to explain everything again from scratch.\n5. After another 3 hours, a FOURTH NEW PERSON, sent me an email in behalf of my assigned agent, saying that the landlady had already rented the apartment to another person, probably because she was tired of waiting a call from this agency that came too late.\n6. This new agent offered me a different option, not only 200 euros more expensive but also A PROPERTY I HAD ALREADY DISCARDED IN MY PREVIOUS PROCESS, which proves the lack of basic communication and professionalism of this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T21:06:02.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I like i Australia & ordered santa presents for my two girls & god children on 26th nov. got emails stating goods being delivered. Arrived in Ireland at 10pm Christmas Eve to discover the delivery was not made. Had to try to experience to disappointed children that it wasn't they're fault santa didn't deliver. Since then I have been emailing regularly demanding a refund. The response is usually 1-2 weeks late, by a different person, they ignore any requests made ie to get senior staff to contact me directly, to refund my bank. They avoid answering any questions or demands, offer no apology and respond requesting additional ridiculous details eg proof of non delivery or state the refund has been made - which is not true, with screenshots of evidence that no refund has been made sent to them regularly. I'm so frustrated with the process of dealing with them and would never purchase from them again and urge anyone who is considering it to save yourself the stress of being robbed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:43:19.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was told that this is clearly on the website and that I obviously hadn't I read it properly...apparently the 'only' thing she could do was offer me a discount (a measly 10%) off a replacement pair. In essence buy another pair of blinds.\nRubbish, rubbish, rubbish. Why would I even consider spending any more money with this company if they can't get it right in the first place. I told her this was not a satisfactory resolution for me and I would either want a replacement pair of blinds made to my original measurements or a full reimbursement because they are faulty - she wouldn't agree to either and now I am hundreds of pounds out of pocket.\nWhile on the call, I checked what they actually state on the website, a short phrase (which wasn't that easy to find) says that the company does indeed deduct some off the measurement 'to create a perfect fit'!!!! This is completely laughable as it wasn't a perfect fit at all.\nWhat Blinds2go clearly don't know is how wide or narrow the window frames are, so the blinds I received do not fit anywhere near perfectly and I have large strips of light coming in each side....they do not create a nice dark room and look ridiculous because they are clearly too narrow.\nMy final point to the women was that if my measurements were incorrect I would take full responsibility for this, but, as Blinds2go had taken it upon themselves to reduce the width creating a far from perfect fit they would need to rectify it. She repeated all she could do was give a discount off a replacement pair.\nI am completely astonished by this apalling customer service and inability rectify an error which is theirs...\nPlease do not give them your custom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:48:34.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

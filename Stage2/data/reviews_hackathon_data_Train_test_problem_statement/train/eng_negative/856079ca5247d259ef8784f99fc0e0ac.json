The following timeline then just dwindled at a downward spiral. My furniture took 3 weeks to come in, I had to go to another store. Then the store did not have all of the paid furniture so I had to revisit the main store I bought from, only to be told that my furniture was not in. 1 week later I called and they told me that they had no record of me missing anything, when I explained I had already spoken to Randy about the situation they said oh okay, well your night stand has been here. It seems as though the organization of the company is very poor, the prices are great deals but the hassle to get the furniture afterwords is stressing. I recieved my headboard that was suppose to fit my queen bed, and low and behold it's too big, not all of the bolts were including in the installation as wells overall I feel I would rather pay more somewhere else than come again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:07:42.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

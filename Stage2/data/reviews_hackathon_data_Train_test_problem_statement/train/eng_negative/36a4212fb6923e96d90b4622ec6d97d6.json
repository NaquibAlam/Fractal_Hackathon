But after they mishandled one of my package, whatever 'good' words I had to say about them has gone down the drain. After consolidating one of my packages and depositing money in my account to ship this package, nothing happens. This package had goods worth $400 USD.. I logged onto my account only to find a support ticket for a Missing Package (they never bothered to email me to let me know that my package was missing and I was waiting around for it for nothing). TWO MONTHS have passed of back and forth conversations with their 'customer service' team, who keep advising me they will contact such and such person for them to get back to me. THEY NEVER DO. Now they are holding my money that I paid for the deposit on the shipment, despite putting in two requests to have that refunded weeks ago. The package is missing, presumably stolen, and despite them listing photos in my account of the consolidated package, they are requesting that I prove to them what was in fact in that package. No refund on my shipping deposit, and no compensation for a lost package. No communication, going around in circles every time which ends up nowhere. They have scammed me of almost $500 US dollars and refuse to do anything about it. STAY AWAY! Do NOT open an account with these guys they are frauds and would do anything to keep your money or to avoid accountability for their errors! I have contacted my bank and got all my shipito transactions as listed as fraudulent so I can receive at the very least, some compensation for my wasted time, money and effort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:06:05.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

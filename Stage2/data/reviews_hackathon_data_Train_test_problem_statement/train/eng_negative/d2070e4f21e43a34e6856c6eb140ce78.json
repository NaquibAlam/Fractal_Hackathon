(This was one flight out of two I booked together, the 2nd being with another airline). The Kiwi.com website gave me the option (like on the Norwegian.com website) of paying extra to put baggage in the airplane's cargo hold. Kiwi.com charges alot more for this option than Norwegian.com's website but that isn't my complaint. When you pay extra with Norwegian.com you are paying for being able to 1) take hold luggage, 2) a seat reservation and 3) for a meal. BUT when you pay extra with Kiwi.com for hold luggage it doesn't mention you are getting a meal and it does not provide the option to pay extra for a meal. This meant that my 10 hour flight from London to Los Angeles resulted in me not being fed and having to walk up to the galley to ask repeatedly for water, despite having paid approximately Â£65 for one hold luggage. Needless to say I have just spent 24 hours in bed with dehydration and a chill/fever. Is Norwegian.com or Kiwi.com to blame? Both I'd say. (After contacting both they each blame one another) I won't be using either again and I recommend no-one else bother because neither are good value if you value your health and sanity. Norwegian.com might have a new fleet of planes that look good on the outside but everything on the inside is bad, that's why they are cheap. Next time I'll pay a little but more to be treated like a normal human being. Absolutely no respect for these 'people'.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T20:29:55.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

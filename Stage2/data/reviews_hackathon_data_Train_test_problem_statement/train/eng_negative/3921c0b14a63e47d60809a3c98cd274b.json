My son hadn't received a confirmation email by the following Monday morning so he called Bravofly to confirm. Shortly after his phone call he received a confirmation email from Bravofly and immediatley noticed his girlfriend's surname had a missing letter at the end of her name (the misspelling is questionable in itself). He immediately called Bravofly again and the agent he spoke to said they would take care of the correction and send an email to confirm. Based on my son's conversation with the agent at Bravofly, he assumed this was a minor change and it would be a non issue. Three weeks later he finally receives a follow up email from Bravofly with a change request fee of approx $319 to correct the spelling of his girlfriend's name (they basically had to book a new ticket). My son initially contacted Bravofly within the 24 hour time frame when he could have cancelled the flight and booked a new one without any fees. However, Bravofly assured him the name could be changed and NEVER mentioned a change fee. My son would have absolutely cancelled the flight before paying a $319 fee. I spent several hours on the phone with Bravofly today to resolve. They said they'd send another request to correct the name and see if the change fee could be reduced. In the meantime I called the airline (TAP Portugal) to find out if they could make the correction in the name without a ridiculously high fee. They told me their hands were tied since my son booked through Bravofly and any changes would have to be made through Bravofly. At the airlines suggestion, I called Bravofly again about the fees and they said I'd have to speak to the airline Keep in mind when my son first contacted Bravofly it was within the 24 hour cancellation period so he could have easily cancelled his flight had he know Bravofly would mysteriously add on these fees. Here are the many complaints:\n1. Original email confirmation was not sent until my son requested it.\n2. When my son finally received the email confirmation, well within the 24 hour cancellation period, he noticed his girlfriend's surname had a missing letter at the end of it so he called Bravofly immediately to correct and add the one missing letter, yet they NEVER mentioned there would be a fee (he would have cancelled and rebooked a new flight had he know).\n3. My son received no follow up correspondence for 3 weeks (again, had he know there was an issue he would have been contacting Bravofly frequently),\n4. When I was so fed up and inquired about canceling the reservation I was told by the agent at Bravofly they'd have to put in a cancellation request and wait to hear back re: cancellation fees. I'm assuming that would take yet another 3 weeks before my son hears back from Bravofly.\nI will be in contact with Bravofly again on Monday (it's ridiculous you cannot reach anyone on a weekend). Something unethical is going on with Bravofly and we will get to the bottom of it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T18:07:20.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

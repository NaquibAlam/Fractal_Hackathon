They give you 5 days a month to \"skip\" and if you don't skip in that period you're charged for another month. It's impossible to cancel. You have to wait for a representative to chat with and even then they get snarky - god forbid you forget about the chat for 30 seconds while you wait to be attended to. They will leave you. If that isn't enough, the clothes are not that great. Do not start a membership with them unless you have an hour every month to chat with someone about skipping or you'd like to take the better part of a day to cancel something you don't use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:56:34.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

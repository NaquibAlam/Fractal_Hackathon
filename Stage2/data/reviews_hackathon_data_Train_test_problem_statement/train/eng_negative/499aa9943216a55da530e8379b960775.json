After Dad realized what had happened, he tried to go back to Frontier (because of the lower price), and they were scheduled to come to his house yesterday, but never showed up. I, (his daughter) called Frontier yesterday afternoon from Dad's house and spoke to a Frontier customer service rep. I relayed the scenario to her and she put me on hold and then came back and said she had spoken with a tech in our area who was close by and that he would be coming to the house within 10 minutes, he wouldn't need to come inside, but would only need to do something on the outside of the house. She also told me to go ahead and switch the lines inside the home back to Frontier's modem right then. As soon as I did that, Dad's phone service was lost and we waited and waited, but no one ever showed up. We tried calling Frontier many times and but no one answers and it is a waste of time hearing that the menu has changed, etc. over and over. It would have been wonderful to get a \"real person\" on the line. They simply will not answer our calls and now Dad has no service and cannot make calls. Heads up, people. This is definitely not the kind of service you'll want to be stuck with!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:58:04.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

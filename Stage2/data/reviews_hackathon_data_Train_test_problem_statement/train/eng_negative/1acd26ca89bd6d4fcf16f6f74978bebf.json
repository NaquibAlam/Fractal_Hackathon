The contract said that a deposit of US$400 was needed to rent the car. Here stated my nightmare with this company. In my credit card appears a pending charge of US$614.83 not the US$400 mentioned in the contract; that's an overcharged of US$214.83. Second, we already returned the car 6 days ago and my pending is still on my credit card when I was told at the Budget/Avis counter it will be release 3 days after the card has been returned. We are have been in contact via email with Rentalcars.com and by phone today, but received unsatisfactory answers: no response yet - we need to wait 28 days - and no answer from Avis/Budget in Chile and couldn't get through when they called today. I'm sorry this is ridiculous. No follow up to their emails? No follow-up phone calls. We called the Calama Airport and got straight through. Avis/Budget Calama is not accepting the Rentalcar.com reference number,so we have to wait an hour for them to check and call us back. Of course no one will offer to reimburse us for the international phone calls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:53:01.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

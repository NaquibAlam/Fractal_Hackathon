Already issues after having the device a couple of days. Information incorrect for install, $170.00 higher install price than I was told, and each time I have called my rep and/or to talk to someone, no response, waiting for an operator with my phone using minutes. waited 20 minutes nothing. This is not acceptable. My device just showed a .017 reading when leaving work. No alcohol. Hadnt eaten anything for an hour. Also, I was told the re tests would be every 30-40 miles and I was tested approx 5-6 times in one trip, which is not safe. It is illegal to talk/text and drive so how can this be legal?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:36:20.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Yes, I got a great design, the design team was quick and pretty much got what I wanted. My logos and other items were finished in a timely manner. If you need help or have questions the chat people suck, can't spell and are jerks! I had one person named Morgan. If you get her, you can expect complete rudeness and illiteracy from her. I have sent several questions and received no response. They made it seem like it was easy for people who aren't as computer literate as others, and it isn't. The designs aren't as easy as entering your info into the business card and boom, your done. You can't change or move icons and I was told \"well it is easy\" Nice customer service. Anyway, if you are an expert you will probably be fine with this company, if not I wouldn't suggest them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T10:11:44.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

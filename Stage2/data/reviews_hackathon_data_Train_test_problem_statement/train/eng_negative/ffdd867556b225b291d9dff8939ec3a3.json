I had initial rental contract for 3 days. As my husband caught a severe flu, we got stuck at home in Canberra and could not drive a car back to Sydney (we have a baby daughter and I could not neither leave her with my sick husband nor drive with her). So eventually we had to extend our contract to 14 days, but we had to pay it using our initial daily rate, i.e. $116 per day... Having experience with other rental companies, where the rate was adjusted according to the actual rental period, I am very disappointed with RedSpot staff being so inconsiderate in this unfortunate and unexpected family situation. Also, we had to wait more than one hour to get our rental agreement ready. Waiting so long was the last thing we were willing to have after a long flight from Europe. I will never rent there again, as I have paid them already too much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:56:49.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

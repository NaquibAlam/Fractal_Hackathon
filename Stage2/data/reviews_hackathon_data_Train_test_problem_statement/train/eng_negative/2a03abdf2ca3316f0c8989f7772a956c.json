When delivered three guys brought in piece by piece to assemble; saying they don't usually assemble and would just need to look over directions to try and assemble. There were scratches and poor quality. Called salesman and store manager (Taylor) who was actually rude, neither could do anything. I had the delivery guys take back, piece by piece. Took over two weeks to finally deliver one that was actually assembled before brought to my home.\nIt has been six days since Gardner White said they would be in contact with me. As of Monday, March 20, 2017 no one has contacted me. Once again, poor customer service. They can't even followup as they said they would.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T13:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:57:52.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

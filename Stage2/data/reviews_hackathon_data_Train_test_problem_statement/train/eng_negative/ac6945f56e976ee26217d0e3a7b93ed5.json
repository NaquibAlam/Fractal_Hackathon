At that first call, I was put on hold for 30 minutes. I agreed to the changes and requested that a new itinerary be sent to me. They never did. Two days ago, they sent me another email to call them about a \"waiver\". I thought it was a different issue. So I called them last night and was put on hold 45 minutes. After waiting all that time, the FlightHub rep told me that she could not update my itinerary for that very same change as the first time, and told me to call back to confirm. At that time, I lost my temper and reprimanded them for their incompetence and that I would never book with them. This morning I contacted the airline directly. The whole call took less than 5 minutes and a revised itinerary was emailed to me right away. FlightHub has a lot of room for improvement in their customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T02:30:21.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

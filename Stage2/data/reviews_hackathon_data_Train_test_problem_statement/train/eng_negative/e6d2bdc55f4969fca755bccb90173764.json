They simply sent me used gift cards. Whether it's due to incompetence or if they got their gift cards stolen by hackers I don't know.\nI have screenshots of both instances as proof since I see people with similar experiences here being discredited.\nI've had to contact PayPal to dispute the payment, we'll see how it goes from there.\nUpdate: Got a refund from PC Game Supply, but this also means they're not able to supply the gift cards I need and aren't able to service a paying customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T15:01:33.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After reading through a number of reviews I was quite keen to get to grips with the Green Belt Six Sigma Course offered by E Careers. Unfortunately the method of delivery is so poor that it made learning very difficult.\nInitially I perservered thinking that maybe the problem lay with my expectation, however after 6 weeks of heavy readingI am at the point of giving up and chalking the cost up to experience. I have been a military instructor , as well as being heavily involved in training air traffic controllers and drone pilots I think I do have a reasonable idea of what constitutes effective training and this is not it.\nMy issues are threefold\n1) for nearly £200 I get a pdf of a book and power point slides which essentially is the exact wording in the book simply converted to powerpoint. This is not training , there is no opportunity to talk to someone if you get stuck and initially I had to go online to find other means of explaining concepts in the book. Finally there is only a loose sense of order to the instruction e.g COPQ is mentioned within the first few lessons but you do not get to understand what COPQ is until later.\n2) The course involves the use of a program called Sigma XL which has a significant cost , this is not mentioned at any point during the signup process.\n3)There is no means to question a qualified person to explain concepts that require clarification. The book refers to your mentor several times but no mentor has been assigned . Likewise noone has contacted me to see how I was progressing.\nIn my eyes £200 for a book is extremely expensive and I am so glad I did not sign up for the exam at the end of it which would have cost a further 3-400 pounds. The other training courses E Careers provide may be better but I cannot in good conscience recommend them as a training provider based on my experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:52:11.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

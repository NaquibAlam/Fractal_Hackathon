(One would reasonably assume this means from the time of order). There was no indication on the page whatsoever that there was a backorder or delay in items, or that they were out of stock. It was 11 business days before I received my order.\nWhen I contacted dresslily requesting a refund of the express shipping fee due to the items arriving well outside of the express shipping timeframe, they refused. their excuse that it was to do with the supplier having a back-order and not being able to ship them in time, but that, once shipped, the items still arrived within 7 business days of when they were shipped out.\nNowhere on the item's page was it noted that the item was on back-order or that there would be a delay in processing my order before it shipped it. It is misleading to lure customers into paying extra for items.... Most people pay for express shipping because they need the items for a particular day/event, and would not pay the extra if they knew that they would not arrive.\nDresslily refused to refund me what I paid for the express shipping and their response was (in their words):\n\"We are sorry to tell you we can't refund you the money you paid for the shiping. Due to the item you ordered is popular demand, it need a little bit longer processing time. We have already paid the freight to the carrier. So please understand that we can't give you a fefund. Because the items are supplied to us by the suppliers. The supplier have't supply the item timely due to back-ordered. We hope to your understanding and offer you our as\u001fsurance of better service in the future.\"\nBasically, it took a week to process my order before they even shipped it out. Good customer service would have been to refund me the entire charge for the express shipping fee that I paid, but instead they have blamed 'a supplier' and refused to take ownership or provide good customer service.\nWill not be ordering from dresslily again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:24:30.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

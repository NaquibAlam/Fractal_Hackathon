Usually a car rental company only blocks the amount. When I pointed that out to the lady at the counter and asked her to please explain, she treated me very hostile. She grabbed my creditcard out of my hand, put it in the machine and told me I wouldn't get the car or my money back, if I didn't press my PIN-number and payed the deposit now.\nSo I did.\nWhen I got the deposit back after my rental was over, I got about 70 euroes less, because I got it at another conversion rate. This I had absolutely no power over.\nAll in all it ended up being much more expensive than other car rental companies at the airport.\nA really bad way to start and end a holiday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T14:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:46:13.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

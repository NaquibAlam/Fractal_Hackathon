I said that would be fine. But then they told me that I would need to pay an additional amount for the better quality of flowers. I instantly felt uncomfortable. It was as though they called to try to upsale me. So, I asked them to cancel the order. They \"supposedly\" cancelled the order. But then I received a text saying that my flowers were shipped. I was charged 109 bucks and was not supposed to be charged. I spent two days talking to different reps and noone would help me. I also noticed on my card that I was double charged. So I spent another week trying to get my card credited back as well. They finally resolved the issue but I wasted hours on the phone and weeks of trying to get my money back. This was truly a nightmare issue and I would never recommend Avas flowers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:22:58.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

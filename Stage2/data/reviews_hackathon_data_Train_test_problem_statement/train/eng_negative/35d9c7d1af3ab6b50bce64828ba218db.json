However, since I was not a realtor I had no support on how to do the paperwork and the rest. The realtor assigned to us was not very helpful because you could only email him or else he would charge $25 everytime you called. So the buyer's realtor had all the leverage and could totally take advantage of us. If it wasn't for a realtor friend of mine helping us negotiate and fill out the paperwork correctly, we would have been in trouble.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T10:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:52:58.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

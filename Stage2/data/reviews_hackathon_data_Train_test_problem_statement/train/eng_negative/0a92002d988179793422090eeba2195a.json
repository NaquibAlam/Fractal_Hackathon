I had to wait two weeks for delivery as it is shipped from China. The battery was not the correct one for the Kindle Fire (which is what I had ordered). To contact the company, I had to find the ABN, and contact that way. I emailed them, they informed me I must send the battery back to China. I replied no, I purchased from AU company, and I mailed the battery to the address from ABN.\nA month later, no refund. I emailed the company. No reply. As the payment was thru paypal, I contacted paypal to dispute. First person made me repeat info I gave to auto attendant, then go thru the story. She then transferred me. Second person made me repeat my info, then go thru the story. He told me he would file dispute, notify battery company, and 10 days to have them respond. He also asked re tracking no. of return. I informed him that battery company did not tell me to obtain tracking no. and I did not wish to pay extra to return the item.\nSeveral hours later, I get an email from paypal demanding I provide information about dispute including tracking no. I email a reply, for the 3rd time providing the explanation.\nThis morning I have an email from paypal demanding that I go to their website and provide details re dispute including tracking no. If I fail to do so, the dispute will be dismissed.\nThe obvious paypal strategy is to wear people down. By demanding repeating explanation of details, and wasting my time, they plan to make me give up. No doubt it is effective for a percentage of disputes.\nThis is wrong. I will never use paypal again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:22:46.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Â£2400 for family of 4) and started chatting to an online adviser, who offered to call me if I wanted to proceed with the booking. When he did, we spent about 30-40 minutes on the phone, he took all my credit card details, names, dates of birth, passport numbers for the whole family, ran through the flight details very carefully etc and I assumed that the 'deal was done' and the tickets were in the bag. Later that night I got a text telling me to check my email, and when I did my heart sank. Not only was it from Bravo Fly (who I had read horror stories about previously- I hadn't realised they own the Last Minute group), but it just said something along the lines of 'due to a technical error your booking request has been cancelled'. No explanation, no attempt to try again, no offer of alternative flights etc. So bizarre! And to say that it was just a booking 'request' not an actual booking. Why would they not try to sort out the problem? I think the flights (which admittedly were a good price, maybe too good to be true) were never actually available at that price - but I still don't understand why they would waste my and their time over something that didn't exist. Just relieved that I hadn't immediately booked connecting flights, car hire etc after booking. Beware booking flights with this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:31:49.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

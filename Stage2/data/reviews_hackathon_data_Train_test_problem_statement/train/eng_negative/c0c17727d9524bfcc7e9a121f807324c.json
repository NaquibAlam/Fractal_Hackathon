My consultant, Darlene Ruiz, assured us the orders would be delivered well before February 14th. After a few weeks many of us didn't get our orders and it was one excuse after another. Eventually, some of my guests cancelled their orders and requested refunds. One guest sent Darlene a message to cancel her order and then notified her credit card company and they credited her account. She then placed an order online directly with PR and received her order in a few days. But the credit card company reversed the credit after Darlene contacted them. So Darlene had time to contact the credit card company to get money she is not entitled to but has not had time to issue refunds. Some of my other guests still have not received their orders or their refunds after multiple requests for refunds. When I contacted PR I was told I needed to contact Darlene. PR sent me a missing item from my order after I provided a receipt and they also let me make a complaint. They could not help me get my friends and family their refunds though. I will not order anything from PR again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:30:13.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

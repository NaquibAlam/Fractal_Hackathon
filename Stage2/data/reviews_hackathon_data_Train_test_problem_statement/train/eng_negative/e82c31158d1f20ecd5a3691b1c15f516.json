I rang their customer service numbers and they all kept ringing out. After putting a complaint on this website (three weeks after my order), I had my first response from them advising me that I would have a shipping number. Keep in mind that this was due for delivery within 10 -15 days.\nA customer shouldn't have to write on this to get an order number / confirmation / response from a store.\nThe company don't answer their phone nor do they have a voicemail facility.\nI eventually received the chairs I ordered a couple of weeks after the delivery timescale they state on their website - two of four are good quality and the other two came with the wrong screws lengths.\nThey need to improve on their customer service. Instead of apologising and correcting their customer service - they reported my review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:58:22.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

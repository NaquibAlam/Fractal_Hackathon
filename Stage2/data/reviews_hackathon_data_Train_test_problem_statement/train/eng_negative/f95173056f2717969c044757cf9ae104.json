When I received the sunglasses, I could not wear the sunglasses as I got dizzy instantly due to distortion in the lenses. I tried a few times in case I needed to \"get used to the prescription\" but this should not have been necessary as I comfortably wear glasses with the same prescription on a daily basis. I called the Vision Direct 1800 number and I was told that I had to take the brand new sunglasses to an optometrist to be tested at my cost. This report was then to be sent to Vision Direct before they would decide if they would do anything to address the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T12:45:00.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

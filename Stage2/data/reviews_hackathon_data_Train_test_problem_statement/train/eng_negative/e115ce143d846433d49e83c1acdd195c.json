Didn't worry too much as my youngest has only just turned 2 and likes to sleep in a big bed with her sisters, the room we booked was 2 x queen size beds so thought no problem. Phoned lastminute.com to ask them to add my 2 year old to the booking, they said ok and they'd email the hotel to request it. In my mind I thought worse thing is they may charge a little more, which of course is no problem. Couple of days later I then get an email from them stating my request to amend my booking has been declined and so my booking remains the same. I immediately called them to be told that they had tried to contact the hotel to no avail and so the request to amend my booking couldn't be granted. Aparantly I was supposed to travel with 2 of my daughters and leave my third behind??!! They then told me they would try again in 3 days to contact the hotel and then would get back to me. I asked why in 3 days time, why not several times a day, I was put on hold and then when the lady came back I was told they will be in touch with me by 72 hours (another way of telling me 3 days!) and so I still have no idea if I can stay at the hotel or not, yet they're telling me I can't cancel either. We fly out on 29th March I can honestly not get my head around the mentality of this company!!!! I got very stressed in the end and so said it's fine I will wait and then I hung up, I've now emailed the hotel directly in the hope of getting some sense from them!!!! I honestly wouldn't be bothered if my request was something like 'can you please add breakfast to my booking' or 'can we get an early check in' but we are talking about turning up in New York with the possibility of been turned away from the hotel because they won't let my 2yr old daughter stay!!!! The lady on the phone quite frankly didn't seem at all bothered!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T20:38:51.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

One of the shirts I had selected was apparently not compatible with the printing I wanted. They then suggested an alternative to which I responded and said: Yes, please proceed. It took me a further week to get hold of someone and tell them to complete the order; when I did, there was little apology, no offer to bring the delivery forward and no incentive for me to place an order with them ever again. In the end my product arrived 10 days late and I had to do all the leg work to sort it out. Not impressed.\nNow, it was a very simple logo and only one colour so my thoughts are this:\n1) Why was I allowed to choose that garment in the first place?\n2) Why did it take until the day of DELIVERY to tell me there was a problem?\n3) Why did I have to do the legwork to sort it out? They said to respond to the email - I did and that reply clearly sat with no-one actioning it or keeping me in the loop.\nThe product is good. Customer service is crap.

If it had shipped that day or the next, I would have gotten it on time. When it didn't arrive by the day I needed it, I called Transcat. The person who took my call was very polite and helpful, and assured me it would be shipping the following Monday. When it still hadn't arrived three days later, I called again. Again, a pleasant enough experience, and the rep had to look into it and called me back, which he actually did. They said they had just gotten the part in that day, and it would be shipping later that day. I called the next day, and they said that they had just shipped it out that morning (not the day before as I was told). When it finally arrived, it was almost three weeks later than when I needed it. Despite the polite representatives, I was given a run-around time and time again, and wound up with an angry customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:29:53.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

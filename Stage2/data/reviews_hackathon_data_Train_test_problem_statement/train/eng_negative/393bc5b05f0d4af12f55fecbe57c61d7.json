Took on Europcar courtesy car for 2 and half days. Handed back and within a week received a letter from Europcar alleging Â£550 plus worth of damage.\nAs a first time hirer of car ( husband normally deals) I did not thoroughly check vehicle beforehand - I actually trusted Europcar- silly, silly me!!\nOver several months I tried to fight it - even went to Ombudsmen BVRLA but Europcar are very careful with paperwork- you cannot fight their claims. They are thoroughly dishonest and just want to rip people off!\nDo not accept car until you have thoroughly checked and only hand bank with Europcar agent present. ( I left with Hyundai who had arranged car - left in garage for hours but I'm still responsible for it).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:09:55.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

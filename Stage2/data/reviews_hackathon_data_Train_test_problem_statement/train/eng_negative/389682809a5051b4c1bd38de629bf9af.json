Servicing Stop have no power if you're not happy with your service. For example, I did not get my service book stamped nor did I receive any detailed breakdown of parts used !!! Both are needed to validate my warranty but apparently Servicing Stop will ONLY request from garage if the customer requests at time of booking !!! I was never given this option and in the 30 years I have serviced cars I have ALWAYS received a breakdown of what they've done and what a garage has used. Needless to say I am now stuffed with my warranty and will never use Servicing Stop again!\n*** UPDATE ***\nTotal lack of customer service! Despite leaving my phone number and emailing at least 10 times, to date (3 weeks later) all I have received is their automated / copy and paste response of we are sorry to hear about your experience, please get in touch with us, blah, blah", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:19:15.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

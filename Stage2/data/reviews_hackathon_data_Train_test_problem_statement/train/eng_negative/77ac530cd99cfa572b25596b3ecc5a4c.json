Site gave me 1 hour to complete the transaction. I tried for the entire hour to place an order. It let me choose one pair, then It would repeatedly say website not responding. I kept trying on my laptop and got the same response. I also tried on my tablet and my phone and got the same response. I tried to checkout as I was going to add a second pair of the same thing as it would not let me order the other pair I wanted. I couldn't change my total items. In the last 4 minutes it finally let me add a second pair but it was not the color I wanted and also would not let me have the inseam that I wanted. It would not change. There was no phone number to try to get help. This was a totally unsatisfactory experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T13:34:41.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

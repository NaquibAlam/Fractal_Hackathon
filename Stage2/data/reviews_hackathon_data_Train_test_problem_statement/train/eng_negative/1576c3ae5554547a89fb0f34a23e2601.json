Both times I encountered signifcant issues and delays. When you're spending thousands of dollars you do not want this type of unprofessionalism. I shipped a purse to my European address because I was told it could not be shipped to the US. Then I watch it's path through customs from Canada and it passed through the US first. Then went to Europe then bounced back to US then back to Europe and I watched this happen three times! Meanwhile my bag is subject to being tossed around and summer heat and who knows what other potential damage.\nMy other order was botched as well. I tried to order a pair of shoes. I was leaving town Friday so thought it'd be better to send to my permanent address so I asked to change the address. Sales girl said this isn't possible and to instead re order shoes in a different size (mine only had one pair left) and that she could\nSwap the sizes but not address. So I ordered the second pair in a random size. Then I KID YOU NOT. The second pair ships. And I call AGAIN and the rep said oh sorry the warehouse sent it before I could make the change. So I had a pair of random shoes going to an address I was leaving in two days and the correct pair wasn't even en route. Then I have to cancel the correct order and repurchase it with new shipping address. I have to do this over the phone of course. I give my card number and it doesn't work. So I call the bank and they said they blocked it because SSENSE charged me FIVE TIMES for one pair of shoes. So I had to deal with that bank mess. Call SSENSE back and order the shoes. After all that both pairs ended up delivered Thursday so I didn't need to change anything after all and could've sent them to my current address-thanks a lot for that bogus ship estimate. See how convoluted that is? Had to spend hours on the phone sorting it too. Absolutely ridiculous. Yoox mytheresa farfetch netaporter ALL better options. Not dealing with the incompetence and the unprofessionalism that's borderline shady. It was so bad it made me question the authenticity of the items and that freaked me out even more.

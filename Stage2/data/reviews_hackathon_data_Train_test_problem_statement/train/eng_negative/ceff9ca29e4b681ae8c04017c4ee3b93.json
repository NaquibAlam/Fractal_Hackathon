The price Quote: d on the website at the time of booking was $1,060.51. I had taken a screenshot of the purchases to show by boyfriend the deal I had found. However, when the transaction was processed, the price we were both charged was actually $1,178.51. This is a price difference of $118 each. There was no pop-up to prompt me of the price increase before accepting the charges. I found that very misleading as I was not notified of any price increases prior to confirming the purchase. After contacting customer care, I was told there was nothing they could do to rectify the situation as the prices come from the airline. I had even sent them the screenshot of the lower price and they said they could not use that as evidence because anyone can fabricate the price in paint or photoshop. I was furious. I will not be booking through a Flight Hub again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:33:45.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

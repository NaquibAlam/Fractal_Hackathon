It's quick, intuitive and the service is great. They send you the receipts for easy expensing and their customer service is quick and responsive. The issue is that the deliveries are often way before schedule. EzCater allows you to choose any time for delivery, but often the restaurant only has select pickup times leading to early deliveries. The last four times I've ordered the food has arrived 30-45 minutes before schedule was lukewarm by the time it was being consumed.\nMy advice is to set the delivery time for 30 minutes AFTER you need it so it'll arrive on time, and warm.\nShould be an easy fix for EzCater if they just notify you beforehand of the delivery time discrepancies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:24:43.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There was a sense of quality and very responsive customer service.\nNow you would be lucky to get a person on the phone. Even email inquiries are ignored.\nCustomers store their wealth in chosen vaults, all over the world. Europe, Asia, Canada. Customers do this for a reason. However, if someone wants to redeem their precious metals they are informed that the company only ships from the USA. I only learned this from reading reviews here on Trustpilot.\nWhen I signed up with Goldmoney, I read through everything they had available on their site and there was no mention of this in 2013.\nMy confidence in the company is enormously undermined.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:27:42.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I called and never returned my calls. 2 I was never told the shipping method would require me to miss at minimum of half days work causing me to loose at least 3 he's at 45.50 per hour as I work at vc summer nuclear construction site in jenkinsville sc.the shipping does not normally deliver to private residence. The wanted me to met at some location with a truck to pick my order up, that's not the service I paid handsomely for.I work at a nuclear construction site 5 days a week and if some ask me about the product I installed on my vehicle at this time I doubt I would recommend your company to any one,by the way over 4000 people work st this site daily and that is how I saw your product on a other vehicle. I feel that I should some how be compensated for some of this not so great service.as of today 3-6-2017 I am sitting at home waiting for the delivery. Needless to say I am not happy with this service and I have not even seen the product.

After transfered to Supersaver.se I am presented with a lot of options that makes it very hard to once again select the one I already had chosen. When I finally find it it is more expensive than what I had been presented earlier. Trying to finish the booking anyway (I don't want to search again) I am given a lot of options I have to deselect and it is even hard to deselect them. When I believe I have chosen just the travel the price is higher once again and I have to go back and deselect something I thought I had selected. This can only have one reason and that is to make me buy something I don't want. It is misleading and confusing. I will try hard to find other ways of buying my trips in the future and even pay more to do so. I still give you a 2 and that is because I expect to get the trip I have purchased which I haven't seen yet.\nArne", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T11:11:50.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Less than a year later the cushion I sit on is breaking down badly and a spring is squeaking loud enough that either it's broken or preparing to break. When I contacted the company by email they offered to fix it for me but I would have to pay their standard service fee as well as any parts needed. I understand it's not under warranty but, a chair that's less than a year old, shouldn't be breaking down the way it is. I have another rocker recliner (older) from Art Van that was given to me several years ago and is still holding up mechanically. When I compare the 2 chairs there's no competition. Art Van wins by a mile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:29:07.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

You're lucky we didn't got hurt because I would sue you.\nSEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE GAME\n- After I got back to Serbia, I wrote them an email with pictures of the receipt and tickets as proofs that mistake happened and that I want difference in what I payed for and what I got (total of €193.68) back.\nI got an answer from their support agent that I can only get 15% of that amount back.\nDISGRACE!\nMessage to the chat bot:\nYes, I understand how your system works. Yes, I know you connect sellers and buyers but you sent me WRONG and CHEAPER tickets. I payed for West Stand €300 4 months before the game, I got North East Stand of €90.

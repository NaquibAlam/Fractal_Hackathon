Upon opening one, the ink started spilling out from cartridge onto my office carpet. I immediately threw all 3 out.\nI called and told them what happened. They said I would be credited for amount and to write an e-mail stating what happened and ask for damage/incident report. Sent e-mail and have never heard back from them.\nThe interesting thing is that the last time I bought ink from inkfarm was about 10 years ago, and the cartridges ruined my printer. I figured after ten years the product would be improved, so I took a chance and ordered this time.

Their website pretends to appeal to all price levels when, in fact, only the highest prices are available. Whatever prices are initially put down, Zicasso tells you it will be much higher. Question: why bother putting costs down that are unavailable. In the end, you are much better off going to the travel agent of your choice or book directly. You will save lots of money.\nWhile the agents at Zicasso are friendly enough and respond relatively quickly, the general nature of the responses are about the costs you are willing to absorb for your trip. And, as noted, there does not seem to be any interest in getting quality accommodations at the best price possible; rather it appears to be about maximizing the travel costs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:52:06.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Worst customer service experience. All you get is months and months of puppets telling you \"we are really backed up, try back in a week\" On top of that..their claims specialist that you can only reach during their business hours..not good when you are overseas, are completely useless. This girl had to have just woke up at 11am her time and didn't know a single thing..and I mean she didn't know a single thing! This uselessness a goes on and on..it's been weeks and they haven't even acknowledged that they received my paperwork. Every week..\"we are really busy, try back next week\" \"it's not in my system, we are busy, maybe it will update next week\"...I should have learned my lesson when I submitted my first claim a year ago.

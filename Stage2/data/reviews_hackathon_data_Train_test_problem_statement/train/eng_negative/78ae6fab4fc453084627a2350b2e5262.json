Cars are priced at at least double the bluebook value with over 20 percent interest. If your car breaks down they will conveniently repair in shop, and add the repair bill to your loan at the same interest rate. My car had NO problems outside of routine maintenance until they started \"repairing\" my oxygen sensor and engine mounts. They said (the finance departmemt) when I totaled my car that they would consider the loan satisfied if I financed another car. Right before they sent me out in a second car that overheated under 120, miles I was informed that if I defaulted on the second loan, I'd be responsible for 2 car loans as my loan wasn't totally wiped out like the account rep promised. This time is the first time I heard the word forbearance come out of their mouths. A bunch of con and rip off artists is what Oak Motors is made of. If you must purchase a car that you don't know the price of until signing the final paper work , take a mechanic with you and take it to AutoZone during test drive to put on diagnostic machine.

The weather has really affected the trip. We were able to do the boat ride, but it was rainy, cold, and you couldn't see anything because of the fog. We learned that we shouldn't book excursions ahead of time as every trip we took was affected. The ferry to rangitoto island had little visibility and then when we got to the island, there was nothing to see and the tour was not good. A similar story for Waiheke island. Everyone kept saying how there weren't many people for the excursions because people don't choose to go when the weather is bad. It made us feel pretty bad.\nThen in Queenstown, they couldn't believe we wanted to go up the gondola ride because you couldn't see anything but that's when it was booked for and it was pre booked.\nAgain, weather is no ones fault but we will never again prebook so many weather dependent activities. I would recommend you inform future NZ travelers that those activities your company books are largely weather dependent and not enjoyable in rainy/ low cloud weather. And they should wait to book activities until they arrive.\nTransfers were fine. Hotel in Auckland was an awkward apartment. Hotel in Queenstown was nicer.\nAlso, the morning we went to check in for the ferry for Rangitoto island at the time on our sheet, we were informed it had been cancelled and moved by four hours. No one called or emailed to inform us of this. Pretty terrible service when we had arranged the day around this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:14:13.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

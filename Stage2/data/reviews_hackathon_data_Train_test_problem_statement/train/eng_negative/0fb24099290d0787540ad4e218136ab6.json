I purchased flowers and extra's totalling $180 EURO to send to a friend overseas for their birthday and I was completely disappointed. The bouquet delivered was nothing at all what was advertised on their website - complete false advertising at its best. I had requested a bouquet of fireball roses, which was supposed to be \"an amazing bouquet with roses in orange, red and yellow colours\". What was delivered was some strange looking arrangement with 4 roses, carnations and other green leaves which resembled nothing like the original picture. I mean I understand there could be some slight variation to what was displayed on the website, but it was completely wrong and I thought they had delivered the wrong bouquet.\nAfter contacting customer service and expressing my disappointment, their solution was to call my recipient and see if they wanted to swap the bouquets. I mean seriously the recipient has no idea what was originally ordered or it's worth so is this appropriate? I have never heard of such poor customer service. They would only deliver a new bouquet if they could take the other one back, which by now had been sitting in my friend's house for almost 2 days.\nThey will not refund my purchase or even part of it and so I am left writing this review. Please do not waste your money with this company and use an alternative service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:11:31.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

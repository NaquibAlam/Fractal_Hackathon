No one was helpful and the route suggested to us was an extra 2 hours out of the way. Apparently that was the only alternate route given to everyone else because each train departing on that route was packed full of masses of people which didn't feel safe at all and we missed the next two trains because of the overflow of people trying to squish themselves onto a tiny train. We spent 6 hours at the Liege train station trying to figure out how to get to our destination. No one was apologetic about this and we received no offer for any sort of refund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:15:50.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Ordered dress from the seller Elegantdresses/Order no: 332550208 and everything about the dress was wrong(material, size and craftsmanship). The dress was Inside Out! Opened a dispute, seller said they will make a new dress if I close it. Dhgate will never give you full refund unless you send the item back even though it was useless. It was gonna cost over $50 to ship it back which was ridiculous. I emailed dispute to close it believing that seller will keep to their word and also the person who handled the dispute said \"If you have any problem later, or seller do not cooperate and help you solve the problem, please do not hesitate to tell us. We will help you further. Please do not worry.\" They never made it and kept dragging on with lie after lie.\nI kept emailing the person who handled the dispute - no reply. Emailed customer service - no reply. Then I contacted the live support multiple times and spent hours. First person said \"ask seller leave a message saying \"I agree to give you a refund of $**\"\". How can this happen when the seller does not respond to you! Then every time after all the representatives kept saying hat they escalated the case and dhgate will email but that never happened. I chased this for over 6 months!\nThis seller was exploiting the system and committing serious misconduct and they literally took no action & showed a blind eye to this! DHGATE, CUSTOMER SERVICE & SELLERS ARE ALL LIARS AND ULTRA GREEDY SCAM ARTISTS. No matter what even if they send completely useless item they will make money because the return costs are so high. What a complete waste of time, money and energy. Learnt a valuable lesson not to trust anyone so easily.\nDon't be a victim, AVOID THIS HORRIBLE SITE LIKE A PLAGUE!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:19:42.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

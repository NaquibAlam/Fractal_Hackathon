The car was ok, my only criticism was the seats were a bit dirty, but no problem.\nWhen I retuned the car they said I had made the seats dirty and the cleaning bill was 150+35 euros which is taken from my credit card, (no proper VAT invoice provided either). I have additional excess insurance but that doesn't cove 'cleaning'.\nIt is a scam!\nThey take photos of the dirty seat and send it to you with a copy of the invoice, but when I complained and asked for the photo of the seats before I hired the car, they say thats not possible.\nJust as a note, I was travelling alone but Goldcar say I managed to get both front seats dirty.\nAmazing scam. I bet the next person who hires this car has the same scam done to them, then the next and the next.\nThis was my first business trip to Tenerife but I'll need to hire a car four times a year, every year up to 2022. Guess who I won't be using?\nAvoid this company at all costs.\nIn response to the reply below, if you can send me a photo of the dirty seats after I hired the car, then you also have photos of the seats from after the previous customer. Take a look at them and send me a copy. They will prove the seats were dirty before I collected it. I've already asked you to do this but \"it isn't your policy\". No, your policy is to rip people off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:51:45.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

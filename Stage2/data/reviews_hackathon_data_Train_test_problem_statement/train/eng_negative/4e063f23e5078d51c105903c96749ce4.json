Someone from the company kept trying to call me (over and over) but spoke little to no English and I could not understand what they were saying, or what they were asking for. After three calls I stopped answering. They had the number of the family member at the delivery end and could have just as easily called her. A day after delivery was due, I received an email from Avas asking me to call them. I called and was again speaking with someone with very broken/unclear English. We finally managed to get address changed to the funeral home itself but it was a struggle with lots of friction. At one point I even asked for someone who spoke clearer English and I was told there was no one available - that everyone was \"busy\".\nEven after giving the representative the correct funeral home address in Paducah, KY - the company attempted to deliver the flowers to a different town where there weren't even any funeral homes. The company finally, two days later, called the recipient of the flowers and she had them deliver to her home in Nashville, TN - a long way away from the funeral home in Paducah, KY. The flowers that were delivered were not the ones I ordered, they were much lower quality and did not include the cross pillow that I ordered as a religious symbol for the family. The cross was the most important part of the design I ordered.\nAfter writing emails with the company - explaining all of this - they refused to refund the order, or credit me with any kind of discount. This company has the worst customer service I have ever had to deal with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T16:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:10:41.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

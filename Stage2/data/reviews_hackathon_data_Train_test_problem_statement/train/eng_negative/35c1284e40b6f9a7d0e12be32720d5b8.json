I landed today (12th Feb 2017) Malaga, Spain they pick me up and take me to this con company (Delpaso) and they wanted either €100 for a full tank in a Fiat Panda which actually would cost only approx €40 or I pay €116 and I just bring the car back with a full tank and it includes insurance. So they entice you to take their insurance and and the full to full tanks. Despite the fact I paid online for my hire car in advance it became completely irrelevant as I said I above they wanted more money. I recommend you avoid this company at all costs As neither company will refund me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T14:32:46.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

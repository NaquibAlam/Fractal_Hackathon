Have raised complaint to Ups service but no response till today. Whole money 46.5 USD wasted. Extremely bad experience as It was my first wedding anniversary. I ordered from India for my husband who is in US but you just spoiled our precious moment like anything. Appologise for the rude comments but what else can I say. Dont ever do this again with any customer as it is not only about money. Gift sometimes means more than that and are related with the emotions of humans.

Terrible experience. Ordered my flowers 12 days ago and still no delivery. I've emailed numerous times and keep getting the response that it's the couriers fault. I had to inform my receiver that she was getting flowers (ruined the surprise!). I was told they would be delivered today and they never even contacted her. I actually thought this site was a scam! They took my money straight away and I've now requested a refund, no reply! Do not order off this site if you wish to surprise somebody or wish for the flowers to be delivered on time.

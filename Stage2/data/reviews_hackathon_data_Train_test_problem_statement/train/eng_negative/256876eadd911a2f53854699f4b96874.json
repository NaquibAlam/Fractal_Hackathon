To put in short form:\n1. We booked an 8-day holiday. We did note that the first “day” started at 5:30 pm Dec 24th but decided the 12 am departure on the last day, Jan 1st, would at least ensure we had a full final day at the resort.\n2. after waiting until less than 2 weeks from departure to receive the paperwork from the agent Airlineticketcentre - it was discovered that the checkout time at the all inclusive resort was noon!!!\n3. All of you count with me…..can anyone find the 8 days This was unacceptable to all us as we had paid for that 8 days\n4. I immediately called Airlineticketcentre and questioned this – indicating it was not reasonable and not acceptable for our party of 4 to be stranded for 15 hours without a room etc.\n5. Agent Francina from Airlineticketcentre repeatedly consoled me with the statement “the stated checkout time is only standard” “ the hotel knows you will not be leaving until midnight” I continued to lament that the ticket very clearly states a noon checkout but she became irritated and told me “do not worry”. Famous last words!!\n6. To ensure our last day was enjoyable we tried to confirm with the hotel that we would not be checking out at noon as stated on our ticker. The hotel insisted we leave our room – I refused so in the end and not until the final day - the hotel conceded in part but made us combine into 1 room. The hotel also informed us Sunwing had only PAID THEM till noon which meant, in fact, we no longer were eligible for food and drinks for the next 15 hours!!! AND,,,,Sunwing had more clients coming in that night for our room who had also paid for their Day-1 at the hotel though not arriving until after midnight.\n7. So, Airlineticketcentre and Sunwing has collected Day 8 for services from us while also collecting for Day 1 from another set of travelers for the same room!!!!\n8. In the final days at the resort leading up to our departure I had reached out to the booking agent Airlineticketcentre on 2 occasions asking that they live up to what they had told me and straighten this out with the hotel. Not surprising – the emails were ignored and in fact I have never had a response to them!!\n9. The Sunwing agent at the resort, Maria, was a horrible person to start and we witnessed many arguments with other clients. Here response – “we count that as a day”\nIf not for the hotel willingness to work with us and allow us to eat and drink at the resort we would have been left DESOLATE with all our luggage for 15 hours Airlineticketcentre and SUNWING DOUBLE DIPPED and left us holding the bag so to speak. Thankfully the hotel took pity on us – BUT only after much fighting, stress, and of course my refusal to leave the room.\nSunwing’s and Airlineticketcentre both have continued to argue that the information was on the ticket and therefore they can call any length of time 8 days as long as we agree to it!!!!. They state I should have called had I not agreed to the terms!! BUT, I DID CALL AND I DID STATE CLEARLY THAT WE DID NOT AGREE TO THE TICKET TERMS…..Sunwing’s response – you must have some misinformation!!! Airlineticketcentre's response – “we offered for YOU to pay for extra days” Are you kidding me Airlineticketcentre – I already paid for the vacation and would have canceled had Francina NOT LIED and would have been happy had Francina dealt with the hotel AS REQUESTED.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T19:27:56.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

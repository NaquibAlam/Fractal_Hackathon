For some reason it has dissapered from Trustpilot - I wonder why. I still haven't recieved my product or my money. Imagine having a shop selling nothing for high prices. This is quite a breilliant idea.\nIf trekkinn have lost my order id - here it is: Orderid 6669843\nI ordered a GPS 25. November 2016 - when it hadn’t arrived to me by early December I filed in a message on their website, that I hadn't received my product. After some correspondence and a second attempt I was told that it was lost in delivery, and the transporter would have to search for it. If they found it I would receive it.\nToday - 2 months after I havnt heard anything, so I decided to call their \"customer service\". I was told that they were still searching and if they found the product they would send it to me. If not I would get a refund. I told them that I was not interested in a refund but just to get the product - I did not order it for fun, I actually need it. The reply was: \"sorry we can’t do this - company policy\"\nIm not sure if I ever will see my money again - lucky for me it was just a small amount. But I am sure that I will never use this company again. You, who read this, shouldn’t either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T08:50:42.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I spent alot of money on the water softener and water purifier equipment. before installing the new system we ran all new PEX pipes throughout our house. So all the water lines are brand new we also drained our water heater. So far the hard water build up that we are having is worse then before we had the system. i even have Moen spot resistant fixtures and everyday the water spots keep getting worse. I wish I could return this system and just get a salt water softener since they seem to get rid of water spots.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:53:16.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

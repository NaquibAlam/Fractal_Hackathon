Our initial contact with the company was positive. The salesperson who took our order was knowledgeable, professional, and courteous. In addition, the original shipment of our order was extremely fast.\nUnfortunately, one of the logs arrived broken due to the poor packaging. I contacted the company and they quickly placed a replacement order. Awesome! Until a month passes and I never hear from anyone. So I call to get an update and am told I will be called back when they figure out what is going on.\nTwo weeks pass. So I call back. Complete confusion, like I had never originally called. So I re-tell the story. Second representative says they will get back to me with an update. At this point, I say: \"Are you sure, because I've heard that before\". They say yes.\nAnother week passes. So I call back. Same story. This time I ask for a manager to contact me immediately. A week later, a representative emails me to let me know that they don't know when the replacement log will be here, but they have sent an entire new log set. Wow! I think! That's pretty good at least even though it took forever.\nThen I receive the second log set and several pieces are broken due to poor packaging. THANKFULLY, the log we need is intact.\nThe next day, I receive the replacement log. It is broken. Not. even. kidding.\n1. Communication: I found it extremely frustrating to have to be the one continuously taking initiative to figure out where our replacement order was. I talked to at least two representatives on separate occasions with the promise that they would call or email me with an update with no further contact. When I expressed this concern to the next agent that I spoke with, there was never any obvious concern or explanation. I work in organizational development and this is unacceptable customer service. I only got sent to the manager at the very end.\n2. Shipping: Both log sets that we received were \"lightly\" wrapped in bubble wrap and a layer of cardboard. Having purchased extensive merchandise from Ikea, I will use them as a stellar example of proper packaging for shipment. Each item is wrapped in paper, then plastic, then high quality cardboard (shaped perfectly to fit the item and sealed), THEN placed into the box for shipment. When researching WD initially, I read many reviews giving this aspect (horrible experience for those patrons whose logs arrived damaged) poor ratings, but chose to disregard them because the customers who received their items in good condition outweighed the others. Now having been one of the \"others\" I can empathize more with their dissatisfaction. We find it completely unacceptable that all 3 packages that were shipped arrived with at least 1 broken piece. Any businessperson can tell you that's complete failure! In addition to the level of dissatisfaction from the customers, this cannot be a wise use of company resources.\nAfter this experience (spanning the length of two months in its entirety), I will never do business with this company again and advise you to do the same. I wish I had listened to my gut the first time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T01:47:02.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

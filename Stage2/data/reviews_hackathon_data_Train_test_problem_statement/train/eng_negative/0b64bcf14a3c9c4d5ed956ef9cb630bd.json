I booked a room Maui hawaii(Hololani rentals). Immediately upon booking I realized that there was no note of unit being equipped with air conditioner. I immediately I'm talking minutes after I booked I statmrtes chatting with Leah and expressed my concern to her. Leah could not find any information in the website about the unit being equipped with AC unit or not. She then suggested to get back to me the following business day. Which never happened. I had to call back myself. At this point they couldn't even find my booking or info. Took them several days. I also spoke to a Lauren over the phone at Vacatia and told me that she had forwarded my issue to the manager and that they would get back to me in an estimated time. They didn't so I called them. I was forwarded to a person named Dan. I requested a unit with AC due to medical issues with my kids. I explained that they needed to be in a controlled environment. He explained to me that none of the units in that building had Air conditioners. So I requested accommodations somewhere else. To justify my children's needs. He then proceeded to tell me that he couldn't make that decision at the time. He needed to speak to a supervisor and then would get back to me. He didn't so I called them again. I was forwarded to Lauren. Which in return told me that the supervisor is Dan. So Dan lied to me about whom he really was. I was very perplexed about why he would do such a thing. This was a serious matter. No one appreciates being miaelead this way. Lauren then transfers the call to Dan. He sounded annoyed and hesitant by my issue. Basically told me that it was my fault for booking without paying attention and proceeded to arrogantly lecture me about my decision and the responsibility I had to take. Months later I'm stuck with a bill for services that where never rendered to me or my family. Without any regards to me or my family. Vacatia rift along with his employees took advantage of me and practiced very poor business etiquette. Not once was Dan the supervisor was willing to make other arrangements with me. He had the power to make a difference and make our vacation possible and instead took our money and ran with it. Never to follow up with me. Simply took our money without remorse. It's very unfortunate that when you open up the link to website they do nothing but praise a pleasant family oriented stay at any of their destinations. But beware. There's a hidden agenda. When you the customer figure things out. It's a too late. For they VACATIA. Will do nothing for you except take your money without regard.\nLC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T08:42:04.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

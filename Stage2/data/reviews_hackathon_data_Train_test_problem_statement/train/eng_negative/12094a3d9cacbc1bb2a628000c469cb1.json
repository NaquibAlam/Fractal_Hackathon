I tested it a week before and found it to be defective, one of the motors wasn't working. I contacted Tomtop for a replacement/refund. They wanted me to send them a video of the product not working for their technical team to see. I then sent footage of the product not working. About 4 days later I received an email saying it had been passed on to their tech team and they would contact me with a solution. I' still waiting after 6 weeks. One of the motors on the quadcopter doesn't work. All I wanted was to send it back and have a replacement sent out.\nI WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THEM AGAIN AND WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO THE SAME.\nA TERRIBLE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE...STAY CLEAR OF TOMTOP!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T13:00:09.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

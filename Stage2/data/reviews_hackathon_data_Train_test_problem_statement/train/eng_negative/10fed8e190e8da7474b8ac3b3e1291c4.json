No knock or door bell to make sure someone was home to receive them. They could of been delivered hours before they were found. The safest part was if they had knocked there was someone there. I didn't spend $40 in delivery fees for them to be left on the porch to get bugs in them or turn bad in the weather. Really not happy with the service on that end. Too much money to spend for the recipitant not to be able to enjoy it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:54:34.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

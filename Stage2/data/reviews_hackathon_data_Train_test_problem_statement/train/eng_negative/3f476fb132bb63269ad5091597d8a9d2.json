What I thought was a USPS $6.95 shipping charge magically turned into a $14.95 charge on checkout which I didn't notice. When I called them to complain, they said the only way to ship to Hawaii was by Priority Mail. So guess what: my order came by USPS Parcel Post. After arguing with their customer service for 15 minutes my case was referred to a supervisor who ended up refunding my $8 overcharge.

My booking agent was very professional but then after moving in I encountered some issues with the condo. A stove burner that didn't work and was just barely connected to a broken connector which posed a fire hazard and some missing blinds on windows in the bedroom that did not have any other window covering for privacy or blocking of the street lights. I went to the Vacation Rental Pros office to report this and the reception person was not friendly at all as well as very apathetic to the problems I reported. She said she would call maintenance but didn't even ask which unit I was in. So I told her my unit so maybe she would actually call maintenance. 2 WEEKS later someone called me in the middle of the day to tell me they were coming to fix the stove burner now. I was not home so it was not a convenient time. I told them to give me some more notice. So a few days later they did not call but entered the condo without my knowledge. I called to complain and the Vacation Rental Pro office said they were sorry but would come fix the washer. I never said anything was wrong with the washer. The window blind repairman called when he was outside the condo. Again no notice and 2 weeks after reporting the problem. My last issue was that the Vacation Rental Pros company called me to see if I wanted to book again for the following year. I explained I was not vacationing but was temporarily displaced due to Hurricane Matthew. They said ok. Then I got another call about the same thing and again explained. Then the very next day I got another call to book again! Needless to day I would probably use other rental companies in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:54:43.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

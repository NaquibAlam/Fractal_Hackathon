After it arrived we decided it was satisfactory and I would have my wedding party and fathers order suits from here in the same color. They attempted to order but the color was no longer listed on the site. There had been no indication it would be a limited or short run fabric. Contacted customer service, was told to repeatedly check the site over the next month to see when it is available again or select another color. Repeatedly ignored questions asked multiple times about availability, order guarantees, or help with reaching a mutually beneficial solution. Refused to escalate or put me in touch with a customer service or sales manager. Would love to have my party order 11-12 suits from here if something can be resolved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:17:38.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

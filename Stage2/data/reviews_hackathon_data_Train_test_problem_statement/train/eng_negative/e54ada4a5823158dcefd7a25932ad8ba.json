I take time to review properties infrequently and rarely contribute a negative review. I suppose I've become accustomed to problems and glitches that contribute to a less than perfect stay and tend to be understanding. As a result, my few reviews almost always acknowledge exceptional service or a very positive experience. However, in this case, I honestly feel the public would be at risk if I don't share - I've never had a worse experience with a property and it's management than this. I won't elaborate on the minor issues and instead document the most egregious. When toilets were flushed in the upstairs bathroom - raw sewage percolated up and into the downstairs tub. Imagine human excrement in the tub you as you were about to use (or previously had used without knowledge this had occurred). I personally called customer service 9 times; many more calls from my friends and family, submitted a Maintenance request via the \"Vacation Rental Pros\" property management app and never received any response! On one of the later calls, I learned the customer service person I was speaking with was in the Philippines! Of course every time I called, I spoke with someone different and had to explain the issue over and over ad nauseam; and always receiving promises of call backs and service to repair - neither of which ever occurred. We abandoned the downstairs completely and crammed all our guests in the upstairs for the duration of this short stay. I would advise everyone to avoid this property management company. Although I thought I was reserving this property with VRBO, i actually paid \"Vacation Rental Pros\". I don't know who is primarily responsible for managing problems with the property, but I will never knowingly do business with \"Vacation Rental Pros\". I've filed a dispute with my credit card company - perhaps they can reach someone at Vacation Rental Pros that care. I hoping if they don't get paid, I may actually hear from someone!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:54:40.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Contacted last minute to request the change to both my flights with BA and monarch. I had called the airlines separately to be told yes it could be done but I had to go through last minute. 7 days later I am still waiting absolutely nothing at all to say if it can be done or how much it will cost. I also called several times on one occasion to try to sort the car hire to be told that I had to call an international number in lanzarote to change the name at 6 Euros a minute and would have to put my credit card details in. I said I couldn't call this number on my mobile and I no longer have a landline to be told by very rude customer service representative that that was my problem ! Despite that fact I had called 2 days earlier to be told that they could change the name from their end !\nTerrible service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T10:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T16:05:15.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

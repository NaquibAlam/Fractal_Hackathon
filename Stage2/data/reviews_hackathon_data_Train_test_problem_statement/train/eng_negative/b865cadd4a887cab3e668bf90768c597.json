Unfortunately, I was automatically signed up for a subscription with no confirmation or verification email. It wasn't until 2 days ago that I saw a charge on my credit card for $59 and looked into it further. The box is going to be delivered on Friday to an address where no one lives. I immediately contacted customer service explaining the situation and asking if there was a way to stop the delivery and if I could get a refund. Just today I heard back. They apparently have a 'strict billing policy' and cannot offer a full or partial refund or any sort of credit to compensate me for the mistake. They offered no solution or even acknowledged the problem that a box of food will be rotting at a home where no one lives. I have chosen Blue Apron, a service that offers very clear and helpful notifications on shipments and account changes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:44:46.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

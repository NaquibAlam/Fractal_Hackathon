First I waited the allotted time 15 days and checked. Oh, it was received, processed, and shipped. Still nothing. Yes, i understand that ALL your products come from other places and shipping ( so don't bother responding with the crap). You sent me a response that says YOU have until Mar 25. 2017. Well, today is the 20th.I checked again, nope nothing moving. First off, Why don't you tell people that the product is coming from China and that they apparently take the first 2 mo. off and completely shut down.? No mail, no shipping., no workers to get the orders, because they close for New Years. What I could have sewn them by now.Now I understand why you have so many complaints. So if my products aren't here by, on the 25th of this month, give me back my money. But then again I'm probably going to have to hire a lawyer to get that back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:50:06.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My existing Muji luggage case made smaller noise and Muji only cost me one-third of the price tag;\n2. no side handle, so if I put it on top cabin of trains, I have to turn it 90 degrees before I can get to the handle;\n3. battery pack place is a joke. I know that you may have to consider air safety control and hence made it a power bank, but the way to open and use it simply does not match what was described in the Kickstarter campaign;\n4. the worst part: it does not stand up straight, and instead it got a 10-degree of inclination, and it means if I put something a little large on top, like a laptop backpack, then it will simply fall over as a whole.\nSorry for this bad review but I simply have no reason to be happy at all, now I have to buy another luggage case so as to replace it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:08:35.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

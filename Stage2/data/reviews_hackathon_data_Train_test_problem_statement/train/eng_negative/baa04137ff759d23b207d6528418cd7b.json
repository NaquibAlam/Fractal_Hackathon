I'll leave the original below the update just to make sure you know what I was updating.\nSo, I finally got a response (of sorts) from this lot. Apparently if I have an issue with any equipment I have to log into my account (? Didn't know I had one but anyway) and click returns and follow the instructions to send it back. They don't do exchanges (and apparently don't answer questions) and you then have to order anew.\nReally? That's the response? Oh, and by the way don't bother trying to enter into an email exchange because that's from a NoReply email address.\nNow that's all good and fine but I have a few issues with that. Firstly, how do I know that if I send something back it won't end up stuck in Madrid because they refuse to accept it (yes, that really happened to some poor sod who is now out the money he paid for a wetsuit, the money he paid to send it back to them, and the wetsuit!).\nThen secondly, if I order again they will just send the same frigging thing - which is wrong on the bloody website!\nAll I need is one question answered: do you people have the short blade Jetfins as depicted in all the pictures on the website, or not? That's it. Nothing more. If you have it, can I have a pair? please? I'll even keep the long blades and flog them on eBay or something. Just for the love of Pete, answer your bloody emails like a grown-up.\nLast time I order anything from this lot.\nIf you're interested in the whole long story then please read below.\nI searched long and hard for a set of Scubapro Jetfins with the short blade and I was delighted to find a set on this website that ticked all the boxes. Short blades, good price - less than Â£100! and they even come with spring straps already installed. I couldn't get the money out fast enough. I ordered and awaited their arrival with bated breath.\nThe first inkling that something was amiss should have been that the tracking email they sent had no tracking information or receipt. The provided links just went nowhere. I responded politely to Maria and requested updated tracking information. Stony silence was the only reply.\nThe fins arrived in good time, only about 3 days after I ordered so I was really pleased with that. Opened the box and inside was a pair of brand new Scubapro Jetfins with the spring straps. I should be ecstatic with my purchase, right?\nUnfortunately I'm not. Very disappointed that I have apparently bought myself a second pair of Scubapro LONG blade Jetfins. I already have a pair and as great as they are, I don't want another pair. My current pair should last until my grandkids are dead and gone so another pair of the same is just a waste of money.\nReluctantly I return the new Jetfins to their box and compose Maria another email to the effect that I would like what I ordered i.e. a set of SHORT blade Jetfins as depicted in all the pictures on their website, or failing that a refund so I can continue my search.\nResponse from them so far? Nothing, nada, zip, bupkiss.\nI don't mind the slight cockup with the fins. If they made an error in packing I would gladly pay for the return of these and even delivery of the correct fins. I suspect though that they don't have the short blades and will just continue to ignore me until I get tired of the whole thing and go away. I left a one star review on their website, that they will post after moderating....like that's ever going to see the light of day. One would hope that after seeing that a customer is going to post a very negative review, one that they can easily fix, they would at least get in touch, but no.\nEasy fix here DiveInn. Just communicate and tell me you don't have what I ordered, refund my money and put the right picture on the website. At the moment it is misleading to say the least. If I was looking for the long blades I would no doubt have been delighted with my purchase and been singing your praises far and wide. As it is I am getting more and more annoyed and am now going to be telling everyone I can to steer clear of your shop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T19:07:39.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

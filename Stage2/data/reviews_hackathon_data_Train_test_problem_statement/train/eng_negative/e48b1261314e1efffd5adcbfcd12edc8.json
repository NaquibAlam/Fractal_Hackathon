They had ATE kits labeled Front, Rear, Rear Left, & Rear Right. The Rear kit from ATE was more expensive by a few dollars than the ATE kits labeled Rear Right or Rear Left. That seems to naturally imply that the Rear Left or Right kit included parts for one corner, and that the ATE kit labeled just Rear included parts for both corners in the rear. I know better than to make assumptions though, even fairly obvious ones. I contacted customer service to make sure that the kit I wanted to order would include parts for both sides. I received a reply saying that it did, and I placed my order. The kit arrived...and only parts for 1 side were in the box. Son of a...okay...I'll call customer service, and surely they will take care of this problem. The customer service rep I spoke to didn't listen to a word I said. He asked me this whole long line of seemingly irrelevant questions until finally it became clear that he hadn't bothered to listen to what the problem was. When I explained again the problem he told me that he couldn't help me, but he would have a supervisor call me back in about an hour. No call ever came. I submitted an online request, and the next day I received a reply. I ended up having to go write to them; wait for a reply; and repeat a total of 4 times. The end result of all of this was being treated like an idiot; lied to; told that the CS reply telling me that the kits covered both side was meaningless; I wasn't offered a single method to resolve the problem, not even just a return; I was treated like a liar & a thief for \"threatening\" to have to go through the chargeback process with my credit card company if they wouldn't do anything... It was incredible, horrible, absurd, insulting, baffling, pathetic, and it was the last time I will deal with Parts Geek. If they had any decency or common sense they would have changed the way they list the products on their website if they indeed intend it to be a kit for a single side, and they would have shipped me off a kit to cover the other side as their CS rep had indicated I would receive to begin with. We're talking about 8 small rubber rings that probably cost them $5-10 at most, and for the cost of those rings they could have purchased a loyal customer instead of creating a really upset customer. Not to mention the fact that it was just the right thing to do. I mean seriously? Their listings were explained horribly if they intended it to be a for a single side, and their own CS rep told it was for both sides. If that rep was wrong, then fine; but that isn't my fault or problem. I was offered a product for a price, and I accepted the deal. I received a product that is not the one I agreed to purchase. That is the definition of \"chargeback- merchandise not as described\", but yet I was \"threatening\" them when I asked them to find a solution to this problem.\nThe reply from Parts Geek is a flat out lie, and I'm not going to let a flat out lie stand without a response. It amazes me though that they would go to such lengths to provide such horrible customer service instead of just owning up to their mistake, and fixing it. I am an experienced mechanic, not some novice without any sense of right or wrong trying to just steal a part from them or cover up a mistake. That is exactly how they tried to make me feel though in their correspondence, and that I appreciated less than anything else. All it required was for them to actually spend 30 seconds reading their own CSR's response. I originally inquired about the centric kit, so that much is true at least. What the reply from Parts Geek does not bother to mention is that the message Parts Geek sent me about the Centric brand kit did not just answer my question about the Centric kit. The customer service rep provided a response about the entire category of parts as a whole regardless of brand. Later I discovered that the kit I was initially intending on ordering would not work for my car. The Centric brand seals are apparently about .5 mm too small in diameter, and they don't sit properly. As a result, I ordered a kit from a different manufacturer ATE. I made this order based on the information provided in the response to my initial inquiry. Please get this through your head Parts Geek. I inquired about Centric, but the CSR provided an answer about all of the brands for caliper repair kits. As a result, I saw no need to send an additional inquiry to receive information that I had already been given. Add to that the way the listings are provided, and I beg for you to please tell me how someone should not expect that parts kit to include pieces for both sides? You still haven't fixed that yet by the way. I checked. Rear Left & Rear Right have the same part number and price. Rear has a different part number & is more expensive. Don't you think that alone kind of implies that you can either purchase them separately or together as a kit for both sides? This is not a conversation that I had any desire to continue, but if you're going to post lies about me... I'll be glad to respond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T19:03:02.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

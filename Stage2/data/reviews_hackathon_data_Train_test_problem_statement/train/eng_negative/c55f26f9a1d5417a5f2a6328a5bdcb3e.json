When it wasn't delivered on the 13th after 2:00 PM like their florist \"confirmed\" they would, I sent them an email to which they never replied to. On the 15th, around noon Japan time, the arrangement hadn't been delivered yet, so I sent them an email requesting a refund to which, of course, they never replied to either. Later that after noon - Japan time, they delivered the arrangement...\nAlso, the card I added to the order was not a real Valentine's card, it looked more like half of a cardstock sheet where they printed the message and a bunch of flowers around it... not worth the price I paid for it.\nI sent them a third and final email letting them know that I was dissatisfied with the poor customer service they provided me with. Like I told them in it, I understand that delays may happen, especially when orders are placed for busy dates such as Valentine's day; I too understand that sometimes things may be out of their control since they also deal with 3rd party providers to service their customers, but not replying to my first two emails addressing my inquiries/requests is VERY unprofessional and what really bothered me. They may say \"it's a busy season because we receive a lot of orders for Valentine's\", but that seriously doesn't cut it. If you really want to provide an excellent experience, work overtime, hire temp workers... do whatever you need to do to keep your customer happy and have the COURTESY to reply to their emails with their inquiries because, after all, you're not providing a service for free.\nI was going to start filing a refund through PayPal if I didn't hear from them but the items were delivered albeit late, so I won't do it. That said, and like I told them in my last email, this was the first and last time I do business with them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T18:03:06.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

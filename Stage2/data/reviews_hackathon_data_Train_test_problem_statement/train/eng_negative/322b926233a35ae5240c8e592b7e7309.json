I spent nearly $1300 on tickets to a concert that I didn't end up seeing because I didn't receive the tickets. I don't appreciate money being taken out of my account 4 months before the event with only a confirmation email to show for it. I also don't appreciate being sent a generic email merely citing the company line when I request a refund. This is not an acceptable response to someone who has just lost such a large sum of money.

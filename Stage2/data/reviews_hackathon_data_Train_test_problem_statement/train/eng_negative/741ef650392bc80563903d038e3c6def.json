Have been sending them a whole heap traffic and sales. Earnt commission in the process and to date have been paid zero cents!\nDespite their interface showing the exact amount I am owed, they refuse to pay. They just keep giving me bull excuses, such as you haven't met the minimum payment threshold (which is a lie as I had to show them a screenshot of their own interface proving otherwise). Once they seen this, it then turned to \"our IT team are looking at it\", then \"our finance team are looking into it\" to \"we are currently investigating\", etc etc etc.\nAfter repeatedly asking to stop lying and transfer the payment into my account, I get:\n- please allow 3 business days for someone to contact you on the issue\nthen\n- please allow 1-2 business days\nthen\n- please allow another 3 business days for finance to get back to you\netc etc\nIt never ends and they are just taking me for a ride.\nYou know you aren't been taken seriously when your replies come in the middle of the night, all from a different user agent (clearly outsourcing customer service overseas).\nI have gotten replies from Irene, Tania, Taryn, Juanita, Sarah, Lorraine & Emily. Sometimes the same person re-joins the email thread that has been going on for over a month.\nI'm sick of emailing and getting taken for a ride, so now looking to take legal action.\nAnyway Catherine, I know you are going to ask for this, so here is my reference number: #2ZZ45M7\nSeems you are quite busy and used to replying to complaints. I actually did say many times in the email chain I would refrain from writing a bad review here, but they just kept saying sorry for the inconvenience, please wait x amount of business days and someone will get back to you.\nI wish I read this thread earlier.\nA message to others out there, be warned! Stay away, they are dodgy! And you will NOT get paid by them", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:50:57.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

That's what I thought I ordered -- I went back and looked at the web page for the product, and it clearly showed the image of a clamp-on derailleur. The dropdown menu for the product didn't indicate it was braze-on (if you check on other websites, they typically do). I'm in the U.S., and it would probably cost me $10 or so to return it -- not worth it. A disappointing experience, so I would just warn people to be very careful, as their labeling is sloppy. NOTE: I originally had a two-star review, but changed it to one-star after reaching out to their customer service, which basically ignored me. They didn't respond to my comments at all, and just sent me to a web page showing me the product had been delivered. So if you have a dispute with them, don't expect much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T07:14:29.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

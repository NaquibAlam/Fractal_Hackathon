Every time I have to use them for anything - even basic things like the annual service - something always goes wrong. When you phone up, people will say they'll phone you back - they never do, they'll tell you they'll do X,Y & Z to put things right but don't action their promises. Engineers don't turn up when they're suppose to, they say they'll phone before they come but don't or they get the address wrong & go to a different property. I've had engineers tell me my boiler is on it's last legs & that the replacement parts are no longer available & offered to arrange a Quote: for a new one, only to find out from an independent engineer that my boiler is fine (old but still ok & the parts are still available). I can't list all the issues & problems I've had with British Gas, as soon as there is an alternative company offering a comparable service product I'll leave British Gas & throw a party!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:10:18.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

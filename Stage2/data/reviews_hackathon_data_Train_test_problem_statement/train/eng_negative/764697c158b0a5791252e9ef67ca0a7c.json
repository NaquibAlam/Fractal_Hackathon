What's worse is that I have politely written to ask for a refund to no avail (how can you not afford to pay back unhappy customers????) Instead, I am given a \"complimentary refresh\" to give my posting better traffic at a higher position. No! This is not what I want at all! I am sick of wasting my time on unqualified candidates.\nTo all employers looking to hire: we posted the exact same listing on Indeed.com and received not only 3 times as many candidates as we did on Monster but more than 50% of them were qualified (compared to the 0 hit rate we had at Monster).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T21:49:19.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

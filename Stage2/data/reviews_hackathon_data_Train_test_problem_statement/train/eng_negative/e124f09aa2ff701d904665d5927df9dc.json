I gave the lady the size. You sent me a lid way too big! I called when I received it. I was told I was not charged for the lid, but it was shipped to me. I told the lady that was wrong I did order the lid. She said she would change it and I should wait for my credit card bill and then call back. I got the credit card bill and I called this morning. The lady I spoke to said she could not help me and I should call 781 570-5601 ext 704. I called, I got a lady whose accent is so terrible I could not understand her. She had to spell out everything for me. She was not very smart either. I told what size I ordered and she could not get it straight. She said I should send a picture of it to you comopany. All I wanted was a return label. I told I did not have a camera. Oh you have to send a picture! Well di I have to hire someone to come to my house and take a picture and then send it to you. I am a senior, this is not easy.\nSo if I send a picture how will this help you. It is still too big. I an send a picture and show the lid and then show the dish and you can see it is too big fot the dish Hiring someone to come here and take the picture will cost more than three lids\nIf I do not get any satisfaction from you I will dispute the charge with the credit card company.\nThe ady at extension 704 english accent was so bad I could not understand her trying to give me your e-mail address. It took ten minutes just to figure her out.\nYou have terrible customer service\nGeri Jacobson", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T22:27:05.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I ordered them on 1/14 and my healthcare HSA Visa card had quickly been charged for them. A few days later I received an email stating that my transaction was 'high risk' and that i would need to provide pictures of my ID and the payment card i used. I complied, and even contacted phone support to provide my address for confirmation. I was then informed that my order was confirmed and I could expect my glasses to be processed and shipped as soon as they were done.\nA few days later, I contacted chat support to check on my order status. Per the chat line i was informed that my order had been reflagged by the payment provider. Now, Please understand the HSA Visa card I used had already been charged and the payment posted, so it was apparent that the transaction had already gone through. After repeated attempts to get the chat agent to understand that I had already confirmed my order previously over the phone, she apologized and stated that they could take PayPal and reprocess my payment. Unfortunately, HSA cards don't use PayPal, and I was hesitant to provide even more private information to a company I knew nothing about, so I declined.\nI called the toll free number on the SmartBuyGlasses.com website immediately after my confrontation with the chat agent. I was told on the phone that my order was being made and that it would be shipped out on Thursday 1/24. Feeling reassured, I assumed the matter was resolved and my glasses would be arriving shortly.\nEarly this morning, I received another email from the company stating that my order had indeed been reflagged and that I would need to pay via PayPal. At this point I am at the end of my rope with this company, and will be pursuing a payment dispute with my HSA card provider if I do not get a proper resolution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:10:41.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

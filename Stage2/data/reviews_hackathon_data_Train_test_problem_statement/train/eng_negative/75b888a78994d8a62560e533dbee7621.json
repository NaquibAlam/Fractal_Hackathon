Even though our first week's box of food was supposed to be free to us because it was a gift from my daughter, Hello Fresh charged us the full amount anyway and then did not respond to any of my emails to them asking the charge to be corrected. My receipt for my first order showed the charge as $0.00, but they charged my bank account the full $59.94. Delivery times have been from midday on the day of promised delivery to the the day after the promised delivery day. We probably are going to be canceling our account with them. Too bad, because the food and recipes are good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:38:40.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

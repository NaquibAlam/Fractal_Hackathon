Nowhere during the online booking was I informed that the offer only applied to people residing outside Denmark, neither did the rental documents state such either.\nI couldn’t get a refund at the desk but was encouraged to contact Cartrawler, which informed me that they had 20 working days to reply.\nA couple of days later I receive a mail where Cartrawler state that I have informed them that I am a citizen of Luxembourg, and because of that are not entitled to a refund.\nI replied that nowhere during the booking process did I state that I was a citizen of Luxembourg, and that in case I was, why did they send me a rental agreement in Danish language?\nSome days later I receive a new mail that it was their system that anticipated that I was from Luxembourg, hence I connected via a server in Luxembourg, but they could not be held responsible for such thing, I should have informed them that I was NOT a citizen of Luxembourg. But as a goodwill gesture they would refund me 45% of the total amount I have paid.\nI kindly decline that offer, in writing, and they reply that they will need to look further into the case.\nThe day after they refund me the 45% and I never hear from them again.\nDespite I’ve tried to call Cartrawler several times, but from Congo via satellite and cannot hang waiting for a long time, I am still waiting for their reply.\nFor that reason, I cannot recommend Cartrawler, neither give them more than 1 star, which they do not even deserve, nevertheless, one lees company to consider for my next rental.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:23:42.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

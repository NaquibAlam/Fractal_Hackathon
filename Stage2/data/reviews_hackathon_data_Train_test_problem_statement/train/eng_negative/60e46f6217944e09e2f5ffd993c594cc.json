I like ebates 100x better. It is so easy to get your money back and their customer service is amazing with missing cash back! It takes so long to get money available from transactions you forget you even did them and then I realized my cash back was randomly declined or just disappeared. Too much of a hassle when there are other better cash back sites!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:30:16.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

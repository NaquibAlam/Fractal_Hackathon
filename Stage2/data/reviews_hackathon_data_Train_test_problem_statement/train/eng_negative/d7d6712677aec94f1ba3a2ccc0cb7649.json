You would book a pickup, a friendly helpful driver would arrive, and your package would arrive at its destination when UPS said it would.\nHowever, recently they have gone down the pan. Here are two examples of their so-called premium \"express\" option I have experienced recently.\n(1) Australian saga\nI ship a package to Australia. The package gets from Europe to Australia in 2 days ... so far so good.\nThen it gets stuck in Botany for 3 DAYS UPS said \"mechanical breakdown\".\nNow, for you who don't know Australia, Botany a suburb next to Sydney Airport, and my package was destined for Sydney, 18 minutes drive away.\nHOW ON EARTH CAN IT TAKE 3 DAYS FOR A PACKAGE TO TRAVEL 18 MINUTES ?\n(2) Trans-Europe saga\nOk, now I send a premium \"UPS Envelope\" by their premium \"UPS Express\" pre 10.30 to another European country.\nI receive a notification that there has been a \"transportation accident\". Fine, ok, accidents happen. But that was at 1am, and at the time of posting this post, it is now 6pm and the UPS tracking is still saying \"transportation accident\" ??? Seriously ???", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T20:14:53.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They sent 1 empty case worth 99p in a tiny cardboard envelope via courier and then tried to state all items had been delivered. Con artists. It was impossible for more than 1 item to fit in the envelope and now they are blaming courier. Joke. Out of pocket and having to fight via paypal which I doubt will be any use as they want evidence and they provided tracking for the 1 item and claim all were in same parcel. Avoid at all costs! I used them in past and seemed fine. Never again.

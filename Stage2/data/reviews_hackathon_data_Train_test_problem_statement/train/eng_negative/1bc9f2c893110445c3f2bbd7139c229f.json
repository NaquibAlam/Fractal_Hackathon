We opened a joint account, all went well for my wife since she's french. From end of december last year until now, no bank card received. It's been more than a month. First they said deposit 10,000€. Then ask for the card online. Link never worked, called the customer service line for the dozens of time, each time took +15minutes of waiting with the elvis song in the background. Have to print another form and sign it physically, scan and email back. Promised us to send my card in 7 business days. Up to this day..nothing.. I deeply regret opening account here. Very unprofessional!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:38:05.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

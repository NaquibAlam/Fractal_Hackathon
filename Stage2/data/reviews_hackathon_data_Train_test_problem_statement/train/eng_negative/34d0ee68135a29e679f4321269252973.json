The FPV goggles still haven't arrived due to being on \"back order\" despite receiving no indication of them being out of stock at the time of purchase, and receiving an email on the 26th of December saying they were expected to be back in stock on 6th of January. The battery charger I received for the drone batteries stopped working after seven charges. After contacting customer support and sending on a video of the problem, they proceeded to offer me €5 to replace the AC adapter for the charger. This product cost me €12.45 so I have no idea where they are getting the €5 figure from. After declining this offer customer support hasn't replied this was nine days ago. I've also had other issues with their support such as when they contacted me asking was the delay with the FPV goggles okay, I replied asking what was the alternative expecting maybe an alternative product or offer of refund. Banggood simply replied with \"We will arrange shipment once the item restocks.\". They have been simply terrible and unless rectified I'd never order from them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T12:43:02.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

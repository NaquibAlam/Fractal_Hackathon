At least once a month we have internet outages. The last experience was be beyond frustrated. 2 weeks ago we lost internet. I waited for it to come back, like I always do, but after a week it still wasn't resolved so I called frontier. Person on the phone told me it was my modem that went bad after a system upgrade. I was already irritated when she said that my new modem would arrive 2-4 days. (How does a business in today's world not have overnight options???) well here we are today, day 4 of waiting for new modem. I called them to find out where this is and they told me that no one made a ticket for this. My modem had not been ordered. I work from home. My cell phone booster runs off internet. 2 weeks without internet is TOTALLY unacceptable. Even after talking with a \"supervisor\" they now tell me that the best they can do is send a tech out to my house on Friday. It is currently only Tuesday Not only have I lost out on work time because I have had no internet at home for this long....not they want me to stay home all day INCASE a tech has to come to my house!!! Also this \"supervisor\" said that he is sure that the problem isn't my modem at all but a line issue. What else can I do so that more people don't have to deal with this and lose out on time and money with this company!!! Do NOT pay for this if you have other internet provider options!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:58:15.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

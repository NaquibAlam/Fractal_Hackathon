I waited over 6 weeks for the watch to be dispatched. I called several times in between for an update on my order and they kept saying give it 1-2 more weeks. After 7+ weeks of waiting, i get an automated email saying my order has been cancelled due to unavailability! Really? It took you 7 weeks to tell me that the product was not available??? In exchange they gave me a coupon code for 50 off a purchase of $1000... $50 of a $1000 for 6 weeks of waiting, seriously??? It's like here you go, a slap in the face.\nPS I even emailed them with my concerns prior to this post but they have not replied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:59:29.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

One of the parcels was send by DPD Netherlands towards Belgium.\nDelivery date on the 17th of januari was not possible because their driver was too busy. So I called the helpdesk and agreed that delivery will take place on friday the 20th January. Because that was the only day someone was home.\nOn Thursday the 19th, there was a note in the mailbox that they tried deliver it but nobody was home. OFCOURSE THAT IS WHY I AGREED WITH DPD it had to be delivered on FRIDAY the 20th and not thursday de 19th.\nThey also requested it we would pick it up ourselves now.\nWe do not have a car that is why we order online.\nSo my girlfriend to the DPD parcel shop to pick it up by bike. She could not carry the box by bike so had to unpack the items and put it in a bag. She was not allowed to even leave the empty box over there! Totally no service at all.\nThey where also unfriendly at the parcel shop.\nI advice NOT TO use services of DPD anymore. Use DHL or Post.nl instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T18:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:07:05.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

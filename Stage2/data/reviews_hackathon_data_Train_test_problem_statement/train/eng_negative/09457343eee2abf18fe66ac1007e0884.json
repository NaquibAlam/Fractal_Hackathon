So I immediately call FlightHub to have my last name added. But I was told that I had to pay $75.00 to have my name change. I told the lady that I just literally purchased my ticket and it was a honest mistake. So my husband got on the phone and tried to explain what happened but the lady still insisted that I pay $75.00. So my husband asked to speak to a manager. He was on hold for a long time on the phone. So he hung up and called back. It took about six minutes for someone to talk to my husband. My husband still got the same answer. I think it is a outrageous for Flighthub to charge an extra fee to modify my name. It is not like I waited a day or two to call to add my last name. But I literally called as soon as I noticed that I didn't put my last name. Flighthub should go out of business for being GREEDY.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T09:43:19.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

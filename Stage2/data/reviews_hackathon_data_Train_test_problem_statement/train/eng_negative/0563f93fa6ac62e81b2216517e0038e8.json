We were able to come up with Spark Energy. However, the processing didn't go through, and I was never informed. I called back to follow up and the second woman told me about the first application. She recommended another provider, and when I asked if she has a referwnce, she told me \"Do you not trust me? This is recorded. I am not going to lie to you.\" I don't know why she got offended. She was telling me everything over the phone, and I just want you see it too. I'm not gonna remember all the figures over the phone for different rates per kwh consumption. Good thing I controlled my temper. I know I could just hang up, but I'm not really that kind of person. We were still able to find one - Just Energy. Hopefully.

We thought this was expensive for car hire however decided it was worth it for a ‘luxury’ car\n1st August Jeep Wrangler collected from K10 Rent A Car Ibiza at the airport but damage to car was not noted on the vehicle inspection report (see attachment). They told us this was because they had forgotten to insert a carbon copy which we knew not to be correct as the rest of the information had copied over clearly. As a precaution we took our own photos.They asked for the credit card used for our booking and debited 1500 euros. They did not make it clear that this would be charged immediately. We also noted that there was no sign of a manual or registration documents in the car which is a legal requirement in Spain.\n3rd - 6th August - We used the car to drive to a beach on each of these 4 days and to a local restaurant on 3 evenings. The island is only 24 miles long and we estimated that we had probably covered about 100 miles at the most. The fuel tank was just over a quarter full when we picked it up and we paid another 60 euros for petrol. We were aware of the high insurance excess plus we have 2 small children and the car was driven with great care. However, the clutch pedal always seemed stiff and after we turned the engine off there was a burning smell. Initially we assumed that was possibly normal for a Jeep.\n7th August - As a precaution we thought it best to call the car hire company to mention the burning smell. They told us to call their mechanic and ask him to come to our hotel. We did this through the Spanish speaking receptionist at the hotel and were surprised that K10 asked us to arrange for the mechanic to look at the car.\n8th August - The mechanic took the car from our hotel at 9am and asked us to call for an update at 11am. We did this and were surprised to be told that the car would not be delivered back to the hotel but we had to go to Ibiza Town at 8pm to collect the car. We asked if K10 rent a car would cover the cost of the taxi and were told we had to pay for a taxi as it was our fault that the car was damaged. Our hotel made several attempts to call the K10 office at the airport and the office in Ibiza Town to ask for more details. K10 were very rude and hung up on two occasions continuously saying that the clutch had broken and we had caused the damage. We took a taxi to the office in Ibiza town, where they notified us that the car would be handed over once we signed a document. We did not understand the language nor the figures Quote: d on the document so refused to sign. We were advised to go to another K10 office in Ibiza Town but we were not allow to hold onto the document until we signed. We would have welcomed the opportunity to discuss the document with someone who could translate it. On arrival at the other office we were faced with the same accusations that we had broken the clutch. When asked about the history of the car we were told that it was 2 years old which we questioned as there was over 50,000 km of mileage recorded meaning about 500 kms per week. This would be difficult on such a small island. I asked about the service history but they refused to discuss it. Again they printed the same document in Spanish and demanded a signature for us to accept liability for the damage. We asked to see the garage’s invoice or at least the mechanics report as we wished to understand how we could have broken the clutch, having driven the car a very few miles compared to the mileage completed by previous drivers. This was not available but they would email it the next day once we signed the report.The man in the office would not let us read the document and when we asked for a translation he said it was exactly the same as our original contract. I have attached the original contract and the unsigned document and clearly they are not the same. My wife tried to take a photo of the document and they physically restrained her to prevent her taking pictures. When we asked about the total bill as the figures that we could see were confusing he said it came to 1594.93 euros. After much arguing my wife spotted a copy of the document on the printer so she picked it up and very quickly left the office (see attached). The total bill for the supposed damage is over 3000 euros. We were reluctant to contact the company again as they seemed comfortable to resort to violence at the time and we were all very distressed, especially our 2 young daughters.\n9th- 12th August - we had no car so had to pay for taxis. Needless to say the mechanics report was also not emailed. With the help of our hotel we attended a meeting at the Vehicle Registration office in Ibiza town where we obtained a copy of the Jeep’s history (attached). As you will see it is 6 years old, not 2, with the next service due next month and several thousand kilometres completed since the last service.\nFurther to our credit card company's enquiries doyouspain returned a carbon copy of a signed agreement to admit that the damage was our responsibility. My signature had been forged and a date of 9th August, time 6pm entered as when the car was returned. On this date and at this time we were on Formentera island and have restaurant receipts and photos to prove this which were forwarded to our credit card company for them to question doyouspain. Funnily enough we heard no more from doyouspain and needless to say we do not recommend them as a professional car hire firm nor will we ever use them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:06:12.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Bought 2 2 yellow 564-xl for my HP Deskjet 3070 A. Machine would not accept them. This has happened before - that's why I bought 2 of yellow that I was out of and of others that I might need shortly, in the hope that if 1 didn't work the other would.\nNow I think I will have to switch to HP cartridges at much higher cost or buy a new machine. Very frustrating.\nHowever would still like to buy through Inkjet as buying from them is so simple & a good price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T12:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:43:09.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

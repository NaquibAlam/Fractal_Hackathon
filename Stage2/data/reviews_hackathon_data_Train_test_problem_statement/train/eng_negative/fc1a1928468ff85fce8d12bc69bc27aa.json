Following is the response from KLM when asked if they actually have a policy of no-refund for sickness. I was never given the re-booking option!!!!\n\"When booking your ticket through KLM, our policy is to rebook passengers to another date in case of illness. In that case you wont have to pay a penalty fee to change the ticket. Since you booked through a travel agent, the travel agent is responsible for your booking, so we can't help you with this, since the guidelines of your travel agency apply and we are not allowed to help you with this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T18:42:20.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

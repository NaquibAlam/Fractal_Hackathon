My rental car is covered in dust from sawing and this is terrible that although I called to verify that all was ok with this rental, i was never told construction would be taking place! There are drills and nails on steps up to apartment as well as handrails taken apart. This is ridiculous and i cannot move my 85 year old father at this point. I have stocked with groceries, etc and i am afraid that this will affect him walking. I will use back walkway for him but besides flying from ny for a vacation this is nothing I expected. I chose vacation rental pros because of the recommendations as i am a property manager in ny Hampton s and this is not acceptable. I appreciate your help.\nVRP REPLY AND MY RESPONSE - VRP Quote: :\nhello!\nMy apologies for such inconvenience. i can send the refund request when ever it is convenient to you. I can send this at anytime, even from home. My sincere apologies for such inconvenience.\nNext day after no response-i wrote-\nI have my 85 year old father here and he has ptsd and Alzheimer's disease, i cannot move him. We will stay in the back area and i will try to limit the front construction area. But absolutely i cannot change him. We have all our groceries, clothes etc in place and i have a return flight to ny on Sunday. He is being driven back to sc on Sunday by my sister who lives in saint Augustine. This was to be a relaxing quite vacation and i am very disappointed but i have already wasted too much time and do not want to\nFrom Barbara's iphone\nOn Dec 14, 2016, at 5:50 PM, VRP AGENT VRP AGENT-\nMy sincere apologies. I know you said you could not move today. Were you possibly looking to move tomorrow? I am processing the refund request now.\nT​hank you,\nI NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE So THEN I COMPLAINED TO OWNER OF VRPros\nThis was his response-\nOnce again, how long until I hear from someone. This is terrible! No response from your company. I have checked out at 8:15 this morning and still no call. I have called, emailed, sent pictures, videos, and still nothing. I am a vacation property rental manager in new york and this is unheard of.\nFrom Barbara's iphone\nOn Dec 17, 2016, at 11:33 PM, Steve Milo, President, Vacation Rental Pros Quote: :\nI just got your Survey…\nI’D LIKE TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT\nDear Barbara,\nThank you for emailing your Survey about your Vacation Rental Pros experience.

Do not trust them or give them your personal information , They can affect badly your credit report or credit score. Their team are not professional to assist you. When they inquire for your credit report , they usually use and add a hard inquiry to your credit report which will stay in your report for two years and affect your credit badly . That what they did with me and with my wife without any respectful reason or even my permission . They could use the soft inquire which is the normal and right one for any one who work in this field. When I asked them to fix this issue . They refused to remove this mistake or give me any support.One the other hand when I contacted the TransUnion credit company for this inquiry . They advised that the Quicken Loan company has the right to add or remove this inquiry. When I contacted this company to fix the issue after that they lied and told me that they could not do anything to help.Again don't trust this company for any services, You will lose your credit score very quick and easy to get a bad credit report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:28:31.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

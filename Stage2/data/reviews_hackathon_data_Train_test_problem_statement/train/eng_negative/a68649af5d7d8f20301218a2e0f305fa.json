They sent me a totally different product. No biggie I thought, I'll just send it back & get my suits. It is now Feb 2017 & I have not gotten ANYTHING back from them. I have over 20 emails going back & forth with their customer service. At one point they claimed they couldn't find my package even though I provided the dates & tracking info proving they had it. Finally they agreed to a store credit. By that time it had been 5 months & I didn't want anything from them anymore. I asked for a refund & they waited to respond till Oct agreeing to mail me a check within 6-8 weeks. When January rolled around I had still received nothing. I emailed them for an update & They told me they didn't know why nothing was mailed yet but would have upper management look into it. It's almost March....still no money, no emails, no calls. They basically stole my money & they don't care.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T21:21:18.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

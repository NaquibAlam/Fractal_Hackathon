My first experience was fine. The flowers arrived and they were pretty. The second was awful! I ordered a sympathy arrangement to be delivered at a church by 1:00 on a Saturday. I got a call from someone shortly after my order asking for the name of the deceased. I thought it odd, but I didn't argue. When I arrived at the service my flowers had NOT arrived. This was after I was promised by the associate the previous day that my arrangement would be there before 1:00. I had to call and sit on hold after the service, while I was trying to be with family, to figure out what happened. I was told the delivery man called the church that morning, but no one answered...So, you just decided NOT to deliver them? No one called ME!? I should of been called! I get placed on hold numerous times and I tell the associate, oh no I'm not busy and she tells me I'm welcome to hang up! Um what!? I paid for an over priced bouquet of flowers to be delivered and they weren't, and you're telling me I'm welcome to hang up!? Then she proceeds to argue with me as to who the flowers were for. I ordered the flowers I think I know who they're for! After over half an hour I finally got the flowers rerouted to the home of the recipient. I will NOT be using teleflora ever again.

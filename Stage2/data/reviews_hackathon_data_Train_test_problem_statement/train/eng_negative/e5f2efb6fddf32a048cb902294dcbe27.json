Website was not clear as to whether this was a single or pair of panniers. I requested clarification and was assured that it was for a pair. Would have been very expensive for a single and would have bouth elsewhere.\nParcel arrived and only a single pannier. Pannier delivered was Altura Dryline 32.\nCustomer service was almost useless. Every message was treated separately and they kept requesting photos that I had already sent. Cost of return via Australai Post was >$100 so asked them if it might be better if they arranged collections - reponse please send photos.\nFound out that ProBikeKit is a brand to \"The Hut Group\" and found email of media enquireies person \"Vili\". I sent an email suggesting that if ProBikeKit did not sort my problem that I would raise the matter with Trading Standards in UK and Quote: d the \"Consumer Contract Regulations 2013 and the Consumer Rights Act 2015\" which are the Rregulations and act which cover sale of goods.\nOn my next contact with ProBikeKit through the website things started to happen.\nShame it takes so lomg for ProBikeKit customer service to admit that they stuffed up.\nProBikeKit have arranged collection for return of item which has now been collected. I now await my full refund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:30:30.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

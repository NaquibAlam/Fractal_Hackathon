Their phone number for Custom Service is always offline. DX.com is good if you receive your purchase. From the moment you have a problem with shipping, you're on your own. I put an order on Dec 20th 2016. Order number 161220001098043067. Two packages were sent via China Post on Dec 23rd and Dec 26th. On Feb 2nd I opened a ticked because no package has ever arrived home. Truth is, DX.com lost tracking of them with China Post. Today, Feb 13th, I was still waiting for Staff to contact me. I managed to chat with Claudia, from Customer Service. She told me to wait more for Ticket Service answer. Nope, Claudia. Sorry. No more waiting. I just called my credit card to cancel the deal and I'm now officially disputing the purchase. And DX.com lost another good client, of course.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:02:54.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

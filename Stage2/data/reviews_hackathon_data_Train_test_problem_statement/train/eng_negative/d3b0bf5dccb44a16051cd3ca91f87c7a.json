I decided last week to use theh gift card and give them another chance. Upon delivery one guy put on shoe covers and the other two did not. When they started taking the plastic off my chair I had noticed that one of the guys did not have shoe covers on and was stepping all over a brand new rug in my lkiving room. Before I could say anything he was back out the front door. They tried to screw the inserts onto the chair and their was no holes to put the feet on. Then their was a tear on the side of the chair. They had to take the chair back and I had to reschedule the delivery. I understand their are mistakes, we are all human, but come on now. Both times I ordered from gardner white I had less than extrordinary experiances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:39:07.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

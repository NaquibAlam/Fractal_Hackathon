Yes, they surveyed the property and confirmed we had rat and mice droppings, yes they set traps & poison which you can buy in the hardware store for €2, yes they came and checked, however they didn't spot the hole through which they were most likely entering. After three week of checks and one mouse found, that was it, i never heard from them again. I had to do all the work myself when the rats re-appeared. Get down and dirty, find the entrance points, block them up, a relatively simple job, after being convinced they must be getting through a cracked sewer pipe, and you will need a camera survey !!!! Oh and by the way and extra €300 or so and oh now you need a rat flap, €600 ... no way, i sourced and fitted it myself for a fraction of the price... A rip off company if ever there was one ! I have learned my lesson, as always, just try it yourself or an alternative competitor !! I thought, for a neat fee as a major landlord, i could have the problem solved in one visit ! Well you live and learn ! Thank you Rentokil !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:37:11.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

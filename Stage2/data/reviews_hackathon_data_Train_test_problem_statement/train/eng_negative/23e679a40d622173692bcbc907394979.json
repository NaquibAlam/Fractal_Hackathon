Instead of working to rectify issue - much time spent by your rep explaining why there was little he could do. Perhaps your English customer base is accustomed to not having their issues resolved. I am not. I expected a request to reroute my order to be actioned. Instead after several hours of no response (during UK business hours) I received a long explanation why this was not possible. Oddly enough having contacted DPD couriers directly they were happy to oblige. Really poor service from your rep. Having spent Â£1000 I do not expect to return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T12:00:34.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

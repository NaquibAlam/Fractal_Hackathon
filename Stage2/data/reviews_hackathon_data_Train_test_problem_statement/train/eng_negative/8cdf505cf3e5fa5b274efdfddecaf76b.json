(Wallethub) would also Send Me Out Multiple Emails Telling ME That I Missed A Payment With American Express When I do NOT Owe Them A Penny And Closed My Account Back In The Year Of 2016 Due To Fraud That Was Committed Online Without My Signature, Permission, Authorization And I Was Also Out Of The Country When It Happened!\nAs I had stated this company is Useless and Does Not Deserve To Be In Business since They Do Not Send Me Out The Correct And Truthful Information Pertaining To My Personal Credit and/or Credit Reports.\nObviously.\nPlease NOTE: After recently receiving Numerous Bogus, Useless Emails From Them About the Fraudulent Transactions from American Express which I already know about since 2016 back when I had Closed My Account, I Got Very Angry And Upset At Them And Demanded Them To Stop Sending Me Their Junk Emails!\nWell, these Evolution Finance, Inc. (Wallethub) Employees Continued To Bother Me With Their Emails And Then I Had It With Them and Told Them That I Will Publish Negative Reviews About Them To Every Social Media Outlet Out There That I Work With And Told Them Off Really Good!\nOnce I Said That, Then They Decided To Close My Account And They Are So Pretentious About Everything That They Do And Say Online By Always Trying To Be Nice And Well Mannered Which Is All Fake Because They Are Too Busy Hiding Behind A Closed Wall With Just A Computer In Front Of Them.\nPlease...I Can't Stand Weak People Who Can Not Even Be Man Enough To Discuss Something Like This Over The Telephone, or Better Yet, In Person...Face-To-Face!\nI Dare Them!\nHowever, Since I Am An Executive Social Media Writer, Promoter and Reviewer With Google and Many Other Social Media Websites, I am NOW Publishing These Negative Reviews, Along With Documents To Show How Low Class Of A Company They Are.\nMy Advice To You Is Please Do Not Use Evolution Finance, Inc.(Wallethub).\nStay Away From Them!\nThey Are A Total Waste Of Your Time And Perhaps Even Your Money!\nThank you.\nSincerely yours, Howard Paul Shore\nAngry And Extremely Upset Non Customer Of Evolution Finance, Inc.

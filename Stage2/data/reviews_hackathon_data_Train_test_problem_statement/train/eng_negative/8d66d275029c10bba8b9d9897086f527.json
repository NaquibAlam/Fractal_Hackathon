For the first 18 months I received my products at a good price and had no problem with the automated delivery.\nAfter the initial period, however, the automated delivery just stopped. It showed up on my account, but the products never shipped. I called to inquire and was assured the products were shipping the next day. But they ever did. My card on file was also not charged. Last week (about a year and a half after auto delivery vanished) I logged back into the account and cancelled the auto ship. The account still read my next shipment was scheduled for over a year ago.\nWhen I cancelled the autoship, I made a new purchase (just a one-time purchase). Today after 7 days and the order not being shipped (it was an estimated delivery of 5-7 days) I called to inquire. After a long wait for a person at customer service I was told that they could not order an expedited replacement until a total of 7 business days had passed. Since I ordered on a Friday and inquired on a Friday, they could not take action until the following Wednesday (11 days after ordering). If I did not receive the unshipped order by Wednesday I was welcome to call back for a replacement. And no, there was no way to automate shipping the order, but the customer service rep offered to put a sticky note on her computer to check the account and if I had not received the unshipped order in 2 additional business days (from Friday today to Wednesday next week) she would call me.\nSo no, I won't be placing any more orders with Pure Formulas. Too many problems with their supply chain/shipping and order process. Much easier to order elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:53:57.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

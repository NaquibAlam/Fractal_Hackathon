On the 23th of january our flight from Copenhagen to Rome was canceled, and we got offered an alternative flight to GO to Rome on the 13th, so that we would ARRIVE in Rome AFTER our flight back home had left?!?!? Immediately I contacted Bravofly through telephone and was promised a quick solution to this problem - now, one whole month after, there is still no solution!! This is not okay at all!! I have contacted you every week since the 23th and I keep being told that you treat my case as an emergency, but still I never get a solution. I just want to go to Rome on the 8th as planned, or I want all of my money back, so we can find another company to plan our vacation through! I am writing here as it seems the only way to actually get your attention - and to warn everyone who expect some form of decent costumer service to book through your company!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:10:34.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

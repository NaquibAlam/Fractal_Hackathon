I was given a tracking number, expected delivery - nothing came on expected date. I looked at tracking on line it read - could not access road, will deliver next day, second day, same thing as before same comment. On the morning of the 3rd day I rang for an explanation and was told due to the nature of my road a small van was needed, indeed my package would be with me and delivered by a small van that day. An hour later i checked tracking, guess what? Could not access road, will deliver next day. Rang them again very sorry, opened a customer complaint file for me and guaranteed it would be with me the following day on a small van by 12. So day 4, driver rang me to tell me he could not access the road as he was in an 8 ton truck, would i meet him in town!! NO! Rang TNT again, incandescent with rage as driver also told me he had not tried to deliver that week so far and there were no small vans in my area anyway. Shouted and swore again at TNT was told they would go to great lengths to get my parcel off the big truck and get a small van to deliver it by 5pm. 5 minutes after this a small TNT van arrived and delivered my parcel, no knowledge of earlier truck or any communication with depot or complaints. So my parcel wasn't even on the drivers truck who rang!!! Do not use this company, they are liars and totally incompetent. I can only assume every time they said they were ringing the depot to sort out my problem they had me on hold while they had a laugh and a cigarette. Wasted 4 days and endless money on phone calls to them, had to have a plumber hanging about waiting for the parcel to finish a job and cancelled a day out with my daughter for her birthday to wait in for them. I do. Live on a narrow road but I have never had anybody else have a problem with delivery or consistently lie at every opportunity. Unprofessional and deceitful not to mention appalling service\nI will happily post this review on any website I can find and advise my friends and work colleagues never to use TNT", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:59:27.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

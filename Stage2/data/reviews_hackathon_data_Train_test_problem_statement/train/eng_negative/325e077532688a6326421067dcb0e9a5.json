I ordered same day service. They called the office and asked to speak to the employee the flowers were ordered for, then asked how what time the business was open until. She told them we were open until 6, but she'd only be there until 5. At 5:15, we called customer service and were told the route of delivery had to be changed to facilitate this order. My employee waited for the delivery past the time she was supposed to leave, because she knew they were coming. They delivered the bouquet only and forgot the balloon. The delivery was cold and they abruptly left. We again called customer service and advised them they forgot the balloon and just to credit it back to my credit card. Instead they delivered the balloon the following day. Totally unsatisfied with entire experience and this company's lack of customer service. Will not use again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:49:02.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

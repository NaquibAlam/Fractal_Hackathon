You could see the little icon spinning and spinning/thinking what seemed like forever and then all of a sudden it said my cart is empty. I had no idea if my order went through or not, as I didn't receive a confirmation email. I called your customer service line but had to leave a message. Later that afternoon a very nice csr returned my call and helped me with my order.\nSo...not sure if it was a one off thing or if you continuously have issues with your website. Just wanted to let you know.\nRegards,\nJackie", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T09:00:52.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

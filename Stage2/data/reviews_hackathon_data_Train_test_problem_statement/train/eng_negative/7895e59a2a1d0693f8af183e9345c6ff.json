Terrible service. Sent several messages to ask about status of my order and never got reply. Ordered flowers to be sent to my girlfriend's office in Kolkata and they never arrived. Such deliveries should be made within reasonable hours - latest 5pm. But when they rang my girlfriend it was already past 7pm and she was already home. They also didn't make clear whether they would deliver to her house instead and were extremely unhelpful and uncommunicative when she rang both the delivery man and the florist shop responsible. They even hang up on her and didn't answer further calls. Despicable manners and service which totally ruined what should have been a happy valentines day. While flowers finally arrived at nearly 9pm, this is too unacceptably late and the day and experience were already ruined. I've sent an email to demand a refund and apology but doubt i will get one given their lack of response and all the other negative reviews i've seen here. I only wish I saw these negative reviews earlier. Avoid this company at all cost. Would give them no stars if the system would allow me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:49:50.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

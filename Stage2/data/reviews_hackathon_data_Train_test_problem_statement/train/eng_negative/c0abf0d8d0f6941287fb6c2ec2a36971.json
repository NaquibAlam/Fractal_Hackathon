I paid a extra $15.00 to make sure they were delivered before 11:00AM. I was supposed to get a text confirmation telling me they were delivered. 3:30 comes around and my girlfriend left work without flowers. I look on the website to check order status and it still says out for delivery. I paid over $120.00 for these flowers and they weren't even delivered on within the window or even the day I paid for them. I ended up stopping at the store and picking up flowers on my way home so I wasn't empty handed on valentines day. I tried calling customer service 3 times now. each time I am on hold for over 30 minutes and give up because I have better things to do than sit on hold.\nThe website now says that the flowers are out for delivery today the day after valentines day, which is not what I ordered, the whole point of getting flowers delivered for valentines day is that they are delivered on valentines day.\nEither way I am very unhappy with this service and have already put in a dispute with my credit card company for a full refund. I did a little searching on the internet and it looks like there are a ton of other people that have had similar problems. I will noht be doing business with them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:45:47.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

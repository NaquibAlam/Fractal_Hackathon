First of all, I couldn't set up an account with ShopTo using the intended email address. And then when I tried to use an alternative email I found it had set up with the original email without any notification to say so.\nWhen I finally got access to this acccount and pre-ordered the game, it ended up doing so twice. This is really frustrating when you get charged before dispatch and can't get a full refund without phoning. Luckily my brother wanted a copy, but I will be very hesitant to pre-order again without certainty that the interface won't break and give me an unwanted outcome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T20:28:41.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

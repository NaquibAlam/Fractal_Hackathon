I was also told that this would be resolved within a matter of minutes.\nOn 16.03.17 at around 20:00 I received an email stating that the amendment had been rejected. I promptly telephoned the hotel who informed me that Lastminute.com had only contacted the hotel circa 20 minutes prior to receipt of my email. Nearly 24 hours after my initial phone call.\nThe hotel advised that had lastminute.com contacted them when I had initially called, the amendment would not have been rejected.\nThis was obviously a time sensitive situation as the hotel stay was 16.03.17 and the staff lied to me by stating they would resolve my situation within a matter of minutes.\nI then called the team again 16.03.17 at around 21:00, and was told by customer care management that he would personally resolve the issue by calling the hotel within the hour to corroborate my story, and call me back to discuss.\nOver 24 hours have passed since that phone conversation and I have yet to hear back from lastminute.com.\nThis is the second time I had spoken to the customer 'care' team, and on both occasions I have been told that the team would contact the hotel and resolve this situation, however on both occasions I have been lied to. This situation has neither been resolved, nor it appears has the lastminute.com team undertaken any of the works that were promised to me as a paying customer.\nOn top of that I find it utterly disgusting and offensive that lastminute.com would dare Quote: policy at me during a time of bereavement, especially when I have already undertaken a verbal agreement that the booking would be amended and the situation be resolved, irrelevant of policy.\nThis situation is NOT about the money, but about being lied to and treated with absolutely no sympathy or decorum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T17:20:38.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

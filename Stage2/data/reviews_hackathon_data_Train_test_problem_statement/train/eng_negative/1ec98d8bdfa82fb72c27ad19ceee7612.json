No one seems to know what is going on and they don't call you back when they say they will.\nMy car had been booked in for 4weeks for a full service. On the day my car was due for it service I had to ring service stop (which took me 20 minutes to get through to an agent) at 9.50am to find out why my car hadn't been collected between 8&9am as they had agreed when I booked my service.\nI was told by the agent I spoke to they couldn't get hold of the garage that my car was booked in with so their senior advisor would give me a call back when they got through to garage on their mobile.\nApproximately 20 minutes later, I received a call back from service stop to inform me they had got hold of the garage & someone was on there way to collect my vehicle & they would be with me shortly & they said the garage apologised as they forgot to call me. I accepted this and said that was fine if someone was on there way.\nI waited another 2 hours & my car still hadn't been collected. So I called service stop again at 11.50 to be put on hold & then be informed that my car wasn't going to be collected or serviced today as there had been a mix up. I told them this was unacceptable and wanted to speak to a manager.\nI was then placed on hold for a further 10minutes to be told manager was unavailable, I told agent I would wait, I was placed on hold for a further 15 minutes & I was finally put through to a manager who could give anu reason or explanation to why my car hadn't been collected.\nThe manager told me she could offer me Â£10 of if I rebooked even tho I had to take a day of work as service stop failed to have my car collected at the agreed time & they lied to me & said someone was on there Way even tho this was not case.\nAfter reading all the reviews online and my bad experience I would not recommend service stop Ltd to friends, family or colleagues.\nI will be sticking to local garages from now on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:24:28.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

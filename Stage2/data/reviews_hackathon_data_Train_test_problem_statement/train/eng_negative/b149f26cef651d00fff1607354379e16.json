I want to make a payment as I have done a hundred times before but their system security has flagged my payment and prevented it being processed. If I was just trying to buy some stuff on ebay it wouldn't be a problem but instead it is a business purchase and I need to make the payment now.\nFor two days their customer service team has told me that they have fixed the problem, but it is never fixed. I have called and called and called and every time I talk to them they tell me that \"that should do it\" or \"your ready to go now\" but it's just a bunch of BS. It's never fixed and they don't care that it isn't fixed. one lady suggested that I transfer funds directly to my paypal account to bypass the security system. too bad that takes 8 business days! the Bit*h didn't bother to mention that even though I had quite literally just finished explaining the urgent nature of the payment.\nTo summarize; paypal is great on ebay but only because paypal owns ebay. For everybody else, stay away from paypal and don't ever count on their customer service team doing what they say they will. For that matter don't ever count on paypal period! It seems that they don't ever come through when you need them. (for the record this is not the first bad experience I've had with paypal but it will definitely be the last)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T23:14:40.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

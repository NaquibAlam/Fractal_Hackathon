UnlockRiver provided the unlock thru the MetroPCS unlock app. Problem is that my S6 was sold BEFORE MetroPCS added the remote unlock code to their phones. So I require a numeric code, just like the S5 line. I contacted UnlockRiver's support people, and got the less-than-helpful runaround. This used to be a good company to do business with, and I unlocked several phones with their help previously. I won't be using them again.

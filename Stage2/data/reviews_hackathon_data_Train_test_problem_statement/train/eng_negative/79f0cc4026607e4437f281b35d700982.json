I received two of the items quickly and am happy with the products for the price. The other orders have not arrived yet one says it shipped December 25, 2016 but I still have not received it, the other still shows as processing since January 10th 2017, Customer service keeps trying to tell me that the items were out of stock and \"have just come back into stock\" however the sales site always says they are in stock but they have not shipped and they refuse to cancel or refund my money. It is now March 10th 2017. Still waiting Tomtop, this experience overall really sucks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T10:38:51.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

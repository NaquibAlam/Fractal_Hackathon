I then realised I couldn't hear anything at all and the person on the other side couldn't hear me either. Then I thought I would try another number and it happened again, turns out the phone was faulty and I couldn't make calls at all. What kind of company sells phones without doing the very simple thing of checking it actually calls out and works???? I then realised the phone don't vibrate either, so this so called company asked me to send them the phone, I am now nearly £300 down and without a phone and they tell me there is no compensation and i have to wait up to 10 working days for another phone or to fix the one i sent them, it's ridiculous. i wish I used another company and never had dealt with them. I have to wait 10 working days without a phone at all now. I would give them absolutely ZERO stars if i could and I will be putting this review on every review company i come across and will not be recommending this company to anyone at all and advise everyone to stay well clear from them", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:12:11.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I ordered Valentines flowers for my wife who works in a school and thought it woul be a nice suprise for her to receive at her workplace. I later realised that she will be on half term holiday, and called customer services to change the address within 24 hours of placing the order and spoke to an advisor after 45 mins of holding. Simple enough you would have thought. Much to my dismay not only can they not change the address but they cannot cancel and refund. Will not be using such a incompetant company again. Also the website doesn't display any details of the order, very poor customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:54:09.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

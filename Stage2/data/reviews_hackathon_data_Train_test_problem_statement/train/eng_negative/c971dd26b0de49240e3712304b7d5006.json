I cam across this one. I went to order an ark server with 4 slots because the option was there and the price was at 5.75 cad. so i went to place my order and said i needed an account so i was like ok. made one and then went to place it again and it was grayed out screen with a pop up saying you need to charge your account with money. ok. so i get my friend to donate 3$ and i charged 5$ in total it was 8$CAD. when i went to order again it said minimum slot was 8 and that it now costed 14$CAD. I wanted my money back so i went to support. They said\nAgain, I am very sorry for the missunderstanding on the webpage of us. We do not want to rob our customers.\nI will forward this ticket to the corresponding department, to fullfill the\nrefund.\nIÂ´d ask for your patience and understanding.\nThe money was taken out of the account the next day. A week later no money was refunded and i had to escalate the dispute on paypal. They basically stole my money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T10:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T21:50:26.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

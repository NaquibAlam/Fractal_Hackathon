I was hoping that the product was going to work with my Epson 300 & help with the cost of the ink. I followed the instruction & printed my sheet & the color was terrible,not even close the right color, so I email the company & they responded with instructions which i did twice, it still didn't work. So i asked to get a refund & was emailed that they would send a free label to send back the product. Said it would be there in 2-5 business day, waited pass the the business days after emailing that I never received the label, so I sent it back myself with the Post Office. I even email that i had it sent back with the instruction I was told to do, even sent in back in same package the was sent to me... I have had no responses from them yet. I guess I just lost $ 30 + on a product I couldn't use.... Very disappointed & will not recommend them to any of my friends....", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:37:40.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

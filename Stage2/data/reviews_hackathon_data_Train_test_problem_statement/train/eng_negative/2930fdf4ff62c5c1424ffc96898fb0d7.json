So placed an order#01711047 on feb 4th here and never got a confirmation email. Called on feb 5th to see what's going on and the guy (Completely unprofessional) said we are going to deliver less flowers and chocolates instead cake. I was like why did you let me order then and even if you did you should have contacted me with that info. Today feb 6th on the delivery date, nothing got delivered. I will surprised if someone actually reads this review as I was calling the helpdesk this morning and no one picked up. Worst experience ever. I was very reluctant on using sites to send gifts to India and now I know why.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T04:26:54.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They second suit arrived a week later and it was not what I ordered. I contacted the company and they said just keep the one that they shipped in error and asked if I wanted a store credit. When I told them no, I wanted a full refund, their tune suddenly changed. They advised me that even though they screwed up the order, I would have to ship back the item, AT MY EXPENSE, in order to get a full credit! Even though I used Paypal, I was not protected. The companys name is DESE Enterprises and if you look at the complaints on the BBB they are famous for ripping off their customers this way. They have a F rating with the BBB.\nORDER #102016754", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T22:49:18.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

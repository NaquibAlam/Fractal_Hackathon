After a pleasant conversation with Chris, and after he said he checked our name in his files, he advised me to do so.\nI sent it by express post with a tracking # for $21.85. The next day, Roy left me a message saying he had received a package sent in error by me because it contained another company’s product.\nPuzzled, I called and spoke with Chris who confirmed that he had made a mistake when he told me to send it to them. He said this kind of thing has happened before because there are a number of companies with similar names and products. I agreed and reminded him that that was why I had phoned him in the first place. In this case, Chris said that when he checked our name, he mistakenly confused it with another customer and would return the unit to me.\nA week later, I received a call from Roy asking why I had not followed up on the voice message he had left me and advising that he still had the unit. I said that I had indeed followed up, spoken with Chris, and had been wondering why it had not yet been returned to me. To my surprise, Roy said he would send it back COD. I said that I was certain that sending it back COD was not what Chris had planned to do, given the mistake was his. Roy argued that I had returned the unit to their company in error. I agreed that I had done so, but only because Chris had directed me to. Roy said he would check with Chris and call me back. The next day, instead of receiving a phone call, the unit arrived at my door at the cost of $16.88, COD.\nI was stunned. In the course of moving my father into long-term care, I was in contact with numerous health and support services, banks, cable and telephone companies, etc. Each and every individual I spoke with treated me with courtesy and care. An emotionally difficult task was made a little lighter and I was grateful for this. Every interaction was professional and efficient—until I had the misfortune of contacting Galaxy Medical Alert Systems. Their poor customer service and extensive miscommunication is unacceptable. Now, $53.18 later, the unit is on its way to the correct location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T21:56:34.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

All went well, until car was returned and getting home. The car rental firm was then pulling 120USD for something I have no idea what it was.\nContacted Autoescape who said it was because of refueling. I refueled the car at the airport and still had the receipt so sent it to them. After 20 mails and 3 phone calls, they still refused to put this money back, and had an exceptionally bad attitude.\nI reported them to Mastercard for using my credit card without authorization, and Mastercard reimbursed me.\nSuch an inserious company, without customer service should not be able to operate. I am lucky I did not have to deal with an accident case with them.\nStay far far away", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T15:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T12:09:26.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

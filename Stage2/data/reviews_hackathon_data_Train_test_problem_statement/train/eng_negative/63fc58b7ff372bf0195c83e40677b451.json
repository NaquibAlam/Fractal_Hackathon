After having that streightened out, on October 6, 2016 I confirmed by email to proceed with the rental and requested that it include the extra insurance and extra driver. This should have been covered with a Full Rate package at 772.84 Euros. However When I picked up the car on January 15th, the attendant told me that they had reserved it under the basic rate and that the cost now for the full insurance, extra driver, and petrol will now cost me 813.49. At the time of pick up, on January 15, 2017, I had just arrived from a 12 hour flight and did not have the email showing that I had requested on October 6, 2016 what should have been booked as a Full rate. When I returned the car they told me that they could not help me and that I should email them when I got home. Two emails later no reponse\nAlso although I requested a GPS the attendant failed to advise me that the model car I rented included a GPS and therefore I did not need to rent one at an extra cost of 60 Euros. I only noticed the GPS in the car when I arrived in Nerja and could not return the one that I rented also no response from my emails.\nWe will be returning to Malaga in the future but will not deal with Malagacar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:23:11.291+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

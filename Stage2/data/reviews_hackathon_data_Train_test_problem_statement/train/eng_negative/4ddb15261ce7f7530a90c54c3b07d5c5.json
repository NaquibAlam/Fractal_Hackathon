The points add up and the refunds are nice. Unfortunately that's as far as it goes. I've had restaurants take more than 3 hours to get my food to me and foodler just says \"We're sorry have $5 we can't do anything.\" Most recently I had an order where it was wrong. I called the restaurant and they were all bubbly and happy to make things work for me. Ten minutes later I get a call asking me to give them my food when they arrive (I actually just threw it away). When I said I couldn't do this because it was thrown away they slammed down the phone. I'm now actually concerned about eating this food and foodler just says we can't refund so sorry have $5 in foodler bucks. Not in refund, foodler bucks. Which means that if I want any part of this order I wasted money on to come back to me, it'll be in foodler bucks and I have to use their platform again. I've had 3 email exchanges with them in 40 minutes. I've also been on hold in the hopes that I can work this out with someone instead of just emailing back and forth. I've now been on hold for 40 minutes and they're refusing to work with me via email and probably won't actually pick up their phone. To add to this since Foodler replied, their support team didn't contact me other than to say to bad so sad restaurant won't refund your order. I now have to deal with a chargeback where I dispute this charge at the bank level and Foodler is refusing to literally do anything. I do not recommend doing this. I know there are other alternatives out there and honestly the issue for me is in accessibility as foodler for the most part is accessible for those who are blind and using screen reading software, but I hope now more than ever that other companies made their platforms accessible. I don't even plan on spending this $5 in foodler bucks. I've never been more irritated and I think it's just a bit absurd that Foodler appologises and tells me their support team has been in contact with me to get a good public image. No, they have not.

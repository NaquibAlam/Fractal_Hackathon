I finally placed an order and am sure I will have to return the leggings because they were not available in my size. Nothing I liked was available in my size. Also, I find it VERY disconcerting that I was unable to use my \"gift certificate\" and receive items at a sale price. It is outrageous that a person has to choose between purchasing an item at a sale price or using a \"gift certificate.\" Just so we are clear - gift certificates are $$ that customers SHOULD be able to spend in anyway they like. Not allowing customers to receive a discount and use their gifted $$ is not a good way to do business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:41:45.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

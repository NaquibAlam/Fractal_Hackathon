We spent $1400 on a set for our patio. After only 2 years, the fabric on the furniture has literally begun to disentegrate. After contacting customer service we were offered nothing by way of assistance. We were told there was originally a 6-month warranty from the manufacturer and since that time has passed \"Sorry thereâ€™s really nothing we can do at this point.\" This was after asking if there was anything at all they could do (i.e., offer to replace the cushions in question, offer contact information for the manufacturer, anything at all to help us since it was not a cheap set and lasted a very short amount of time considering the price). Had this been a cheap set, we would not have this feeling, but we expected more out of the set and out of this company.

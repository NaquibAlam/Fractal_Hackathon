Having looked online this appears to be a common problem with the LG G4, to which LG have admitted.\nThe rest of my story is the reason why you should never buy an LG phone or possibly any other LG product.\nI rang the LG Repair Centre and on my first call they asked for the IMEI number printed inside the phone. On giving this I was told that mine was a Taiwanese phone and as such not covered by the warranty - apparently the components are different. Really LG? Why does it work anywhere in the world then? LG refused to repair the phone or even to take the phone back to repair it if I offered to pay. The phone is one year and three months old and in otherwise perfect condition. LG said my only recourse was through the online retailer from whom I purchased.\nSo I looked up the online retailer then called the LG Repair Centre back. This time I was told that LG would not honour the warranty because my retailer had bought the warranty from LG, so my only recourse was back through that retailer. I have subsequently found that the retailer is no longer trading. Hard luck on me.\nInterestingly in neither call did LG ask how old the phone was, they were keen to use other excuses than the phone being out of the warranty period.... I wonder why?\nFinally the LG representative said that if I was prepared to pay for the repair then I could send the phone to a third party and gave me a name and number with whom I could get the phone fixed. Nice.\nSo to recap:\n- The LG G4 is a top of the line mobile and has a known fault, to which LG have admitted.\n- But LG will use different excuses as to why they will not repair the phone under warranty e.g. it's Taiwanese, 'different' or the retailer bought the warranty.\n- LG will also not repair your device even if you offer to pay, but will refer you to a third party.\nLG this is very poor. You are not taking any responsibility for producing a faulty design, selling it to unsuspecting customers that buy in good faith and then refusing to provide any redress. As a company your attitude stinks and I would urge all my friends, in fact anyone out there not to buy an LG phone or any other LG device because they simply don't stand by their products.\nYou have been warned.

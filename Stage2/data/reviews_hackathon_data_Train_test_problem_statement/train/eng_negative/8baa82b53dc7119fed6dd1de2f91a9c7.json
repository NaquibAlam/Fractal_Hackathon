He then ripped the cover even more to explode the bottom of the sofa. I then ask for a new one but the manager stated it wld be another week. Being that I was unsatisfied and disappointed the manager stated he wldnt put a rush on the order and the warehouse was local. Then he wldnt deliver it for free he stated I had to pick it up. After feeling like I was getting no where w this guy I ask for corp. # he stated they don't have one and gave me a email alli@homezonefurniture who NEVER replied or tried to assist to make things better!! I will NEVER refer or buy anything from Home Zone again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:00:10.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

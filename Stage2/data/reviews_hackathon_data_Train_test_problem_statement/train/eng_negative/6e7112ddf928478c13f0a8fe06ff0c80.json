They're so awful. They never knock, just dump your box on the doorstep. There can be multiple cars in the driveway and they still won't bother knocking.\nThey dropped the box off in the middle of a monsoon, without knocking of course, leaving me with a soggy box and junk inside.\nThey don't update their shipping info. I've had something sitting in Ontario for a week now. Just sitting there. Despite the fact that it was supposed to arrive 5 days ago.\nDo they even work?

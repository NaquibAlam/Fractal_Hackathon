I tried to check on the 17th but there was no record of my order. I called several times and found out that my order had been cancelled because they ran out of flowers. However, I was never informed that the order was cancelled. If I had been called I could have made other arrangements. Matter of fact, I was billed for the flowers the day I placed the order. Now I will be waiting 6-10 days to be reimbursed.

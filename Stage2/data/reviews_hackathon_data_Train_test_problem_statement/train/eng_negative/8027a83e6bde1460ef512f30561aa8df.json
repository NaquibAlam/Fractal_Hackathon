G. convinced and I sent the camera back, (the return shipping as I got to pay?) since 28-11-1016 have you had my camera. Krystal King of B. G. have promised and promised ... but nothing more happened. This means that I have paid for a fully functional product that I have not been able to use the over 7 months, how do B.

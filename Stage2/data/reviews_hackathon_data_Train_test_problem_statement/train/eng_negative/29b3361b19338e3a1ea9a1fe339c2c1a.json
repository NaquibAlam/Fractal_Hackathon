I ordered some flowers directly on the webpage and there was a message that said \"available for tomorrow\". So I ordered for the next day of my purchase.\nThe day that they were supposed to be delivered (January 31st, 2017) I got an e-mail from you guys asking if I still wanted them for the next day (February 31st, 2017) because there were not availability. I agreed and asked if they could add more flowers for this dela (because i was my friend's birthday). You guys replied that you were sorry but it was a difficult one and that you would check because the florists usually closed on Wednesdays. So I waited for the response and I just received the news that my friend already received some flowers that were nothing in comparison that what I tasked! Totally different ones without asking me!\nI am completely sad about this situation and I woudl really expect you guys to send the ones I ordered.\nAll the best,\nRebeca", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T05:48:46.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

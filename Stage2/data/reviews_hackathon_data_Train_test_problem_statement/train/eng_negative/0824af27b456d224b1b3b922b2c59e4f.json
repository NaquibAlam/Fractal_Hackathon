They told me the problem would be solved in 24 h. The day after I got an email where I was told the problem would be managed in 30 business days (after the period I would be on holiday). It seems they haven't direct contacts with hotels (It works like Chinese boxes) and none from customer services can't help you. The hotel manager told me they would cancel (for free) my booking but even this was not sufficient to get back my money. I sent everything to The Swiss Ombudsmen office in order to avoid that other people can be caught in this trap.\nCUSTOMER SERVICE IS UNUSEFUL (THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO DEFINE IT). BETTER NOT TO BUY THERE\n---AMOMA--- 4.46 p.m. 15th Feb 2017 (modified after your feedback)\nAlready contacted you 10 times without results. It's the same to talk to a wall!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:57:34.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was recommended by the store staff to engrave the name on the box instead of the pen..We do not like the pen as it looks different as the one in the picture, neither do we like the fact that the engrave was on the gift box that nobody keeps..., therefore we decided to exchange to another one. We called the store and was told that we cannot returned or exchange as the box was engraved. We were willing to pay for the box but was told again it is not possible. I don't understand, why a piece of metal that was glue on the box in front of us so irreplaceable...and why we cannot return a pair of pen that is not engraved and is purchased yesterday... It is very unreasonable. It was the first time we purchase from store and honestly we are not impressed at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T08:34:37.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

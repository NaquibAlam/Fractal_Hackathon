Unfortunately, if you end up with a bad one, Rover assume no responsibility or assistance at all. They do have a so-called insurance protection but just like any insurance plan, they deny all claims to save money. The guarantee is merely a scam, so good luck with this. I am not going to use it anymore and will trust a chain franchise like Camp Bow Wow or Petsmart instead. At least the staff there are more reliable and are held responsible for their actions.\np.s Thank you for the response. As always, your company provided many \"empty\" apologies via email without any true action or compensation. Refusing to issue any refund, compensation, issue disciplinary actions or even provide assistance working with an insurance company all the way in Southfield, MI, who refused to review any evidence I would like to present from NY and rejected any claim submitted. You have kind words to wish my pets well, but I don't trust your service or guarantee anymore. Even Uber take responsibilities about their drivers and have disciplinary actions against their drivers, whereas your sitters are still practicing with 5-star reviews despite complaints and reports of negligence. For refusing to take any action towards your negligent sitters, it is your negligence also!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:32:42.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

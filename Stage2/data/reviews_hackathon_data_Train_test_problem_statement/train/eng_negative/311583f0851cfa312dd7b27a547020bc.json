Both times our rooms were booked 3 to 4 weeks in advance. All 4 times we got to the motel to find that they did not have things that were supposed to be there like food, microwave, internet, working fridge etc. One of them we drove a 30 mile round trip off the freeway, because they had a neat little bridge crossing the creek in the back yard. As it turns out, the bridge has been gone for 4 or 5 years. When confronting staff about these discrepencies, they blame in on Trivago, saying they have tried several times to get these things changed or fixed. Is there any reason why I should try Trivago again?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:56:21.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

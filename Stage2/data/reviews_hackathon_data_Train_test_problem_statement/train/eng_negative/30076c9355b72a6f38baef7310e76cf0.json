All the $50 outfits are cropped leggings and tanks which I don't wear. So what if you pick a $70 outfit? To get the long leggings and long sleeve top but oh wait, the top is a crop top which yet again I don't wear to the gym. So you try to just get the leggings.. $50. So you try to use the promo code they are advertising for 30% off to get a little less ridiculous but still high price, now you can't use your credit that you pay for every month. So what is the point? That is ridiculous. You can get leggings that are better quality for half the price anywhere. Not to mention the product is sewn wrong so now I have a gaping hole on the seam of my top From the outfit I paid $90 for.. VIP is not a good deal so don't fall into the trap", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T13:40:00.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

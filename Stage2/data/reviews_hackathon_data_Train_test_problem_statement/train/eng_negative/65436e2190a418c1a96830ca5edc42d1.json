Several times he mentioned how fast everything ships out because it is always in stock.\nSo if finally, placed an order with eFaucets on line late at night. And then order a couple more items the next morning. I call customer service at 9: 30 am to see when the order would ship and was told that my order would not ship for 3 to 5 days and would take 4 to 5 days to arrive. I told them that was too long and that I was going to find the fixtures locally.\nI called back at 11:15 am and talked to customer service and told them that I needed to cancel both orders. I was told OK it was no problem, and they would cancel the orders. There was no mention that I could not cancel the order nor was I told that the orders had already been sent to shipping and could not be stopped. I went and purchased the fixtures locally. The customer service person made NO attempt to find out exactly when or where the items were shipping from. Something two other customer service people told me he could do.\nTwo days later I get a call from a trucking company tryining to deliver a bath tub and toilet from efaucets. I tell them that I had cancelled the order and was not accepting it.\nI called efaucets explained what had happened and they apologized for the mistake but said they don’t accept cancellations of orders. Even though what I was told was wrong.\nThey never mentioned that they charge for refused orders or returned orders.\nA couple of days later I received some more of the fixtures and call customer service again explaining the whole situation and ask if I could cancel whatever hadn’t shipped and wanted to return the product that came in. The customer service person said they would take care of it and again did not mention anything about a restocking fee. She told me that the first person should have told me that everything ships right away and should have told me that it would be three to five days before it shipped. She said she was going to get with the supervisor and make sure this is all straightened out because what I was told was wrong.\nA few days later I receive a piece and I again call customer service. They confirmed that it was all set up to return everything. In the approximate 5 minutes talked to person about returning the product she never, not even hinted that there would be a restocking fee.\nTonight if find out that they are charging me a 15% restocking fee and I am paying for the shipping back.\nAnother Important point is that you really, I mean really need to make sure you know what you need as they are useless in helping you figure out all the little pieces needed to order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T10:34:40.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

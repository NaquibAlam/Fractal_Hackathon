Hi Eddy , this seams like this is the only way we can communicate on Trustpilot . As you say you have spent a fair bit of time going back and forth . How disappointing ! And as you say \" Frustrating \" that no one from Australian Solar Quote: s can pick up the phone and sort out any communication frustrations quickly . Maybe ASQ are in Australia , maybe overseas , maybe Bots replying ! Makes it Hard to build up Rapport !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:28:40.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Shane was highly recommended to us by the management after the first two drivers contracted with failed to show for pickup. I was sending a puppy from Ohio to Arizona. Shane seemed to be very responsible and caring. NOT- instead of taking the puppy to its destination he took the pup to his home. Every day we tried contacting him and finally after 13 days we had to get the police involved. Citizen Shipper did try to talk to him and offered to send someone for the pup, but Shane refused and demanded full payment for a pup he did not deliver and threatened to either keep the pup or sell it. Good thing the pup was micro chipped and registered. Only after police were involved did Shane take the pup to its destination. I don't really fault Citizen Shipper but they do need to be more thorough with their hiring practices. Be very careful shipping pets of any kind and never send an unregistered and microchipped pet. I will never use these folks again as I had a bad experience with not one but three drivers. And be very wary of Shane, it's not safe to ship even a pet rock with him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:05:09.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

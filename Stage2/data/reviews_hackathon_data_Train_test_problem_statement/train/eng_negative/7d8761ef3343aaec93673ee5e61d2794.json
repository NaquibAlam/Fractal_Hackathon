Good contact, good information, very knowledgeable and considerate agent (Che Oh). The paper work was signed and notarized in a week. Everything they requested of me was provided. I took the training the following week. Four weeks later, not a word. I called Che and she got right on it. She made sure the appraiser was sent (late September).\nGoing into October, I'm told that my credit report is not good. The credit report was 3 years old and totally inaccurate. Within days I faxed the documentation to refute the credit report. Everything was a go.\nEnter Matt. Matt is either very incompetent or extremely overworked. Now were in November. He tells me that all of the previous documentation I provided is now too old, and he needs more current check stubs, retirement papers, etc. Faxed the next day. Matt calls again to say that he needs a certified copy of my daughter's death certificate. Che arranged for this document to be provided to the notary.\nNow we're in late November. The notary comes out and I sign all of the documents, and provide her with the certified certificate. Che says I should receive my money by December 1st. December 15th not a word. I call again for status. Matt calls to say that he cannot verify my employment - where did he think the check stubs were coming from?? I provided my employers phone number.\nI finally received my money on Dec 22nd. The amount was for $2700. What happened to my $3900. I called Che, no answer. I called Matt, got voicemail - left a message. I emailed Jason Bresnock. He responded that he was on vacation. As of today, Feb 6, 2017 I have not heard from either one of these people. I'm too frustrated to pursue the matter any further at this time. Needless to say, I am not happy with AAG. I would not refer anyone to AAG. I would never use AAG again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:45:01.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

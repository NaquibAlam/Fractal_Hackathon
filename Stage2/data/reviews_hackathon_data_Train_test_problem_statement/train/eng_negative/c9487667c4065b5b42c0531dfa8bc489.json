I made my reservation on last Sunday (5th March) late evening and I wanted to reserve an early departure (around 6 am) but with the combination I wanted the system kicked me out twice and had to restart booking. In the end after confirmation I saw that I got the tickets to the departure of 6 pm (instead of 6 am), and the whole went very fast and I am sure I never clicked on the later flight, it was automatically done by the system in my opinion.\nIt is not my first online flight reservation and I know I was little bit upset but I am 100% sure i never clicked on that combination on which I confirmed later- to my big surprise and then \"shock.\"I wanted to call the client service immediately but it was too late 9pm Sunday, so I wrote rapidly an email (no answer since then...) and the next morning I could reach the office and someone who was supposed to help. Instead I faced a very impolite and not really kind manner of 'service clientele' and the worker almost lectured me rudely and directly that I should have paid attention more. She was basically right but I wanted to express my opinion that the evening before the system of connections.be was not really working well and caused me lot of nervousity and i am sure I never clicked on the flight combination which i bought in the end. But she did not really care instead she offered me the possibility of changing the tickets 100eur /person. I said no thank you and finished the conversation with bitter mouth...Its not my first time reservation with this company and I know I should have paid attention but at least I could have expected something else of treatment.\nupdate: I just clicked on my reservation and I just see that my inbound flight is cancelled and I never received any info about this :( what is going on?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T23:29:11.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

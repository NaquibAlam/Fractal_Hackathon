They're the good points. I certainly didn't expect them to arrive in a box. Look nothing like the photo on the website - described as \"Glorious\" on the website but far from it. Free chocolate box is tiny. I wish I'd stuck to my original plan and bought a beautiful Mother's Day bouquet for less money at Marks and Spencer. In fact, I will probably go and buy some from M&S because I don't want my mum to be disappointed. I am extremely disappointed. Would not recommend. Not good value for money. Never again.

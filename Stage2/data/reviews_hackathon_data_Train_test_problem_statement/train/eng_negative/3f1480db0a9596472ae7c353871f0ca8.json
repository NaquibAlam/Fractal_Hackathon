Sales were nice and helpful. Funiture looks great and feels great on the floor. Everyone seems friendly when purchasing. Since our first purchase the we have had one of our 2 items we purchased replaced due to the reclining portion not latching less than a month later. Super easy just called explained it and the manager had a new one ordered and here in less than a week. Now here we are less than 90 days from purchase and the love seat is making a metal on metal grinding when it rocks and the replament has the seam threads falling out. Tried to call back and tell them they need swapped out and now oh no you have to photo everything and send it to us to be sent to the claims to see if its covered. When we purchased the extra warranty stuff it was explained just call tell us what's going on and we will get another set out to you. So beware what you purchase and what warranty services you purchase as well it may not be worth the hassle. If you do purchase I highly suggest getting delivery replacement or you will have to lug that furniture back and further yourself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:17:50.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

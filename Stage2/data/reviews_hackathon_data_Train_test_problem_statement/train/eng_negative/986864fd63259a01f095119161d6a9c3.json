Called FlightHub and they said it was due to their airline being unable to provide a 'flight segment' and that their system had sent me an automated email at 11:44 pm 48 hours after I had booked my trip. Essentially, even if you are spending $4000, it doesn't matter enough for them to call you to tell you they have cancelled your entire purchase - their effort only goes as far as automated middle-of-the-night emails that end up in your spam box. We had to re-book new flights at double the price (directly with an airline this time!) because after 3 hours on the phone with FlightHub they refused to take any responsibility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:52:50.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

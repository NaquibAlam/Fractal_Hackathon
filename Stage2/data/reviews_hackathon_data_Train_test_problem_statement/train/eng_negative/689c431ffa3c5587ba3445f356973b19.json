I changed my booking when a cheaper car became available and Argus sorted it out no problem.\nThe problem started when I arrived at the Sicily By Car desk. The queue was massive. They had a semi - operational ticket system going where you had to pick a ticket and wait for your number. At some points the tickets would run out and people wouldn't know they had to take one. After a nightmare 2.5 hour wait at the desk we got allocated the car I had booked.\nAfter going to the collection point, our car was still being valeted and we were told we would have to wait 10-15 more minutes for it to be ready. The lady from Sicily By Car was also not impressed by this, she decided to give us a better car instead. (This was not her being nice. She clearly said she didn't want people in her office and she wanted to get rid of us!!)\nI booked a ski rack to go with the car. After checking the car for damage I asked the lady from Sicily By Car how the ski rack was fitted. As she was walking off, she just shrugged her shoulders and said \"Its magnetic, I don't know\". Not very Helpful!\nOverall the car was good but the service was appalling. If it wasn't for the good price we got from Argus Car Hire I would be giving it a 1*.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T08:06:03.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

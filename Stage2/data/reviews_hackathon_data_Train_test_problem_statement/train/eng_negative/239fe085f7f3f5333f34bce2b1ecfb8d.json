After i arriver at Venice airport,i wait for the shuttle to go to the rental car office.When i arrived there,i get inside and said \"bongiorno\",a lady came from behind and did not answer to me.After this,i did not care and just told her that i had a booking,i tried to bring a good atmosphere and asked her if she want to drink a tea or coffee as i was drinking one,she said \"I NO WANT\".Then she tried for many minutes to sell me many insurances,i explained her that as i own a VISA PREMIER card i do not need any insurance,she keep trying,for many minutes more,it was really annoing as my wife and my children were really tired from fly and crying.I was polite and told her \"no thanks\".She told me \"ok,up to you if you want pay a big deposit\".After that she asked me my card to take the deposit,usually i never pay more than 600 euros for deposit,sometime it can be 900 euros but never more,she asked me for 1700 euros deposit!!!! The transaction was refused,so she came back and said \"why you not pay 200 euros fees?So there will not be any deposit.I told her that what she was doing was not correct,trying to put a big deposit for the caution is refused so i will accept to pay the fees to avoid the deposit.I said \"no\",then she looked at me and said \"why dont you go back to your country,why did you come to Italy?\" I left the office and stayed outside,at that time i was devastated,so a staff member came to me and said what happened?so i explain him all,he said that it was not first time this lady got problems with customer and asked to wait,and that he will call another company to come pick me up to rent a car,after 2 minutes a car came to pick me up and bring me to pick up a car with a 1 EURO deposit!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T11:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T18:24:46.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

No problems with the booking or picking it up and the staff were really helpful.\nI didnt buy the extra excess insurance as I bought my own - its generally cheaper.\nWhen getting the car, the operator told me I would be charged for a full tank of diesel which worked out at €46. I was then promised that any unused fuel would be refunded! All very good I thought!\nSo when I dropped off the car at the airport in the multi storey car park to another operator there, I showed her how much was left in the car. It was 25%.\nI was expecting a refund of about €11.\nInstead, when I checked my credit card they had taken a further €43 out off of my card (the one which had had €1100 locked off as a deposit.\nI tried phoning but the Goldcar operator from the UK when I returned home could not clearly explain why the second amount had been taken out without my permission.\nI had to contact my credit card to explain what had happened and got the amount refunded by the credit card company!!!\nI would advise to be very careful when booking with this company - and even warn that if possible to avoid.\nOh and the car was in exactly in the same condition on return as when I collected it!\nFor your reference Goldcar the contract was 10979615 if you want to look into this with your right to reply! Look forward to the reason why!??", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:21:47.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Also, the inside of the case was completely scratched up. I have a black phone, so as soon as the case was on I could tell that it was damaged and it made my phone looks old and beat up (the case is - for the most part - clear). I've sent an email to the company and am taking photos so that I can send another and I've also talked to an advisor on live chat that simply told me to send another email. I spent 50 canadian dollars on this case and it's too late to get a refund. What a waste of money! The only thing positive that came out of this is that the case is fairly decent quality and does a good job of protecting my phone. But whenever I decide to use the case, it makes the back of my phone look scratched.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:26:54.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

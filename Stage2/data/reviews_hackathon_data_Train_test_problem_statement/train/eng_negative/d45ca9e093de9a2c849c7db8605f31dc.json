I searched for resorts where kids stay free and bookit still tried to include the cost in taxes. For instance, I needed 2 rooms, both with 2 adults and 1 kid. One child is 1 and the other is 11 years old. I received a Quote: for a free child ( room with the one-year-old) and I had to pay for the 11-year-old. ( that is fine with me) The price Quote: I received for the room with the 1 year old had almost 400 dollars in taxes and fees ( equivalent to the cost of 1 extra person in the room and 1/2 of the over all price). The second reservation for the same exact room and dates had taxes for only forty dollars. What a scam. when i called customer service for an explanation, no one could help. i have screen shots of both Quote: s made at the same exact time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:12:33.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Waited all day because of the heat. Rang them in the afternoon and was told they'll investigate and call me back. Still no communication from them over the next 24hrs. Rang them back only to be told that my box had been damaged in transit and the driver thought it was better not to deliver it. That's fine with me but a simple phone call, text message or email to let me know what was going on seems to be a bit much to ask from them. I'm disappointed to say the least. I work when the shops are closed and I'm sleeping while they are open. To have everything here when I get up, instead of doing the mad dash at 9:45pm to the supermarket was supposed to be convenient, not more stressful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:37:49.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

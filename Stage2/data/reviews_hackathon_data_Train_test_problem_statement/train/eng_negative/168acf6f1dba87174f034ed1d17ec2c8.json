I called teleflora and explain what happen. They refused to refund or deliver correct flowers, but they offered me a 10% discount on future order !!!! I told them that was unacceptable, that I paid a lot of money for these flowers I even upgraded to the deluxe bouquet and vase , I told them I wanted a full refund or deliver the correct flowers to my wife. They gave me a 10% refund and said I could accept that , or nothing!!! They were very rude and uncaring. I feel like they ripped me off and there's nothing I can do about it", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T10:37:17.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

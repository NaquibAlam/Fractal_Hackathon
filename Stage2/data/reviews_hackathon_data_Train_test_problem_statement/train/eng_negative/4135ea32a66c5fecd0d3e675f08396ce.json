I resent this as for 15 hours they said they hadn't received it. I chased them by phone and email on several occasions. My account was suspended. No replies were received from PP. Totally ignorant. I have just received a reply were they stated they can see no wrong usage on the account and for me to contact the police. Also when I agree no action is needed they will unlock my account.\nI replied that I would not be using them any more.\nI believe their systems have been compromised.\nI also saw another account has complained about hacking.\nFrom mine and other complaints I suggest as many people as possible avoid Paddy Power at all costs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:54:43.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

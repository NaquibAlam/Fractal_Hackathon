Of course, the shirt has yet to ship and it's half way through the day on February 2nd. I ordered these in plenty of time for my family to have them for the superbowl... now only one person will have their shirt in time and the other will be left out. I tried contacting Fanatics for an answer & of course all I get back is a generic answer that doesn't satisfy my question. I paid full price for these items & gave this company plenty of time to fulfill my order in a timely manner. I am REALLY disappointed & I will not be ordering from this company again in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:46:07.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There is even a note saying 'if you are in between sizes, go wit the bigger and have it tailored for a perfect fit'. It didn't seem right to get a XXL just because I'm 44 inches in the hips. I though it'd be too big since I regularly wear 10-12\nThere were out of XL so I bought a L (I figuered fitted was better). When it arrived and Intied it on, it's HUGE besides it's a stretchy fabric. I called customer service to return but they're closed on the weekends so I went ahead and ordered another one because I need it for this week and there's no way it will look good if inches have to be taken in. An 'S' because they're out of M as well. Medium would be a regular fit because it's two inches smaller than what I have and Small will still fit because like I said, the fabric stretches. So I read the return policy and they will keep a 10% restocking fee plus $8 return shipping. And not even return money but give a store credit like it's my fault they're measurements are way off. They suggested an XXL but I'll be able to wear a S.\nI will not return the L one to get ridiculously low store credit because I won't be able to afford anything and I will not pay again for something that will not fit!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:29:12.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

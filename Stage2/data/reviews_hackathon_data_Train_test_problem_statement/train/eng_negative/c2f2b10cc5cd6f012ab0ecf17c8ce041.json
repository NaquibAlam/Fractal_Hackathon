Although better than Uber in some respects, Lyft is STILL a cynical and mostly terrible company for drivers. For example, the tipping policy hype conveniently leaves out that:\n- only ~60% of the riders tip (\"ridesharing\" is seen as a NON-premium service; making it more expensive by adding a tip is counterintuitive)\n- the average tip amount isn't even 10% (most waiters get 15%, and they don't burn their own resources, risk traffic, or have to sustain conversation to POTENTIALLY get it)\n- and WORST of all, Lyft likely only offers tipping as an incentive because they KNOW they can't compete with Uber's volume, and at the same time shifts that part of the compensation to the driver (try to get a tip when there are no rides...)\nThere are MANY other examples of awfulness by both companies, some of which have been highlighted in the reviews on this site and others.\nOkay, you say, you're a passenger and couldn't care less about the driver? Fair enough, but consider that MANY (I'd believe MOST) of the drivers are SEVERELY UNDERINSURED. This makes the ride MUCH more dangerous for everyone (there are REASONS why a cab ride is more expensive - insurance by cab companies is one of those reasons). Well...not actually \"everyone\" because ALL rideshare companies push AT LEAST some liability for an accident off to the \"independent contractor\", and DO NOT REGULARLY CHECK because there is NO VALUE to THEM to do so (what sense does it make to take its labor force off the road??).\nAs a passenger, why should you care? - if you're injured in an accident (likelier than a cab ride because the \"cabbies\" aren't likely to be professionals, as well as being distracted by the often-awful app), you're going to have a hard time collecting damages because:\n- MOST drivers aren't wealthy, and, again, aren't well-paid (the claim of \"Up to $35/hour plus tips\" by Lyft is cynical, as it is rarely achievable, and not-at-all sustainable...but I digress)\n- MOST insurance companies aren't going to pay out on personal policies when the insured driver is working at the time of the accident\n- Lyft specifically limits its exposure, despite the FACT that it would be directly benefitting from the work-product of the driver at the time of the accident (the reason why Lyft prefers \"independent contractors\"). I did mention cynicism, right?\nOkay, you say, you don't use rideshare service anyway, so you're immune? Try again; rideshare companies are effectively INCENTIVIZING people to become (distracted) UNINSURED MOTORISTS...so if YOU drive, you'd be unwise not to include uninsured motorist insurance coverage on your vehicle. And be prepared to pay an increasingly artificially high price for it, thanks in part to these companies.\nThese problems are only the tip of the iceberg...\nAlthough I never drove for Juno (and wouldn't drive or use a rideshare service ever again knowing what I know now), it seems to have the potential to inject some MUCH NEEDED ethics into this scumbag business. Shame on BOTH Lyft AND Uber.\nOh, and I was a 4.94-rated driver and accident-free with over 1,200 rides when I stopped driving for Lyft in November 2016...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:12:33.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

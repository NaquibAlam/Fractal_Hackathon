I received my glasses in less than two weeks. The problem I experienced was with my prescription, when I placed my order I emailed them my prescription from my recent Doctor's Visit. What I received was my left eye lens with no prescription. I was very disappointed that they had my prescription and they could not get it right the first time. When I emailed them with my problem, they emailed me back with a picture of my prescription stating that they followed my prescription. My prescription clearly stated to balance both my lenses so I am not sure how they could screw they up. I had to send it back to them and PAY FOR RETURN SHIPPING. And then they charged me another $25.80 to complete my glasses and send them back to me. I felt that they took no responsibility for the screw up and the apology was generic and not heartfelt. Bottom line; great price, great workmanship, got my glasses fast. But customer service was very poor otherwise I would have given them a 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T20:36:52.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

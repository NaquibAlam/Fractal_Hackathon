It all seemed to go through until i received a call the following morning to inform me verbally, that only the Deluxe pool access room in the Graceland wing (Which is considerably older) not the Sunset wing was available. I was told that i was required to book it on line and that she was unable to make the booking, I immediately booked the room that once again I was told verbally was available, it all went through yet again, until I received an email an hour later, thats right ONE HOUR LATER!! stating that they had attempted to call me... Funny, as I didn't have a missed call... The email informed me that they were sorry this room was sold out, alternatively they have a POOL VIEW room available, If I book this room tomorrow morning they could have me in a broom closet!\nMy mother was booked into a deluxe room... I have since cancelled her room with the hotel and its cost me over $400.\nIf you don't have the software to show potential holidayers that your rooms are not available, you have no right claiming that you are experts at anything!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T05:00:11.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

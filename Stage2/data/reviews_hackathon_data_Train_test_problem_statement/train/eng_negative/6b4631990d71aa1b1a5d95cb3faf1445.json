In that order, I paid for rapid shipping. Following up on the transit progress via Eeurparts' online system, the system indicated that my order was shipped on Monday, February 27th. I telephonically contacted Eeuroparts customer service on Tuesday evening, February 28th inquiring as the the where-abouts of my order. The Customer Service representative indicated that the shipping company handling my order was changed from Fed-Ex to USPS and that no further info was available. She indicated that she would research and advise me within the hour. The Eeuroparts representative did not return my call, so I called again to understand if my order would be filled/sent ... she could not provide any additional information. It's now Wednesday afternoon, March 1st. Telephoned Eeuroparts and spoke (again) to customer representative. He indicated that he would have the premium shipping costs refunded to me, but again, could not provide more specific information as to why my order, sitting at a distribution point approximately 23 miles away at 9 AM this morning, is not/has not been delivered ... and that no additional tracking update is available. As I am a long time , customer (repeat buyer) with this company, I would have expected, at the very least, that this organization would attempt to rectify their short comings ... perhaps in the form of a a discount voucher good toward a future order. Well, it's Wednesday nite as I complete this survey ... and still this order has not been received (keeping my 'fingers crossed' to receive this order on Thursday). To the new owners of Eeuroparts: with customer service and follow-up like this, I sincerely wonder how long you will remain in business. I wish you success in resolution of these shortfalls to make my future business experiences with your company, more pleasurable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:02:47.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

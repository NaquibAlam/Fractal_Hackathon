Then when I amended the review you wrote to tell me it had been published. Then you emailed again to say you had pulled it again over something you didnot point out in your first email, even though I did not change the point you found fault with the second time around. So I amended it a second time. Then you wrote to say you had published the review, BUT YOU HAVENT REMOVED THE MESSAGE THAT SAYS 'Trustpilot reported this review. It was amended so why leave that notice against it? Why the dishonesty?\nI believe in letting my yes mean yes and my no mean no. Shame you are not so honest. Maybe you should amend your name to pilot. Cos we clearly cant trust you!!! Seems you like to run with the hounds and hunt with the hares boys, how sad!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T15:22:07.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

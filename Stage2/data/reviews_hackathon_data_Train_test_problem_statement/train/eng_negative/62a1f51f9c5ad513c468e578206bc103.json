When I purchased the tickets and put my card info in I received a receipt showing me the date,time and total purchase price. And at the bottom of the page it says that I will get a email with the tickets and to print them out to take with us by the 2nd. On the 3rd I still didn't get one so I called and was on hold for at least 40 mins just to find out that my ticket purchase was rejected cause I put to many letters in my email address so they couldn't send me the tickets. But my thing is I seen where I screwed up the email address but my phone number was correct on the paper. We bought those tickets a good 2 weeks in advance so why didn't I get a phone call? Very upset about it. They should have it where you have to confirm your email twice before submitting the card or at least try to call you if there's a problem. Hence the reason it ask for your number.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:28:08.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Me and my fiancé ordered furniture at the San Angelo location back in December. We bought a bedroom set, and our sales guy was super awesome. We live in Dallas (just visiting in San Angelo) so we had our furniture sent to the Lewisville location. We scheduled a delivery date for 02/01/17. About a week before, we decided to go up to the store to look at a dining room table. Home Zone had no record of our delivery date nor our furniture. Luckily, we had our receipts so they honored that. However, they did not have that date available for delivery so told us we had to pick it up at the Euless location. Which was about an hour from us. I WAS SO OUTRAGED. The customer service sucked and the entire business is so unorganized. On they day of pickup, we called in the morning and they told us the truck would be there that afternoon but they could not confirm if our furniture would be on the truck or not! Are you kidding me?! The sales rep said she would call us around 2. Five o'clock comes around, still no call. So my fiancé calls, and they said our furniture was there but forgot to call us. So we had to haul across town, in the middle of traffic. It was a nightmare. Once we got it home, it was difficult to set up. The furniture is nice, but I can tel the quality sucks.\nDon't buy from Homezone. Go somewhere else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:00:31.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

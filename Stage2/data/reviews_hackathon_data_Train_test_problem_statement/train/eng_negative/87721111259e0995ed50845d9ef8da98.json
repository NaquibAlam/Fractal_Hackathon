As we did not purchase any additional insurance they charged us the excess. The exemption to normal situation was, that they actually charged it, a 1100 euro sum, it wasn't just a reservation. Now, a month and a half later the money has not returned into our account, even though the car was returned in good condition and return was signed off by the company.\nThey refuse to reply emails and by phone they always give the same answer; to send them our detail by mail and the financial dep. will take care of the rest. Nothing happens. The HQ in Spain is not helping either, in their system our deposit has been released. We are not giving up yet and are tryiong to sort the thing out with the Cyprus office.\nThe point is, if you travel to Cyprus or anywhere else and happen to find a good car rental under the name of Goldcar, please use some consideration, you might not get your money back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:53:30.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

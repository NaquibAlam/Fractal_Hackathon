I will not be using them again.\nIn the past I have always had zero excess through them. Hand in keys and walk away. The last two occasions I have not, as I had a UK excess policy. On the first rental there was hardly anybody at the check in desk. I was told it was OK to leave the car without it being inspected which I did. I then got a bill for body damage which I know was not caused by me. In the end the credit card company cancelled Goldcars charge.\nThe second rental I took the car back and this time insisted on a signature. I would describe it as chaotic. The staff were not sufficiently well organised to understand that some of those waiting like me wanted an inspection and signature. Many wanting a signature left. I got my inspection and signature after 35 minutes. The remote worked but they found the lock itself did not. 250 euro bill which I am getting back from my insurer.\nIf you take out your own excess really really check the car before you take it and photograph it and be prepared to be messed about and delayed upon return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T15:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:25:27.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

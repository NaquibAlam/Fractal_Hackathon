Unfortunately that's where the good experience ended. After I received the wrong colour dining table in December I was assured that they could exchange as long as I kept the table in the original packaging. Unfortunately, this turned out to be false. In fact, after emailing them on the 4th of January to set up the exchange they did not respond for over 3 weeks. All the while I am waiting with no kitchen table to eat on and a massive box in my kitchen. After 4 or 5 emails with no response and exactly 23 days later a representative contacts me and explains that they are looking into the matter. Another week and a few more emails later and I am informed that due to \"the 'recent' acquisition of Milan Direct unfortunately we cannot process an exchange\" Recent?? Milan Direct was bought by Temple and Webster in 2015!\nAs of today, 6th of February 2017 have been told that I will have to wait for the table to get picked up, they will take back to their warehouse, refund the money into my account and I will have to reorder another table from their website.. back to where I started in November. Who knows. if I'm lucky I might have my table by Christmas 2018!\nThis is the second time this has happened in as many deliveries. Judging from their plummeting share price I can only imagine It's not the first time! I would strongly recommend going elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:08:29.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

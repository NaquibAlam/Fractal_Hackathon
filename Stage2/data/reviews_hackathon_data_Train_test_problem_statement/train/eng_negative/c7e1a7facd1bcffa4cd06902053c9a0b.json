I was told both were in stock, and would be shipped to my home. Then, I got an email saying only one of the shirts was in stock. When I told the rep I didn't want another color, just apply the $20 coupon to the one shirt they DID have in stock, they refused to do so, and only applied $10 or half, because I only got half my order. Is it MY fault you went out of stock on an item? Why should I lose 1/2 the value of my coupon because you screwed up?\nIn response to DXL's response, NO, it did not rectify my problem to force me to buy another shirt in a color I did not want, or lose half my coupon. I asked them to apply the full $20 coupon to the one shirt that DID ship, since I did not want another shirt in a color I didn't like, but they wouldn't do that, so I was forced to buy another item in order to keep my full coupon value. That's fraud, and I hope you made a lot on the extra shirt, because you lost me as a life-long customer, so I hope that R.O.I. is worth it for you.\nTo the second response from DXL, I did NOT get an email from you.

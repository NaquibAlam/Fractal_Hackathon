I can say now I'm happy they didn't give me one because I don't want to be stuck with a loan like that or dealing with this company. I spoke with a woman named Jill, if I am remembering her name correctly, we spoke for almost 30 minutes going through all of my info and all seemed fine she said come in and it will take only a couple of minutes. I went into the office and was there for an hour. Jill was late for work so they said start with another gentleman and she will help when she arrives. 3 offices and 5 people late I walked out with no loan. There offices are weird, all open, no privacy, they don't know what's going on, at one point one of the guys who dealt with the insurance was drilling me about my company because it is similar work (insurance) and he said he was looking for something new as this place was \"cheap\" as he said. If you can help it please don't use a company like this or this one! At the end of the day the hassle you will get into paying off a very high interest loan that you'll end up paying back two or three times is not worth it. Stay away from this company.\nI am no scorned due to not getting a loan. I choose to walk out with no loan. They tried to tell me my car was worth very little (they will repossess and sell your car if your payments are late). I have since sold the car and made 6X what they said my car was worth. Please stay away from this company. Don't let there 15-20 speech about how bad all the other loan companies are scare you into them... remember they are one of those loan companies they just don't include their own name in the speech.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:11:11.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

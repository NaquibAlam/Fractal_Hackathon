I asked them several times if they are sure that the person would get the flowers today. I was told NO PROBLEM, then today at 5:10 the person that was to get the flowers order, knew NOTHING about them. When I checked via status all it said is Driver has not updated. I then called the 800 number gave my order number told them what did not happen which was no delivery of flowers and now I want my order canceled and money back. I was told that they had to talk to the local person but that they were already closed and they too show no update from Driver. Meaning also that it confirmed no delivery was made so give me my money back. They said no we have to talk to them first, it does not matter the person did not get the flowers, they broke their end of the agreement. By chance I order other set of flowers from another company in another town and I had no problem with them. I even ordered those flower MUCH later but they still delivered the product. So I will NEVER use this Avas Flowers again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:19:55.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

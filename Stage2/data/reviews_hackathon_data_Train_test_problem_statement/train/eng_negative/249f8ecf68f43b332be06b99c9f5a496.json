But even if you have worked hard to accumulate points and status, your ability to use those hard earned points is limited. Firstly, the real international reward seats are extraordinarily limited and unless you book well in advance (I'm talking 6 months), you will not find anything close to adequate. Then if you manage to score it, you then have to pay 'fees & charges' in cash that can be quite a lump. For example, for 2 business class tickets Mel-Bali with Jetstar, you'll pay about $950 in fees & charges. If you want to negate this with points, then the amount of points required can be more than the points you used to get the tickets in the first place.\nHence, lesson here is they'll gouge you one way or another and QF does not care whether you go elsewhere or not because they pretty much are a monopoly player in Australia.\nThis doesn't happen with Virgin FF rewards. Even when you're charged some fees & charges, they are very small (usually less than $100). If Virgin flew to more destinations more frequently so that business travellers had real choice, I would dump QF altogether rather than sharing my business between them like I have to now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:18:32.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

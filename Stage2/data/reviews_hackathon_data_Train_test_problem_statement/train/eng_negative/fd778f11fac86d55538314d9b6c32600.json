Then 1200 deposit. We took pictures scratches what where in that car we we got it. Scratches were also marked in that paper we got from office. We dropped car at 05.00 am. and office was closed, so key to the box, no staff there. After day they sent picture of scratch what already was in the car we got it! And some other picture which one is so unclear, just dusty car, you can see nothing in pictures, even you look in photoshop. Marked scratch has marked in the paper and and shows photoes, which we took when we got the car. In photoes are date and time. Now they reduce 200€ from deposit. Car was without fail in same condition when we left it when we got it! I´m very disappointed to Goldcar and for that you have solve this kind of thing absolutely without reason.\nSo Victoria R, how can I reach you? I have sent several messages to you, but nobody answers! I can sent also these attachment-pictures which proves that scratches were there already, before we got car.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:19:43.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

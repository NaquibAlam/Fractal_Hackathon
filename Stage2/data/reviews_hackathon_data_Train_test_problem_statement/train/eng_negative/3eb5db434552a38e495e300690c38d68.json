They charged me $56 including fees initially. Had to call them and was met with some guy in a home office with the worst phone connection ever. He spent 10 minutes trying to convince me to let him replace the code, after I had repeatedly told him that I wanted a refund. Finally, he honored their guarantee, and refunded my purchase through PayPal. I would NOT TRUST THIS SITE.

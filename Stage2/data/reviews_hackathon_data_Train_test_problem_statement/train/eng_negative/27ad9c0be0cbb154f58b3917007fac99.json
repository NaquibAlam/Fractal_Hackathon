I have been buying tickets for years, but sadly duped by sharp practice and this is the intention of the company. As mentioned before a price is displayed on top of the page including all taxes etc. I know that paying by credit card there are additional costs so paid by visa debt.Not a problem for this company you are going to have an additional charge whatever card you produce.\nAfter the transact the price was changed at the top of the page ,but you are not advised of any price change only the screen at top of the page which by chance you can't see and just to put the boot in we are now in Euros as opposed to British pound.\nOk I was duped, this is the first time in probably 80 typical transactions,so I supposed I was too relaxed in trusting the honesty of this company.\nIf I get a really bored will write to my European MP about this sharp oblique practice\nPlease note that this is not the first time somebody has written about this problem and have they do any thing about it?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:05:06.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

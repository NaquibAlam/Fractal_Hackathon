I was connected to an operator right away but was consistently given wrong information when I tried to reschedule. I was told that I would have to pay $120 additional for rebooking the flight for a 12 hour earlier time slot but the receipt when I did it was for $186. I asked about the original amount I had paid for the later time slot and was told that I had to pay that too. None of these charges came through correctly on my credit card, the $186 was the total, including what I had already paid. I ended up cancelling the flight and booking through another service for $58, total.

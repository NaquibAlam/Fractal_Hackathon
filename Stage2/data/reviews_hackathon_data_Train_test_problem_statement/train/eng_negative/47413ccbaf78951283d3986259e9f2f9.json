Cost you get Quote: d will not be the cost you pay! Went with Servicing Stop because I thought I was getting a good deal. Booked what I thought was a 'Full Servce' for a Range Race Rover only to find out once the vehicle was in the garage that a lot more other work would be required....cost went up 150%. If you are expecting a service that will not impact on your warranty then you need to make sure you know what you are getting....I worked after today that it would have been cheaper to go direct to my local Range Rover specialist! Problem is you don't find these things out until after your car has been collected and with the garage....hard to say no without having more hassle getting it to another garage and paying more labour costs....have you over a barrel a bit!\n2. Bit of a lottery where your car goes....Once booked you get an email back telling you which 'Servicing Stop' garage your car will be going to....great, but when you Google to check reviews out....garage does not exist....that because it's not theirs but an independent. Yes if lucky the address will match one, but if several on the same street then a bit of a lottery. Luckily for me I couldn't fault the one used but I can see other people's point....quality could be hit and miss.\n3. Payment - you pay to get the car released and invoice only shows basics...which is a fair one but when the invoice shows all of your 'Quote: d' costs just on labour and a '0' against expected parts to be fitted, you then need to waste time calling to make sure these have been done...clearly if a seasoned user then this will not be an issue. In addition watch out for the £25 off your next service, easily missed when paying, until you get an email thanking you for it. I would prefer this offered after I had the car back....if I was happy then would certainly take it up...but in my case had to ask for it back before I even got the car back....again having to ring them.\n4. Great reviews on their site That's because you have to make them before paying, seeing invoice and getting car back! What! Surely like every other service provider on the planet you would ask for this after you are sure you are happy with everything....in this case when you get your car back....Smoke and Mirrors! Hence using this site for a post service review.\n5. Customer Service....well I'm still awaiting a call back ref some work I asked to be carried out....despite having the car back 3 hours also very easy to get my £25 back so I assume this is a common ask! Hate to think if I had to ask something technical....but what do you expect from a 'Middleman Company'.\n6. Would have been 1 Star, but at least the garage was great so an extra 1 for you Servicing Stop, but don't expect any return business...Bye!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:17:57.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

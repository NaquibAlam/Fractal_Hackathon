I have booked my flight in my maiden surname by mistake. My passport is in my married surname. When I tried to phone Bravofly to change the name on my booking to my married surname (at a cost of EUR6.10) I was advised that I would receive an email with the costs to change the name within 24 hours as they don't know. I phoned again the next day (at a further cost of EUR6.10) only to be told that I would receive the information via phone within 7 days. Still, nothing! I phoned again 7 days later (at a further cost of EUR6.10) only to be told that the airline has not yet responded and I should phone back again in another 7 days' time. Apparently because my flights are only for May 2017 the airline is in no rush to assist me. But if I phone the airline directly they will be able to assist IMMEDIATELY. However, they demand that I work through Bravofly. This whole experience has left me angry and frustrated! How many times do I have to phone at a cost of EUR6.10 per call, before this issue is resolved? Taking money for NOTHING looks like FRAUD to me! I am about to report this company on every website and every platform and with every authority out there until I get the results I am entitled to!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:50:30.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

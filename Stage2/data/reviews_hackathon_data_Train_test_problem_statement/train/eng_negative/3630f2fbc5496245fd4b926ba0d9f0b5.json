And that's because their customer support is poor.\nYes, most of us have experienced poor customer service - it is one of the hazards of life.\nWhen everything works, OK. But when you need a helping hand quickly, it is not OK.\nI locked myself out of my ZOHO account after a password change. Forcing me to setup a free GMail account so I could contact ZOHO support.\nHowever, I have no way of knowing whether they have received my request for assistance or not - certainly my Gmail Inbox is empty.\nI gather that they do not work at weekends. And so I have to wait until Monday for a response.\nMike.\n7th March 2017\nThe following is an update to my ZOHO review.\nZOHO support have now reset my Password and I have sucessfully logged into my account.\nIt has taken 4 days for them just to do this - well in fairness - one and a half business days. They do not support their clients during weekends.\nIf I was a business user, then its safe to say I could very well be in a pickle by now.\nHowever, I am only a home user; but it is no less crucial that I have not just a robust Email service, but the confidence in its customer support too.\nThis is a shame, because, clearly ZOHO and all their bundled office applications are very fine.\nBut poor customer support might just be their Achilles Heel, and I am not sure whether I will want to stay with them if they don't provide a faster support system and at the weekends too.\nEven more vital it surely must be for business customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T13:01:14.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

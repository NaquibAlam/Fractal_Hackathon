When I saw what she received I got really upset. She got a cheap vase and a printed piece of a paper in the envelope. The worst was yet to come. Contacted support and told the what was going on. Then a guy calls from Spain to my girlfriend being being very rude asking about if what she got and so on. He didn't even bother to call me, I ordered, not her. I send another message to the support and didn't hear anything from them. Got a email today saying my ticket is closed and they are not going to do anything about it. I'm very disappointed at this company and would never recommend anyone to hire them when they treat their costumers like this. :(", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:47:47.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

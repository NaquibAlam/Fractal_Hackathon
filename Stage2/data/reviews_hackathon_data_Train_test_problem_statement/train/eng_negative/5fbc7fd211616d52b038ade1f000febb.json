For example the Arduino GSM shield I ordered. 3 weeks after my order they send me a mail to say it's out of stock. When I went to the product page, it said that the product was in stock. So I told the customer care on the other side that it shows that it's still in stock but (s)he didn't respond to my remark and said it was out of stock and always asked if I wanted a refund. After 4 days of e-mailing back and forth with screenshots and telling them that they should remove the \"in stock\" from their website or send me the product, they told me they would send the products and asked me to give them good reviews. 2 weeks later, not really unexpected, I got an e-mail that my order was cancelled and I would get a refund. Banggood is deceiving its clients.\nInstead of 1 package, everything seperate.\nI created my order in December 2016 which was a selection of different products. Despite the appearance, Banggood is an in between party that will collect orders and dispatch it to different Chinese companies. Although I don't have a problem with this concept, they should at least offer the possibility to send everything in one package. Banggood doesn't allow that so I received 6 different packages all at different dates. Since I work during the day, I had to go to the post office 6 different time instead of once. What a waste of time!\nLong delivery time.\nIt took about 6 weeks to receive all my products which is a long time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T12:05:07.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

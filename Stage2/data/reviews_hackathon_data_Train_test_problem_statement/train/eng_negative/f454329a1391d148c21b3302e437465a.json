In 2016, I was receiving catalogs saying I could order up to $700 and pay $35 a month. I made an order for $99 and it was fulfilled.\nA couple weeks later I tried to make another order for some people I'd decided to buy Christmas gifts for. The order was for $75.\nI thought the gifts had been sent. I was waiting to hear from the people.\nAnd I got a letter mailed to me from Figis saying that my credit report said that I had requested notification before ordering things on credit.\nCalled Figis and spoke with them and they said they had everything cleared up and were going to send the gifts.\nI waited a couple more weeks and still no gift.\nI got another letter in the mail (in spite of the fact that they had both my phone number and my email address) saying that they had decided not to fulfill my order because of questions of fraud?! And also it said both that I had too many revolving accounts and not enough revolving accounts. Hmm.\nSo at Christmas time, they don't send out things I ordered, and wait for weeks to inform me of this fact by letter.\nI told them never to send me another catalog from ANY of their affiliates because, why would I ever believe their offer of credit again?!\nIt's insane. And they keep sending me their stupid catalogs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:17:41.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

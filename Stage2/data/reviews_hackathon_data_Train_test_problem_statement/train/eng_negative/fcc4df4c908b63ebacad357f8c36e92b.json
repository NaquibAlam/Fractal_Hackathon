I paid upfront for the booking, but unfortunately missed my flight and arrived 7 hours after the pickup time, but on the same day and I was refused my car I had paid for upfront with insurance for 4 days! Although knowing there were many cars still available in the parking lot the staff we rude and unhelpful and refused me a car. I understand this is a business, but I believe a company like this should have a duty of care to their customers, knowing they are in a foreign country... Rather then leaving a woman travelling on her own stranded in the airport late at night.\nI found this whole expierence very nerve wrecking and it caused me great upset and huge disappointment in Gold Car and complete disgust in the behaviour of their staff!!!!\nMy recommendation is.... DO NOT BOOK WITH GOLD CAR!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T19:19:30.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

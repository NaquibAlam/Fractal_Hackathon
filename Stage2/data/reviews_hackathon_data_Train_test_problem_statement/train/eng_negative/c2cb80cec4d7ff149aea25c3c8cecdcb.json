The first shipment was unacceptable due to the condition of shock inside the shipping box. Packages were sun faded and the cardboard box was disintegrated. Outside shipment box was not damaged in any way. I contacted the company and received apologies with a new shipment of pool shock. The second shipment was identical to the first in the lack of quality and damaged goods. The exterior shipping box was in great shape. The person that pulled these orders intentionally put faded bags of pool shock with disintegrated cardboard packaging in the shipping box. I contacted customer service in regards to the second shipment and have not received a reply in eleven days time. I sent a video of me opening the second shipment and photos of both shipments. My only comment to customer service after the second botched delivery was that I was speechless!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T15:57:33.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

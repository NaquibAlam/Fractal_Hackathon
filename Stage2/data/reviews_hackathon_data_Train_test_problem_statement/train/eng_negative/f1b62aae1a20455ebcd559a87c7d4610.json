August 3 2016 To February 17,2017 will be my round trip ticket! I called him to say to rescheduled my flight again but he was not available so Evander(another agent from ASAP Ticket service) answered my call. Since Achilles is not available at that time So I Talked to Evander then I said to him he could use my ticket protection plan for a re book because Achilles said to me that I could use my ticket protection without penalty fee but Evander said I couldn't use it. It's not covered I have to pay $300 united airlines administrative exchange penalty $250 ITN Processing fee $356.40 fare difference a total of $656.40\nhe also said that I have to complete the form that he sent to me in next 2 hours and the seats are not guaranteed until the seats are booked. I was surprised and I've done nothing but pay for them to be rebook my flight because to not lose the purchased round trip ticket and ticket protection plan but I mistakenly thought! When I call them again to adjust the date of my return they told me that I had to pay $8,500 plus. No one said to me that my ticket protection plan was null and no one issue me a charge break down. It's more a scam! I am extremely unhappy with their agents and services!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:34:33.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

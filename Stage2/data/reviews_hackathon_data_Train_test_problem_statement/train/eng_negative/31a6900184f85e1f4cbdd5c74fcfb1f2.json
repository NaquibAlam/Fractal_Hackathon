They are usually very rude and unwilling to help you. In addition no matter how good you are with your account, paying payments always on time and paying more than your minimum payment it is like near impossible to get a credit increase and if you do get a credit increase its tiny and not enough to be able to buy the over priced items your wanting. I have a fingerhut account and they are much more easier to work with if you have a problem with your order. Fingerhut customer service is much more friendlier and they go out of there way to help you. In addition much easier to get credit increases with Fingerhut. Plus fingerhut offers more promo codes than gettington. Over all gettington is NOT a great company at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:24:50.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

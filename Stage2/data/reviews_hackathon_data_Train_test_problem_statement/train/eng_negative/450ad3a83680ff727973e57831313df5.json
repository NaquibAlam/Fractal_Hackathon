NEVER AGAIN! I used them to book a hotel for someone else as a present.. It let me book & pay upfront. Yet when they arrived at their hotel they had to pay for the room aswel!! I called booking who told me the hotel had refunded me, yet when i checked they had only refunded half! The worst part is my guests had to pay for their own present! So out of order booking.com! When I spoke to booking.com & told them that I had only been refunded half the woman on the phone 'julinter' told me I had been refunded the full amount, she was very patronising which made me just want to speak to a manager she refused & told me she was going to put the phone down on me. And did! So I called back (almost in tears) asking to talk to a manager about what had just happened on the previous call.. She refused also & put the phone down! I will never use this company again, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! I'm so disappointed in how they treat their customers! It's disgusting!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:31:08.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

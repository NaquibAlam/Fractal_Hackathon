The model was probably a foot taller than I was. But the top was too big, the sleeves were too loose. The bottom looks excellent on my body. The mesh is hideous! I feel like it doesn't compliment my upper half at all. I thought there would be breast cups, but the Breast portion is sewn in. It's so weird on my body that it doesn't even look like a two piece. It looks like a one piece with a sliver of skin between the top and bottom of it. It's pretty, but not worth $350 dollars from your bank account. The good thing about the dress is that the sleeves aren't itchy at all, like most would think.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:56:46.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

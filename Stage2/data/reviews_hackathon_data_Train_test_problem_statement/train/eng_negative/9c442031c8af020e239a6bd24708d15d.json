The website said it had the items I requested in stock, then I was notified to say one was out of stock (swimsuit). I then changed cup size of the swimsuit I ordered as I was told by customer service that the next one was in stock. I was again notified to say that was out of stock and couldn't be reordered from the supplier. Although the web page continued to say it was in stock. So a refund for this item was to be issued only the whole original amount was refunded instead of that one item. I had to organise payment again for the single item I was waiting for, a sports bra. After 3 weeks of waiting and several messages to customer service I was told that the sports bra, which was in stock when I originally ordered it, was now out of stock. I was then told I had to wait another week before it would arrive at Zodee for dispatch as someone forgot to order it in the order that was placed the day before. Finally the bra arrived 2 days later and wasn't missing off the previous days order like I had been told. I am very frustrated with the service I received as a result of some obvious miscommunication in the warehouse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:57:04.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

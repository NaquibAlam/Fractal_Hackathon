Myers Beach to pick up the keys to the condo we rented one year earlier, they weren't there! This was at 9:30 p.m. with a car full of groceries. We called VRP's emergency number and were told that property was no longer their's and they \"according to our contract\" have the right to move us to different lodging. So that's what they did. Two hours later we were at a less desirable unit and location then what we rented. Vacation's are supposed to be a time to get away from stress for a while and relax. This caused A lot of stress for my husband and I. The next day we moved again into the unit we wanted, but we lost a day of our vacation and had to dispose of groceries. They said they would make it right, but so far, after emailing, stopping into the office twice and calling customer service twice, not a word. Customer service is poor. I hope this doesn't happen to youl", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T13:32:43.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Which clearly showed we are not in the wrong.\nNow PayPal none the less ask the buyer to return the item, but stop short of saying the buyer is in the right. Instead informing me that they have chosen to ask the buyer to exercise there returns under UK law (aka cooling off period).\nI say fair enough as they are paying returns, but I do expect to have at least 12 to 48 hours to at least collect the item from the drop off point and also inspect it to make sure it is as was sent out i.e. complete, undamaged.\nThey originally gave the buyer 10 days to return it. However the buyer does not do so, and I phone them on the 10th day saying nothing has been received and neither has the tracking been provided. How am I supposed to conduct business as I can resell the item until it is back in a fair and reasonable time frame. They now try and tell me they are giving the buyer more time and in fact they dont consider it have to be returned simply that some kind of valid tracking is provided by the 10th day. And according to there records the buyer just provided it today. Even thought they have not actually posted it.\nSo I have to wait a further week, and when it arrives PayPal immediately refunds the buyer as soon as the tracking shows it as arrived. There by not only not giving us any chance to pick up the item from the collection point let alone actually inspect the item.\nWe contact them and they fob us off telling us thats there policy. And tell us that if there is a problem then appeal it. After much arguing and debate they wont help, so we are not happy at all but consider it a learning lesson, as long as the item is ok.\nHowever upon inspection we find the item is damaged and altered. So we contact PayPal again and ask them now what. Considering they have given the money back already without gving us any opportunity, while the buyer was actually given more time than was originally generously granted to them.\nThey inform us we need to get third party written evidence and if that is provided then there is no problem we will win and be re-imbursed.\nWe cite the concern that we will have to waste time and also money in obtaining the third party document, and so want assurance that this is the case, as otherwise we could be further out of pocket. They assure us this would not be the case, as long as we get the evidence.\nWe do this and provide well within the time frame, and even though we do indeed win the case. They dont re-imburse us, but instead all they do is give us this message :\n\"Please contact the buyer to have the refund issued from your account returned to you\"\nSo basically no only did there direct actions and also advice have put me in a state of loss, without re-course. And they have also mislead me into believe I would be reimbursed and NOT in any financial loss, after I would win the case.\nTHIS is apparently what they call Seller Protection. In basic terms it is worth ZERO. As the adage goes, not even worth the paper it is written on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:23:00.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

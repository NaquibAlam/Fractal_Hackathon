When looking at the paperwork I received, a queen was what was ordered for my long bed. I drive to Gardner White to get a king pad and when I explained the situation, the woman just stared at me for a minute and then said we don't have those here. I can mail you one and you can receive it in 3-5 days. I explained that Lynne's was delivered and it was a real inconvenience for me to wait after spending $1200. After getting frustrated, I just asked that my money be refunded for the mattress pad. I was told that it would void any warranty on he bed, which I was fine with...I just wanted out of there. When the young man that was now helping me told the manager that, he repeated the same thing to me about the warranty and I told him I understood. Then they both walked away and I stood there for about 5 minutes without any idea what was going on. When the guy came back that was helping me he said didn't the other guy help you (the manager) and I said no. As he looked for the manager, he was no where to be found. Obviously he didn't want to deal with me. When he finally found him, I was then told that I could get one delivered that day from a delivery truck but it could be anytime from then until 11 pm that might. Not an option for me as I had already waited half of my Sunday at home for my mattress delivery. Then they said they had a cover, it had been returned by another customer because it had been cut by the driver but it had never been used or in a bed...I could take that one and they would get one in the mail for me ASAP. I agreed to this. I got it home and took it out of the packages and it reeked of smoke and marijuana. Needless to say, I did not put this on my new bed. It's unfortunate because I am getting ready to furnish a basement and a living room and opened the line of credit ther for this purpose. Unfortunately, I will not be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:52:11.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

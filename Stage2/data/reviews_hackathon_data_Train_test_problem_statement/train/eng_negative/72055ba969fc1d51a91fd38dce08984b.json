I realised that the course itself wasn't exactly advanced, but I was under the impression the course included all 3 ACA Adobe Certified exams included in the price. I asked 3 times during the phone call to confirm that this course included both Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. I was told after asking three times that yes these were all included. So I paid the £305.\nTurns out none of the exams were included in the deal, you have to individually pay for them yourself, so I cancelled the course within an hour of paying. And Instead of receiving a refund within 3-5 working days, I had to wait for weeks, send multiple emails and file a dispute with my bank. Eventually I got my money back. Avoid like the plague. They wasted a month of my time for no reason. Absolute bunch of jokers. Sales people, and bad ones at that. Good luck if something goes wrong with your course. If it does, you will NOT be able to contact them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:47:56.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The purchase was sent by Purolator, tracking number 330964321153. It was the first time anyone sent me anything by Purolator.\nOn February 07, Purolator’s website promised delivery of the package that day. At 2:51 p.m., the website announced, ‘Delayed in transit’ and that they will make another attempt the next day. It is important to note that I received a FedEx delivery that day; Purolator cannot site inclement weather as an excuse.\nOn February 08, Purolator’s website said the parcel was on the delivery track and that it was on its way. At 2:39 p.m., the website declared, ‘Delayed in transit’ and that they will make another attempt the next day. (February 08 was a beautiful day.)\nOn February 09 (today), the website once again said, ‘Delayed in transit’ and that they will make another attempt the next day. (Does this begin to sound like the movie ‘The Groundhog Day’?) Incidentally, February 09 was a mild and sunny day in Calgary, with no snowfall in sight.\nIn summary, Purolator is a third world company operating in the first world, and I don’t know why an established business like Best Buy would deal with this carrier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:02:03.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

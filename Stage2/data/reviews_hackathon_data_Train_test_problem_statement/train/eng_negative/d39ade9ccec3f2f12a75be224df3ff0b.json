I sent the video as asked. I had no follow up From Personal Comfort.\nAfter several days I called again, and was told that the person I originally talked to would call me back in like 15 minutes. Again Never got a call.\nNow I will be calling a 3rd time.\nFurthermore the bed itself has been very hard to adjust. Much more difficult than the sleep number that we tested in the showroom. And the pump is really noisy. Don't run it at night or you will wake up your spouse!\nThe A6 bed which was recommended is not plush at all. The same customer service rep offered to upgrade us to the A8. But again it as been a couple weeks and we have not seen any email or received anything making good on that promise.

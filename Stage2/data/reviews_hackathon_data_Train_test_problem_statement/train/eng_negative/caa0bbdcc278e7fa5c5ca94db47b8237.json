For one, the prices aren't even that cheap compared to other retailers, including with the discount. For another the price cannot be justified as the quality is appalling. The first time I worked out the thread on the seams of the leggings started to fall apart. This was the first strike against the company.\nThe second strike was that I cant cancel my account? I cant email, I have to phone them which costs money. As far as I know, making a customer pay to cancel an account is an illegal act. Strike 2.\nI was asked to send a letter to them to cancel my account instead which I did. I didnt get an email on the 1st of Feb telling me that I needed to skip this month, and thus I thought, yay finally, my account was cancelled. Today, on the 10th I was charged Â£44. Not only was I not forewarned this month, as for the past year I have in fact skipped the month the not pay the costs. I was also charged 4 days after Fabletics states in their terms and conditions that they require the payment. This is an appalling way to get money off customers, especially since I had done what they asked me to cancel my account.\nI have emailed them now, and brought it up with Paypal that this charge was unauthorised. I am surprised the illegal actions (such as not having an easily accessible cancellation service) has not been brought up in a court.\nWill not shop with them again, or their sister company JustFab. Will also do all I can to get refunded and get my account cancelled asap. They are a disgrace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T21:15:54.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

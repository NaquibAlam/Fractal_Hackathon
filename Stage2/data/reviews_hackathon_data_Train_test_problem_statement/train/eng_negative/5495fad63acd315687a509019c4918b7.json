The worse thing is when I call the company's line, the travel agent refused to cancel it and gave me the hard time said ' Manulife Insurence is NOT cancelable'. Because I insisted to cancel it and explaned that I was de-selected that when I operating on line, there is no reason to force me pay it if I don't need. After the travel agent checked with someone for couple minutes that she was permite to cancel the insurence and refund the money to me.\nIn the meantime, I also realized that there is another CND$15.95 added on my bill. The travel agent said that is application useing fee because I used seatmap. However, it doesn't display on thire company's web application when customer is using it, finally they agreed to take out that charge as well but it took me about 20 minutes to argue with them and made me fell angry and disppointed totally.\nI am not recommend this web site for sure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:31:24.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

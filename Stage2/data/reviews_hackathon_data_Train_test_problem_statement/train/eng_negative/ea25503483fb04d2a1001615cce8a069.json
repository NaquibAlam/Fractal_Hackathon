After trying to clear the program and return to the printer setup without success, I paid the $9.95 to install it.

Attempts to find it were unsuccessful and while rerunning Driver Support did not detect either mouse or Logitech. \"Unknown devise\" was shown but Windows would not accept it (Error 43).

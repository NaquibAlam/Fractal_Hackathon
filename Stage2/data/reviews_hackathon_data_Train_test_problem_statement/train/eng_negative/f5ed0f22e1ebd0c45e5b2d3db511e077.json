Then when the package came, it was the wrong books! We instead received Stephens Hawkins books. Which I'm sure are great but a little advanced for a 4 and 7 yr old.

I received and email stating that they didn't have a SINGLE second copy of ANY of books we ordered to resend us, and that we would get a full refund. I still haven't seen the refund!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:09:39.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

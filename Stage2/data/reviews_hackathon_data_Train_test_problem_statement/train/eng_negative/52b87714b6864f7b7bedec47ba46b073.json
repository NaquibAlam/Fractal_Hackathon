One consisted of myself and 7 friends waiting for over an hour on an order only to find out after ringing the takeaway that the order had never gone through. Final nail in the coffin was ordering from a takeaway at 11pm when it closes at 11.15pm. The money was taken from my account at 11pm and I assumed he order had gone through until I received an email stating that the order was now being put through as a pre order for the following day as the restaurant had closed (even though I ordered 15 mins prior). Funds in my bank account were low at the time and as I had used the last of it on ordering that food, I didn't have enough to pay for another takeaway and so went hungry that night after doing a 12 hour shift at work! To add to the inconvenience it then took almost 2 weeks for the money to be returned to my account. Throughout this, the customer service agents were mediocre with one claiming I had put the order through too late until I showed a screenshot of the actual time I ordered. No real apology was given and I was made to feel as if I was bothering them when enquiring as to when the money would be returned. I have been using justeat for several years with not a single issue in that time. I tried Marvin out as I found the loyalty stamp scheme enticing. However, after having such poor dealings and several inconveniences, I will not be using it again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T18:13:47.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

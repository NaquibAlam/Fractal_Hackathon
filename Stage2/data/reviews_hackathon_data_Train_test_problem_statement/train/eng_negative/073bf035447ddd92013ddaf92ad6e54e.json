So much for their tag line \"Nothing's worse than a gift arriving late. On Time Assured\" ! First I reported when it did not get delivered on the date. Next I reported when I found out that the cake was hard and stale. The recipient was embarrassed to even let me know, in case they would hurt my feelings. It was a let down for me.\nThey responded back asking me for pictures of the cake to prove that it was hard and stale. Like the recipient would preserve a stale cake for a week and the pictures will scream out to indicate that the cake is stale. I have used flora for a long time and never had an issue. I would have let this pass had they not responded silly and also kept my money.\n#NeverAgainFlora.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:42:16.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

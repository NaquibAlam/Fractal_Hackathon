They would not allow me to redirect shipment to a UPS store. Fed Ex did when I was in WSJ Wine club (got out of it because I joined this one) You need to allow the use of FedEx, or any shipping company the customer wants! I had to pay for wine that I could not accept at home because UPS only delivers when I am at work which was shipped back. I then had to pay a restock fee, then had to pay to have it shipped back to a UPS store which charged me $10 to pick it up. All in all, 6 bottles of wine that was supposed to cost about $90 cost me about $180!!!!

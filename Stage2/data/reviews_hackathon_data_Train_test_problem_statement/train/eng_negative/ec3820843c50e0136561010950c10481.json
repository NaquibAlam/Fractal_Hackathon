At this point the salesman told us they had the exact same car in black at an other branch. We agreed to pay Â£250 to have the car transported & reserved, and brought over to our local branch.\nWe went in tonight to have a look at the car and although it wasn't the exact same trim level and spec as the one we had previously seen, we were quite happy with the car. We said to the sales adviser that we were going to go home, have a chat and get our finances ready to go. We were then told that we had to decide if we wanted the car there and then! we were told if we left the show room the reserve would be removed and we would loose our transportation fee.\nWe spoke to the manager who just kept asking us why we could not make the decision here and now. He was generally rude, patronising and came across very pushy. When i said that we were not told/made aware we had to make a commitment on viewing the car and taking for a test drive the manager told me that it \"was my word against the salesman's\".\nThe pressure the manager put us under with the threat of loosing our reservation money has really upset my girl friend and I.\nWe will be contacting the industry regulates to get our money back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:09:59.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

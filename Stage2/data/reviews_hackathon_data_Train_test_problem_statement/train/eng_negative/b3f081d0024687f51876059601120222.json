My blanket is too small to qualify as a blanket, perhaps a lap warmer, and is very heavy, so at night when I turn over, the whole thing just ends up in a weighted ball somewhere in the bed. I've tried to wear it as a cape, while watching TV; I've put it over and under my comforter...but nothing really works.\nThe color was what I expected. The \"bean bag\" stuffing was not. I'm also wondering why these little pockets with the beans aren't fully filled with banting or cotton. For $200, I was expecting something amazing. The fabric was average, the pockets with plastic beans was odd, and it mostly feels like someone poked a hole in a potentially fluffy blanket and let all the air out.\nI read that returns are prohibited. So, I trusted the website, the reviews and took the plunge. I won't recommend this to anyone I know. In fact, I crochet blankets for loved ones with a high quality, heavy weight yarn...and these are much more even-keeled, balanced, soft and quiet and stay on the covers through the night once you place them there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T08:27:14.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I had to use my old correction glasses all the time, which gave me headaches for almost a month.\nThe worst of all is the additional tax costs for delivery into the EU:\nIn my case unplanned 23,52€, which made the whole decision to buy at a competitive price, appear silly.\nSo I bought for 149,13€.\nIf I placed the order @ Coolframes.uk, I would only have to pay 110,87€ (no shipping, no tax, which means 25% discount) and in only maybe 5 days.\nSo never will I ever place an order again in the US!\nImo it would have been quite easy for the online shop to advise me to shop on the UK homepage. I'm hardly dissappointed from this experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T14:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:10:58.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

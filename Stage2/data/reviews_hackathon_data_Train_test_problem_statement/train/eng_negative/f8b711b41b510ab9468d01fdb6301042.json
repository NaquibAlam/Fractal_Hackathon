In that time:\n1) the response unit took 5 HOURS to show up to my property after a false alarm was triggered by my cat with the motion sensors\n2) motion sensors - they state that the motion sensor technology shouldn't pick up an animal under 40lbs. My cat is DEFINITELY not 40lbs and yet he's activated the alarm twice. The tech support guys have tried everything and nothing works. So I've paid for equipment that isn't being used.\n3) they expect YOU to pay for return postage for their useless, faulty equipment (door sensor this time) and threaten to charge you for the replacement if you don't return the old one in time!\nThis company wouldn't know good customer service if it slapped them in the face! Emails are ignored and they don't bother to return calls or follow up. Do yourself a favour and pay a little extra for more reputable security companies out there. This one is a joke and not worth your hard-earned money!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T15:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T21:07:52.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I needed to cancel this and was told that I would be able to cancel. However after multiple emails, calls to operator, being told that their systems were down and not working, then further emails and no reply or contact at all. I would not recommend this company at all.\nI had a reply to my review that the case had been resolved but no one has answered my email, I said that I tried to cancel my booking and asked for confirmation that in fact that it had been cancelled but no reply, even after this review they still have not confirmed that my reservation was cancelled. Please can you reply to my emails and read what I has asked !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T17:35:10.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

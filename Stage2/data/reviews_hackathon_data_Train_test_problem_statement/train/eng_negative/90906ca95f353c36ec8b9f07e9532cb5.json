Ordered for our family members.\nThe time of delivery was at 9:00AM. We didn't see the flowers at the service. I tracked them on the website, it said it was in delivery, this was at 12:00 PM! I called, was on hold for a total of thirty minutes, during the waiting , my call was disconnected 3 times, I talked first with a tired sounding woman who sounded like she was just waking up, she said something and the phone disconnected, I called back, waited another 10 minutes, finally man answered, tried to review how to place an order, at this point I was so frustrated, I asked to talk to a manager, so I was again put on hold, the same man told me the flowers were delivered by UPS at 11:00 AM the funeral was over!! What's the point of having flowers deliver after the funeral? Well in the end they said they would issue a full refund and a gift card, we will see if they follow through. The gift card will not be needed!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T04:20:59.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

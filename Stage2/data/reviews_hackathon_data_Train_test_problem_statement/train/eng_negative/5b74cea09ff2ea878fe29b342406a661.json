After spending 30 minutes on hold the first time and the recording keeps stating to file your claim online. After speaking with NFM they stated there is nothing they can do, and if my stain had occurred within the first year, they would have sent a technician out themselves. So sorry that I take care of my furniture so that it last!.\nNebraska Furniture Mart you can say what you will, but I paid you the money and you are not taking care of me the customer!

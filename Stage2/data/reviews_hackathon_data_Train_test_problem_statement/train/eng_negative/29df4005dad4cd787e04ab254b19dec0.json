However our last stay was very disappointing. The heat stopped working in our cabin and I called Outrageous Cabins. Instead of taking care of the issue themselves, they gave me the number for the HVAC company. I literally spent the next 4 hours either on the phone with the technician, trying their recommendations to fix the unit and ultimately waiting for an after hours technician to arrive. Outrageous Cabins did not offer us anything in the way of \"apologies \" nor were any discounts, next stay offers, etc offered. We felt it was their responsibility to fix the problem; but they made us take care of it. There are plenty of options when it comes to cabin rentals and while we will certainly continue to go to Gatlinburg, we probably won't use Outrageous Cabins again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:26:19.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I replied to this email, but received another one the day before the delivery date saying that my order had been dispatched without those details and delivery couldn't be guaranteed. I replied yet again with the details in question, and was told they'd been forwarded to the florist. On the day of delivery I received another email saying that due to logistical problems the delivery would be delayed by two days. As I wasn't sure if anyone would be home on the new date (and to be honest was losing all hope) I asked for the order to be cancelled and refunded so I could make alternative arrangements. This was agreed by email, and I duly ordered another bunch of flowers from a different supplier. But then, as if by magic, the original bunch has been delivered. As happy as my girlfriend is with her flowers, I really can't afford to be sending two bunches at a time, so I'm hoping I'll still be receiving my refund, but I won't hold my breath. All in all, bit of a nightmare experience, I'd say avoid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:50:31.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

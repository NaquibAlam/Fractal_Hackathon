I received a text message stated that my driver is waiting for me with a designation while I was at Baggage Collection.\nI got out of the airport and cannot find my driver, rang the number given and the office is closed. Walked around with heavy cases for 30 minutes around the airport and scanned all the faces and named cardboard. My driver was not there!\nI then went to the Information booth, the concierge rang the number printed on my text message 3 times. We then gave up and ordered a local taxi to take me to my hotel.\nNext day I emailed and rang the number listed on text message, on listed on the website. They did not bother to answer or acknowledge my email.\nSo I did not get my refund or speak to them to highlight my concern. So people. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!\nBe warn!\nAnn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:20:43.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

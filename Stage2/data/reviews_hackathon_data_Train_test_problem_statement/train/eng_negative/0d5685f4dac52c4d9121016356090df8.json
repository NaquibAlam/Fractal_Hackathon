Clearly on the booking it said book now, pay later, but my card has been debited the full amount.\nI have tried to find an email address to email but can only find USA numbers in the contact here section of the app and I'm trying to avoid a huge bill to make overseas call. Email details would be nice.\nI did try call the actual hire company, even though in a different country several times with no answer.\nI have found my first experience has been very poor, and while I am willing to see if it improves when we actually get the car, I can't help but think I've made a mistake booking through your service sadly.\nLooking forward to someone trying to rectify this decision asap to avoid further disappointment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:16:56.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

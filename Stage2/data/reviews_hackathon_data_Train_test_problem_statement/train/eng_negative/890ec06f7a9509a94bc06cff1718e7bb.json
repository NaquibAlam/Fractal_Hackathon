If you live in the states, and are unable to call a European number for free, then STAY AWAY. You will only be able to communicate with them via email, and they will take on average 5 business days to reply.\nThe agents are extremely unhelpful. I purchased a ticket in May 2016 for a trip to Trinidad in February 2017. They ended up charging my card TWICE, but the problem was fixed via my bank. Of course I purchased the insurance but make sure to read carefully which insurance because one of them is basically a hoax. I turned ill, and had to cancel the trip. When it came to using my insurance (which I paid extra for), I was hit with the BIGGEST HASSLE of life. You would think that they were refunding me my money from their own personal pay check. It was ridiculous. I provided them with a doctor's note, and they refused to accept it. Short of turning in my personal medical records, they refused to honor the insurance policy that I paid extra for. Mind you this was after it took them days to reply to my email requesting to cancel. I had to practically research every department's email before receiving a response. When they finally responded to my 3rd email, it was to copy and paste the insurance policy, no real explanation as to why they wouldn't cancel, just that they deemed my doctor's note invalid. Finally, my doctor contacted them personally on the hospital's phone (super long distance), and they informed me the hospital's \"stamp\" was required. I am not sure why they are going through such measures to assist me when I purchased insurance and provided them with a doctor's note.\nFinally they are willing to let me use my insurance for my ticket. The problem with the refund is because they double charged my card in May, my bank closed that card for my protection. The refund for my security could only be submitted to that card. The email from their agent requested I inform them how I would like to move forward once I have contacted my bank. I replied back and specifically told them NOT to refund but to instead reschedule my ticket. I wrote them at least four times, and waited over a week for a response. I finally called the airlines directly yesterday (3/6/17) only to find out that they had refunded the ticket already without my approval. This refund only gave me 85% of my money back instead of allowing me to reschedule with the full amount of my ticket.\nNeedless to say, you are better off booking with expedia or priceline. I would rather pay more to not feel like I have been scammed. The amount of stress I gained while being sick and dealing with their terrible customer service has been ridiculous. Planning your vacation is not worth all of this hassle. Stay away from this INEFFECTIVE company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:31:34.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

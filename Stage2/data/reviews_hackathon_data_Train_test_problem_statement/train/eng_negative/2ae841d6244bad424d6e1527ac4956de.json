Rental cost £273 with Ace Rentals in Auckland for a Yaris or similar. Flight times subsequently changed, and I tried through Rentalcars.com website to change the booking, to pick the car up 24hrs later, 28/3/17-16/4/17. cost would go up to £625 for a day less rental!\nOn-line chat with Retalcars.com confirmed this, and suggested I contact Ace direct as Rentalcars.com cannot control the costs the suppliers put on their website. Emailed Ace. No, they could not change booking it had to be done through Rentalcars.com. as the agency. Back to Ace, can you just hold the car in the carpark for 24hrs then, happy to pay full time, just pick it up 24hrs later. No, can’t do that because it has been booked by the agency and I should contact them. Bit of a stalemate. Cancelled the booking. Searching again on several websites, Rentalcars.com still came up with the best deal, and again with Ace in Auckland, so ended up booking with them again, but for 28/3/17 to 16/4/17 at £391 plus insurance. Still an increase of £118 for a day less, possibly because smallest car available was not a Yaris but a Tilda or similar. Went back to Ace and pointed this out, they did come back to me with an email, assuring me that the original booking has been cancelled and explaining how to upgrade the car. Not what I was highlighting at all. As an expat Kiwi, I'm disappointed in Ace's handling,but Rentalcars.com is also very inflexible in human terms - if the system says X then X it is.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:39:38.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was very impressed at the durability of these tees and how long each one lasted so I ordered some. When they arrived i took some out to use during a round on the very first drive it snapped i couldn't believe it so later in the round i tried another one that snapped as well. I got on the phone to Clubhouse Golf who informed me that all tees snap and that my original ones couldn't have lasted as long as i had claimed i was furious. On closer inspection i noticed my original tees seemed a different material to the one's Clubhouse Golf had sent me. So I ordered the same product from American Golf to see if it was a manufacturing issue but when arrived they were exactly the same as my original tees. I noticed the one's from Clubhouse Golf were made in Thailand the one's from American Golf were made in China one is really brittle the other is very bendy.l will not be ordering from Clubhouse Golf any more as i thought they were very rude and condescending.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T09:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T18:43:53.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

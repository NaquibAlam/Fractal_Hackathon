The fact that I had to contact the manufacturer to verify that indeed there is no supply issue speaks volumes.\nHere's the chain of emails... and I'm STILL waiting on an order from Black Friday LAST YEAR. Now the ETA is Mid-March... this is the third time it has changed.\nOrder 67977130 Status\nCURRENT STATUS: Waiting For Backordered Items To Arrive\nYour order is on hold while we wait for your backordered items to arrive\nAdditional quantities due mid March\n2/23/2017\nIs there any update on this order? Again, Aerotech doesn't have a supply issue, so it should be possible for you to provide an ETA on this order. I'm really trying to be patient on this, but you'd have to agree, 3 months after the order placed, still not even an ETA on arrival and the manufacturer has plenty in stock.\nI'll be posting feedback on this order to the rocketry hobby forums so others are aware. My previous experiences with Hobbylinc have been good, this one has been horrible.\nMonday, February 13, 2017 1:33 PM\nSubject: Re: Hobbylinc Order 67977130\nI apologize for the confusion, our site has not been updated. We are actually expecting these back in to us hopefully by the end of the week. We have them due back in around mid February. We should be able to fill your order and have it shipped in full very shortly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:19:06.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

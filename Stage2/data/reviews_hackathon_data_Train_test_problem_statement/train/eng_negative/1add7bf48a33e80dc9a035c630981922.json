My son had told me about Lyft so it was my first time using them. The driver was infomed what terminal to meet me and the door # which was all preprogrammed in the app. I waited and waited and an Uber driver came to ask if I was waiting for a ride. I said I was waiting for Lyft. I tried to contact by calling and texting the driver but she did not respond. Finally there was a taxis nearby and I went by taxis at more than double the price. Then Lyft assessed me a cancellation fee to add insult to injury. Lousy service and I will never use them again. DO NOT USE LYFT!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:10:02.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

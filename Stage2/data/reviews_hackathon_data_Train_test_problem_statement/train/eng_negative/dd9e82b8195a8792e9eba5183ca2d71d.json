But now... I booked a car today - and afterwards emailed the company to ask them to apply my loyaltydiscount. This is normal.\nWhat is not normal, is that the member of staff now tells me that the loaltydiscount only apply to the basic rate - the cheapest.\nThis means practically that i - having booked a full-pack, receives no discount at all - maybe 6 euros in a booking of 260 euros.\nThis is bad business. I asked the member of staff to send me a link, in which this rule of only basic loyaltydiscount - and he refuses to do so. Nowhere om Malagacars website does it say that the discount only is for the cheapest rate - therefore close to nothing.\nI have cancelled my booking, and taken my business elsewhere.\nThis is a shame - I have had no problems for many years.\nBolette", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:22:43.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

However the quality was not as good as expected. Looking at previous reviews I was expecting a better quality. The blinds themselves material is very thin and flimsy and looks cheap. The cord chain control and mechanism is plastic so looks cheap and is quite flimsy. When changing the direction of the blinds it feels like they don't want to rotate and that they are going to break.

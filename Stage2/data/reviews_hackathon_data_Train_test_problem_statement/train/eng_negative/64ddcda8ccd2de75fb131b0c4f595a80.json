Unfortunatelly it seems that company grow to the point that can't handle anymore with all customers and don't care about them. Recently I booked a hotel in Mexico and was partly charged straight away after even during booking process nothing was mentioned about that. I got this information together with booking confirmation. It wasn't a big problem for me till moment when I decided to change my plans and cancel this booking. First of all I contacted Booking.com after couple of days asking when refund wil be make. I was ensured that it would be very shortly and I will be informed about that. After couple of days of silence I've contacted them again and surprisingly was asked for proof of this charge!!! Of course I provided my statment and again was ensured that refund will be proceed shorly. After other couple of days I was informed that refund has been done already and I need to wait. 1.5 week later without any updates I called again and found out that hotel couldn't proceed refund because my bank blocked it!!! JOKE!!! at the same time I was informed that case was escalated to Finance department and someone will contact me shortly to proceed refund this time by BOOKING.COM itself..Well again silence, no email replies ets. Today I called them again and was informed that refund will take AT LEAST 2 ANOTHER WEEKS!!!! Well ...I just want to say that it's very sad and dissapointing when trusted and good company changing so badly. I will think twice before making another booking with them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:27:42.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

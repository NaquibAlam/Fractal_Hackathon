After hours and hours of dealing with what was a possible virus, I spent hours JUST trying to remove the program, as I could see in the Task Manager that processes were still running and I *could not* kill those processes. I could not manually remove the directory.\nThe uninstall failed 3 or more times. (I had to reinstall as part of the process to try and get it to uninstall properly before I gave up on that). Using the control panel to try and repair the program *also* did not repair that the program *would not* uninistall.\nWhat angers me most is that Lavasoft is completely aware of the massive difficulties some have removing their program, (if you don't believe me, just take a look at their forums) and yet, here it is still just about impossible to get rid of. After following every instruction I could find on Lavasoft's Forums, and several of the standard answers being things I could not accomplish because the files referenced did not exist anywhere on my system that the system could find, and each further step being more and more ridiculously involved, becoming too frustrated to complete the instructions to do x, y and z and return results to Lavasoft for someone to try and help me undo this completely outrageous uninstall, I was *livid*.\nWith overwhelming disgust, I threw in the towel with respect to Lavasoft providing a fix that did not involve an unacceptable amount of work and effort on my part, and after more googling I finally came upon someone on the Microsoft Forums who provided a walk through, which also detailed and annoying in how many steps had to be taken to simply remove this program. I had to download Malwarebyte's FileAssassin. THEN, the instructions for keeping it from trying to reinstall everytime, it turned out, did NOT work completely because every single time I had to open File Explorer (which was quite a bit), it tried to reinstall itself AGAIN.\nFinally, I found something via google where someone had had some success with Ccleaner in getting the program to stop doing this. So now I *just* have the service running, which does not appear to be eating up any noticeable amount of resources, but that's there it ends.\nSo, in the end. I was STILL unable to remove Ad-Aware after a completely unacceptable amount of work and effort, but the result appears to be near the same, as long as it doesn't bother me to see it STILL on my SYSTEM when I'm poking about.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:41:10.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

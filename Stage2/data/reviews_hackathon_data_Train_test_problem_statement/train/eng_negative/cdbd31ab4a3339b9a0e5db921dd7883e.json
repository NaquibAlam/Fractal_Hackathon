Airport Serv.\". from € 30,75 for delivery in place other than the withdrawal.\nAs you can see from the screenshot below on my voucher that fee is \"ZERO\".\nCattura.JPG\nI asked to Europcar and Rentalcars repayment of that amount but at the moment no answer.\nRegardless of the scandalous consideration towards the customer demonstrated by employee of Europcar would you see who is trying to screw me Rentalcars because he sold me a voucher with false entries or Europcar that doesn’t care about what is written on this?\nSandro B", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:04:37.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

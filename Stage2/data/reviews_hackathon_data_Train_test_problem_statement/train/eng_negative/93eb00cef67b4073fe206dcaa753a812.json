We took the coffee table home with us and then my husband picked up the headboard last Wednesday. We opened the boxes and found the side rails were missing along with the hardware. My husband called our sales person Abe PItts and told him about it which he was supposed to call back in 10 minutes. After having to go out of town for a wedding, my husband called him today (Sunday 3/26) to see what was going on and we just wanted to pick up the missing pieces. We were told we had to bring it all back and exchange it. My husband said if we had to pack it all up then we were going to return it. Abe talked to the manager and said we had to bring it all back, we could not just pick up the missing pieces. My husband went to the store and talked to the manager Dave who said he could not open a box and give us the missing pieces even though that is what they gave us. We are very unhappy with the lack of customer service. I felt we were being Inconvenienced only because of the poor management of their warehouse. In any case, they have definitely lost a customer for life and we will make sure to let our friends and family know about our experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:58:05.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Rented a car from Gold car for ten days in Gran Canaria. When I arrived I was asked if I wanted to take additional car insurance, I declined (because I had already purchased additional insurance with another online provider).\nThe lady behind the desk handed me a contract in Spanish and I was told I needed to pay a refundable deposit.\nWhen I returned home I discovered they hadn't given me all my deposit back. I called the Gold Car office and was told I had agreed to take the additional insurance and signed the contract. I kicked up a fuss and they gave me an email address.\nI emailed and got a response to say, as I signed the contract nothing I can do. I even sent them proof of the other insurance I had taken out. I felt my case wasn't dealt with properly and they never answered any of my questions (just kept copying and pasting the last email they sent me).\nIt's an absolute scam and I can't believe they get away with it. They have taken Â£150 from my account and it's disgraceful! You only have to google them and see all the bad things.\nI don't ever write reviews but I would advise everyone to avoid using Gold Car.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T22:42:04.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

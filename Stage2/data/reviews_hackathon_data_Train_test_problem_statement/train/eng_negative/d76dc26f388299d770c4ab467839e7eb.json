Booked a holiday of a lifetime or so we thought!!\n- after booking a year in advance turned up to be told that there was no room (booked in accident the year before!!) and what was supposed to be a romantic holiday was spent in a small room with single beds after hours of negotiation to try and get us a room.\n- Had to go back every morning and several times throughout the day to get them to change the room wasting hours of our holiday\n- booking agent has taken no responsibility for the mistakes and left us to sort it\n- booked us on a wine tour on a bank holiday leaving us 2 hours of a 5 hour tour because everything was closing\n- agent was rude and arrogant in response\n- no resolution after 5 weeks of the issues You are supposed to book with agents for peace of mind and professionalism. You would be better booking it yourself because at least you can make the mistakes!! Shocking and will never use them again. Understand mistakes can happen but it's the way they manage the resolution which has angered me the most.\nBOOKING AGENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO GET THE DETAIL RIGHT THAT IS THEIR PROFESSION! FOR ANYONE READING THIS PLEASE LOOK AT THE REPLY!! THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY RESOLVE ISSUES AND THEIR GENERAL TONE OF VOICE IS CONDESCENDING!!

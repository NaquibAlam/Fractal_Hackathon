We were then invited on the Goldcar website to pay in advance for fuel which was a total 70.54€ and it clearly stated 0€ to pay on arrival on my printout, however we were made to pay again for fuel a further 52.07€ + 19.01 administration fee on arrival.\nI was deeply annoyed by this as I thought I had saved myself some bother on arriving and owing to either a very misleading website or error I have paid twice for fuel.\nI have contacted customer services 3 times with neither acknowledgement or reply given\nI believed Goldcar were one of the more reputable companies in Spain, but I have been disgusted by how they have overcharged me and blankly refuse to reply. Saw so many horrifying stories about this comany, when looking to see if others had encountered similar issues.\nAvoid this company", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T16:46:51.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They also advertised that all leggings were 2 for 24$ for the month of my birthday and that did not happen. When I added the 2 pairs I wanted the one pair was \"out of stock\" even though when I went to add it again it said there was one left. Could not get it to work so I added a new pair to get my 2 for 24$ deal then all of a sudden when the ones I originally wanted were at full price I could buy them again. They were not available for sale price only full VIP price when everything should have been discounted for my first hour as a new member. NOT IMPRESSED with the way it was ran. Also everything I was interested in and clicking on when I had the XS filter picked was not available in an XS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T23:44:43.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The same day it was installed it broke because of it was a cheap and flimsy antenna. CB World will ONLY allow positive reviews to be posted. I had send 2 negative reviews and they were never posted. Now I am out $49.39 for a antenna I cannot use. I contacted Hustles antenna to tell them of the problem and they told me I would have to buy the part,no problem... BUT the price of the 1 part was $20.00. Now the part is 1 of the smallest parts on the antenna, the only parts smaller is the set screw and the sleeve( the part is about 3/4\"x1/4\"). CB World knows of the problem and never got back to me in any way. It shows me they don't care about the customer at all. I will never buy from CB World again.\nAfter reading their reply I still stand by my reviews. If the antenna had been stronger the base would have never broke.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T07:41:36.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

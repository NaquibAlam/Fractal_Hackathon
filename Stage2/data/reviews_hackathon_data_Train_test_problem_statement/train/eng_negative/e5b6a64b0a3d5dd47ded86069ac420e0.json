Prices are keen, and so long as you don't have an issue will score the company 10/10. However on occasion you will need post sales support; for this they wish you to use their \"emessage\" system. I sent an emessage regarding the Asus laptop I bought in November. Got a totally off the wall reply telling me to contact Lenovo We all make mistakes, but since I pointed out that it was Asus, I have had no replies, and I've asked them 3 times - no replies.\nMoral of this story. you take risks with this company, so long as there is no need for post sales support you will be fine. But if you are risk averse, then shop elsewhere. There are too many similar reports of similar issues with LaptopsDirect.\nCustomer Service is non-existent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:35:01.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

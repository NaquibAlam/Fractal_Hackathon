I ordered a shipment this past Monday, Feb. I3 and made sure to spend $56.55 (well over the required $49 for free 1-2 day shipment) because my cat needed the food quickly.\nToday, Thurs. Feb. 16, I checked the status to see why my shipment hadn't arrived yet. The tracking order said it hadn't left the warehouse yet. When I called customer service, they gave me some song and dance about I ordered on a Monday and they had to check with the vet (they require you put the vet's info on the order for prescription food). I had entered all the info and there was no reason for the delay.\nThe rep said she'll call the vet now but clearly the order wasn't shipping any time soon. I'm not sure I'll trust this company again.\nVery disappointed customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:10:29.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This makes absolutely no sense to me. I stayed on the phone or over 2 hours on hold waiting to speak with a manager who ultimately did not even attempt to solve the problem. NEVER call their phone lines they are unhelpful, and the language barrier makes it impossible to discuss the problem at hand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T20:08:02.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

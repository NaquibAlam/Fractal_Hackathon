ProBikekit advised a EST Delivery Date between 24/1 - 25/1. I contacted them in early Feb and advised them that I had not yet received delivery which was quite unusual as I had always received deliveries on or around the EST Deliver Date advised. They advised that I had to wait 30 Days. Today I received an item from Probikekit which I ordered 17 days after the now missing Order. Thinking that this would confirm to Probikekit that this particular order had gone astray/missing especially when I had received an order (I had placed 17 days after) I made contact with them today to initiate proceedings. Thinking that this would be enough proof that the delivery was lost and being only 1 day from the 30Days I would have thought that ProbIkeKit would have assumed the same and commenced with their investigations and maybe actually send another one in its place due to the fact that 29 days had passed.\nBut no. I have to wait another day as \"we would have to allow the full 30 days before we can look in to this.\" How ridiculous. The fact that I had received a delivery from them which I had ordered 17 days after the missing order is not enough proof that the parcel is missing.\nThe last time I buy anything from these jokers Stay away", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:46:35.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

But nothing is happening, after spending 620 pounds on this phone i dont expect this sort of service from apple, i am so disappointed. Literally disgusting customer service. Its not even my fault that there is a lock on it, its apples fault but they are not just sorting it out, seems like its never going to work and apple is unable to solve the issue!

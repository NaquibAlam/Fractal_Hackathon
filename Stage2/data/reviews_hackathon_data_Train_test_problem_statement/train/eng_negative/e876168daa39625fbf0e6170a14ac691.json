Be prepared for some strong arm tactics from an once friendly sales agent when you decline their additional insurance. Taking advice form moneysavingsexpert.com I purchased the additional insurance to cover all the stuff Goldcars don't cover and was met with a degree of aggression that could lead you to part with cash just to escape the torrent of lies designed to scare you into buying from them. Also, be warned that if unavoidably you can't return the car with a full tank there is a 50 euro \"fine\" on top of the cost of the top up of fuel. I did mean to ask if it was possible to pay for the fuel up front (which some companies offer) but was so taken aback by the trashing of my Allianze additional and lower cost insurance that I forgot to ask the 7 feet tall bloke on the other side of the counter - he was 5'7\" sitting down! Also they \"block\" 1100 euros on your card for damage etc. so it's important you get the cover for that in advance and at a proper rate, not their massively expensive rate. Other than that the car was great, nearly new and not a thing wrong about it. Good Luck!\nPlease note the reply from Goldcar below:\nThe respondent has clearly not read what I said in my review of their appalling service.\nI note that an additional 97 Euros was added to my Pre-Paid invoice at the time of rental - I was not advised that this would happen and did not notice until after I read the Hire Agreement that was shoved at me at the time of hire. I was ONLY advised about the 1100 euro block.\nI spoke to Goldcar customer service and was told that the 97 Euros is added \"routinely\" to the account in the expectation that the car will not be refuelled!! What a load of utter rubbish!!!\n1. Don't use Goldcar unless you absolutely have to.\n2. Don't buy their insurance over the desk under any circumstances\n3. Buy your additional cover from a reputable insurance company in the UK\n4. Ignore the scare tactics made by the sales agents at the desk\n5. check the amount you are going to have blocked against your credit BEFORE you sign the electronic pad!!\n6. If you have time fill / top up IMMEDIATELY before you arrive at the return point otherwise you will be \"rooked\" for the 50 euro \"penalty\"\n7. In summary - DONT USE GOLDCAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T12:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:52:51.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

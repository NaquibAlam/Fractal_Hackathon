Just hired a car for 3 days and they told us they gonna hold 200 $ and send us back if all toll and fines are fine. So we were happy with out trip and was flyin back to sydney.later when we took the car back to them they checked the car and showed us the small tiny dent which can be hardly seen and told us to pay $4400... we were totally shocked and never expect that we will be forced to pay so much and when we asked how we can claim it back they had no idea.. they just know how to get the money ....dats it..we were forced to pay $4400 and thats huge some of money . I tried to call and they always say that their claim department id looking after it... but for how long are they gonna look at it just for a tiny dent.

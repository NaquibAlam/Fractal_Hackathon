We approached them because of their Gold Supplier medal advertised on Alibaba.com Long story short, we received the samples 3 weeks after the promised date and the quality was like it was made by a 8yrs old child for their craft workshop. We then made a complaint with Alibaba.com suggesting the seller is only trying to scam our one-off sampling payment and they never intended to work with us with the mass production, so we think we at least deserve a full refund. Alibaba customer service gave us this ridiculous reply saying the sampling stage is for us to review the quality and decide wether or not to go forward. They obviously did not look into our case, we spent 3 hours compiling all the evidence and conversation logs to prove them the seller has a serious issue of lack of response and the samples they delivered was beyond our imagination. We then suspect the Alibaba customer service was on the seller's side (of course they are) and our payment was made through Paypal.com Hence we ended up making a dispute on Paypal.com The seller responded lightly and it took him a week to reply a message. We ended up agreeing on Paypal resolution centre that he will refund us if we return the samples. Yet he gave us a very vague address without company name, building name and postcode (in China, they need postcode to identify districts and such.) We then asked for the address again (even ask them in Chinese). He did not reply as usual, until the case was about to be closed, he still hasn't respond to us. We called him and we successfully reached him, during our conversation. The only thing he said was we have refunded you then hung up. We believed him (how stupid of us) and we gave him a few days to arrange the refund. We emailed him, texted him, contacted him again on Alibaba, no reply. And by that time, our Paypal case has been closed due to the seller REFUSED our case. This is our experience working with seller on Alibaba.com. I am a Chinese national myself, and I am very disappointed with this multi billion company and their corruption within. Please DO NOT USE Alibaba.com to source, I am pretty sure there are good companies/factories out there on Alibaba.com and we had worked with one prior to this bad experience. We are a start-up company, working with that supplier made us delayed our launch for few months due to their non trustworthy behaviour. To avoid this happening to your new company (we understand money and time is very crucial for a start-up), please for god's sake DO NOT USE Alibaba.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:16:27.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

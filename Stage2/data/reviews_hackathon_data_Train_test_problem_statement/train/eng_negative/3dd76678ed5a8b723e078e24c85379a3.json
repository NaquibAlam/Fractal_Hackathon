In short it's your choice, no one else's, what happened to me however defies belief.\nSunday I logged in on my phone and noticed that £50 had disappeared from my balance, upon looking at my account history it showed as being transferred....nothing else.\nObviously I instantly called Customer service and raised the issue and was told that it had been transferred to the Poker section....strange as I never play poker and was actually laying MArio Kart on the Wii when this supposed transfer and gameplay took place.\nNow, the cynics will think that I just lost £50 playing poker and I'm a sore loser I lost £3000 online last week with PP, I'm not about to try and falsely claim £50, trust me.\nAnyhow, I get sent a form and fill it out and return it, it says a 48 hours turnaround.\nFast forward 4 days and still nothing, account still frozen, money still missing, no update other than 'It's with our security team'\nThe weirdest thing of all, no one knows my PP login information apart from me. I only ever play on my Mac or iPhone, my phone was in my pocket and my mac was locked in my empty house (and I've checked the history just in case of remote login) and it's clean.\nWhomever accessed my account did the transfer at 19.16pm and then waited 45 minutes to start playing and then played for 20 mins before stopping and leaving a balance of 18USD.\nEven if they had won the money would have been credited back to my bank card or been withdrawn by my PP CashPlus card both of which were in my wallet.\nThere was a balance of £400....so why they only transferred £50 is again very strange.\nThe conclusion is that PP have not stuck to their turnaround times and are offering terrible customer service, I will be going elsewhere from now on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:53:47.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

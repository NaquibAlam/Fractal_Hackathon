Rude. It takes them forever to get back to you.\nThey don't ccare about their customers or their colleagues\nI have been renting properties for a while on several major portals, and one of them is tripadvisor.\nThey would take the reviews from a property without even asking, just because someone asked them\nSo here is how you can steal a property's reviews on tripadvisor\n- Create a free listing\n- Copy any listing out there. Especially a villa. Download the photos and re-upload them as yours. Create a new description, fix the prices.\n- Send an email to tripadvisor that the original listing should be de-activated becuase you created a new one\n- When they De-Activate it send another email (it never goes to the same person) asking to move your reviews from the old \"De-Activated Listing\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:08:14.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

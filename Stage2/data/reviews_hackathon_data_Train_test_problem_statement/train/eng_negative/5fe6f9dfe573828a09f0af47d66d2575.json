The money was taken by Agoda and the room at the hotel cancelled as apparently WeChat would not authorise the payment although it had already been taken. I was told that the refund had been processed and I had to wait 10 working days for the refund. I did not receive it and then was told this was an error. I have had to twice prove they took the money as they maintain they hadn't taken it. Situation at the moment is that after nearly a month of trying to get a refund, I am now being told I have to wait 30 days after the processing date for the refund to be back in my e-wallet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T12:31:15.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

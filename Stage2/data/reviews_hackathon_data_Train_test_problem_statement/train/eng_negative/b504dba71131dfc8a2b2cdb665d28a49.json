I ordered a $100 voucher from Fishpond on 14/03/2017, on 17/03/2017 it was confirmed by their courier company that this parcel is missing. After 6 emails to Fishpond (who don't have a phone number customers can contact), and 5 phone calls to the courier company, this is how I have been treated : each time a DIFFERENT Fishpond personnel replies and I have to regurgitate my situation; they have not apologised or shown the slightest will to help solve the scenario; even after I email them with the helpful courier company's email confirming 1, parcel is missing 2, only Fishpond can resolve with courier as only Sender has contracting relationship with courier - Fish pond STILL responds telling me to contact courier company and sort this out MYSELF.\nAt this moment in time - 23/03/2017 - I have had no refund, no reissued voucher come my way, no resolution - only a very sincerely helpful and willing-to-admit-mistake courier company.\nA deeply disappointed customer - I would give 0 or negative stars if I could,\nCynthia", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:54:53.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This is what happened to us, when we booked our return flight from Amsterdam to Melbourne, it appeared we would only do one stop-over. We were wrong. We had to leave on Bali, take all our bags with us, get in a different plane to Indonesia, take all our bags again, and board in the last plane to Melbourne. If we knew this it would be ok, but we didn't. We would easily buy a different ticket if only we knew - well, this brings me to a simple User Interface change - add feedback on these specific flights. Hopefully you can add it to the backlog of features to build. All the best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:16:01.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

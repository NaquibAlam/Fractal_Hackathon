We loved my mothers and asked which mattress she purchased. When I called Gardner White I was told that they never carried the mattress style. Gardner White carried the brand but not the style. I asked which was most like the one I was interested in. The sales associate just said I would need to come in. I then called two other stores and was educated about mattresses and one even said they didn't make the one my mother had but there is one like it. We decided to give all three stores a chance and visited each. After visiting all three we called Gardner White to purchase our new mattress. I was told that our fantastic sales associate Kimmwas with other customers and would call us back. After at least an hour I called back and was connected to Kim. I asked if she got our message and was told no. She heard her name being called and when she asked was told there weren't any messages. We ordered our mattress including the mattress pad to ensure our warranty would remain intact. This was on Sunday. I also let Kim know that I wasn't available for delivery until after 2 pm the following Friday. She wrote down the information. I got a phone call at 10am saying they would deliver my mattress between 11am-1pm. I asked how that was possible. I asked if they had any instructions on delivery as far as time restraints. They said yes that I requested after 2pm. I asked if I could have a later delivery time. I was told it wasn't possible and would either have to be at home or reschedule deliver. I had to have my son who is in medical school come home to meet the delivery man. When the mattress was delivered there wasn't a mattress pad. I have waited now at least a week for the mattress pad to be delivered. Your company has given me the run around. I received a phone call asking if I had received the pad. I asked why they would not know whether it was delivered. I was suppose to get a phone call back letting me know if it was sent via mail. I then called corporate customer service who told me you are out of mattress pads. I explained that I just received a phone call asking if I got the mattress pad and if not did I want to pick one up. I said I didn't understand how that could be. They told me to call the store. They might have some. I called the store and was told that one would be mailed out. I asked why one wasn't mailed since the delivery man said it would. I also asked this past Wednesday if they would call me when the mattress pad was sent. It is Friday night and I HAVE NOT HEARD from your company. When someone pays close to 4000 dollars for a mattress you would think you would get better service.\nRobin Sternberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:17:52.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

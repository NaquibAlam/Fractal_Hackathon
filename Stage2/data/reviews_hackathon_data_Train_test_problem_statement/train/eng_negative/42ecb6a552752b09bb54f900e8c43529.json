After they destroyed several of my packages last time I used them, I vowed never to use them again. However, a few months later I again wanted something from the US so decided to give them another try. Bought the item and had it shipped to my US address with Shipito. However when I tried to login I was unable to do so. Contacted customer service. Was told someone would look into it and get back to me. Weeks later and still waiting for a reply. I simply cannot for the life of me understand why this company spends time and money trying to attract new customers, whilst at the same time trying so hard to drive their existing customers away. Absolutely Unbelievable. Avoid this company like the plague!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:06:12.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

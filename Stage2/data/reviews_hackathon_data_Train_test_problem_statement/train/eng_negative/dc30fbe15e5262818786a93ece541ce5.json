Have asked for a refund more than 6 times as nothing had been sent, eventually they tell me its been half shipped but wont give a tracking number. Then after asking again and again for a refund a tracking number is provided and only booked in 30 mins after my last email again asking for a refund. Absolutely disgraceful and still they wont cancel my order and refund even though they have not sent it out. I have emailed a complaint to trading standards and paypal and see what happens now with that to whether or not i get my refund or told just more fabricated stories. What a disgraceful company indeed. I am very upset and will continue to post my reviews on these sites for other buyers to beware of the problems of getting a refund if needed... only word is disgraceful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:14:41.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Upon picking up BMW I did not realize it was a smaller version 3 series BMW. When I returned it the next day (Business had already closed) I was told they will issue the 3 series to customers if the original request was not available. However, I was not told this upon completing paperwork for the 5 series and the price difference did not reflect such change on my receipt. As luck would have it the 5 series became available when I returned to cancel the 3 series rental. However the clerk had to redo the paperwork a second time as my receipt still displayed the higher rate 5 series and not the 3 series they gave me. I guess my biggest complaint came when I asked if the car could be washed to remove the leaves, twigs, bird droppings and such from the car. The sales rep hosed the car down and said I was all set. At which time I asked another clerk in the cleaning bay area where there was a vacuum, and cleaning supplies if he had a towel so I could wipe the excessive water off the car, so it would not streak. He stood up from his sitting position, put his cell phone down and reached over and handed me a towel. I wiped the car down and drove on my merry way. I simply assumed he would wipe the car down for me the customer and not just hand me a towel to do it myself especially after he watched the sales rep hose the car down. Aside from that minor setback the car great. Oh, did I mention there was less than a quarter tank of gas in the car and the low gas light was on when I received it, so first stop was at the gas station.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T09:53:56.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

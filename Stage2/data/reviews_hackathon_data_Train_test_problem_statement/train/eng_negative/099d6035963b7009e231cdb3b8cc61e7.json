Terrible customer service, they were more concerned with selling us an indirect flight back to the UK (not even our airport) for Â£250+ each rather then get us home.\nA complaint is in but now they are saying because we flew to a another country using our cancelled ticket (so we could try and get ourselves home, which we did via another 2 flights) that we are not entitled to compensation, an absolute joke and ruined the whole holiday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T21:54:00.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

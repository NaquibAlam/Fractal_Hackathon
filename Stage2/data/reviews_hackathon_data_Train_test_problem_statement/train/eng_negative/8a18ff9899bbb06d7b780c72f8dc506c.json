Ordered 9 Nostalgia digests & got 9 but 1 was duplicated so 1 was missing. I call once & get ext to call back next day. on second call (ext 202) I get a beauty. First says he sees a digest (not even the right 1) was on order twice. I say that is not true on the invoice I received with shipment, He then says that is MY invoice (like I printed it) & doesn't agree with his. When I start reading from THEIR invoice he says that is not productive. More arrogance.

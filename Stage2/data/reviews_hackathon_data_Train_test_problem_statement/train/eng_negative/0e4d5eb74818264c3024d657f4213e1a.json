It was from Chefs Corner and was one of four restaurants that appeared in my geographical location. Not a great selection but it didn't matter so I placed my order. I received a call then about 20 minutes later from a guy at Chefs Corner telling me that I live in Glanmire and that they only deliver within 5k of wherever they are based. This is all after receiving an email confirmation (Which I have) and the money deducted from my card.\nLong story short - He was unable to deliver and asked me to contact Marvin.ie and they would sort it. By this stage it was late and there was no where else to order from. The money was refunded on Sunday to be fair. Not a great impression to be honest, there are a lot of other similar sites which offer a better service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T15:00:40.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

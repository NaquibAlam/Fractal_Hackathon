I entered my credit card details and it I APPROVED the payment of 1650EUR but my card was charged 1844EUR. How can I get charged 200EUR more than what I authorized when clicking the approved payment button?\nI called a representative straight away and they said 100EUR was because I didn't pay with a Maestro card and the other 100EUR was admin fees. He asked if I would like a refund to which I would be charged a 60EUR cancellation fee. I asked is that my only option and he said yes. I said I would have to think about it and he hung up on me.\nI am fuming!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:33:17.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

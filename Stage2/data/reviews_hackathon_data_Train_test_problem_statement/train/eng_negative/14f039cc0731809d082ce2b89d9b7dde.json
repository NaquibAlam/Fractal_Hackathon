First of all, only 6 books were delivered. Four of the paperbacks in the first 2 shipments are in poor quality. They are well worn, yellowed, and the covers are ripped or bent. The 2 books in the last shipment are in perfect condition and it is difficult to tell that they were even used at all. All of these books were purchased as a gift for my husband, so needless to say I felt a need to apologize to him. This was my first experience with Thrift Books so I'm not sure I'll take a chance again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:17:40.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They emailed me telling me that my order would be sent directly from Awatta. After a week I called Awatta directly, they told me that they had received the order but could not send it due to a reason that had to be discussed directly with Chicago airbrush.. all I know is I have a bunch of projects to complete and do not have the tools to do them.. they are happy to take your money and leave you hanging !!! They are costing me time and money, thanks a lot Chicago airbrush!!!! Your company sucks !!! The biggest group of liars I have ever dealt with!!! Wish I had read some reviews on them before ordering.... trust me on this one if you are looking to buy any form of airbrushing supplies DO NOT deal with this company!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:53:14.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

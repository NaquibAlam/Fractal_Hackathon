I've spent plenty of my lunch hours (yes sometimes a full hour!) trying to get somewhere with my query and now I wanted for someone to just ready my email and get back to me with an answer but they don't do that. They avoid getting back to you via email, so you don't have anything confirmed. When you call, everyone tells you something different and you end up with no record of what has been said by whom, when or why. I've never come a across a company that has a customer service email and doesn't reply to it. Last time I sent 5 follow up emails, asking for someone to respond, before calling and the woman on the phone said that she couldn't reply to me because she was off sick. Worst excuse I've ever heard. Like there is nobody else who monitors emails?! Like someone mentioned in their previous review, the call center has been outsourced to India and when you call up they just read from a handbook and don't care if your case gets resolved or not. I have been told several times on the phone that they are sure they will find a solution to my query and they haven't. Very bad service. Avoid at any cost and save yourself the hassle! I'm still waiting for someone to respond to my email...days and days after...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T16:41:33.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I received an email congratulating me and telling me to pack my bags. I could have booked the same flights with expedia or the airlines direct for 1033 but was happy to save the cash as I trusted the lastminute brand. This morning at 10am they emailed to say the booking was cancelled as the fare was no longer available! Of course I then checked expedia and the airline immediately and these flights are now 1500 and 1800 pounds respectively! At no point in the booking process did lastminute so much as hint that the flights may not be confirmed. I am sure it is in the 'fine print' but this should at least be nodded at when you are booking. As I was booking late I knew prices would move fast so would not have taken the chance. lastminute.com has lost me a small fortune and I will never ever even look at their their unreliable site again!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T19:13:25.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

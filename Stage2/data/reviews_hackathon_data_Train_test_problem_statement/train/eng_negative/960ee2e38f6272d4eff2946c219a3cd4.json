I told him to call me back in 1 hour as I needed to find a different flight to replace that ticket with.\nAfter an hour, he called me back and issued the cancellation. However, not one time did he mention that the refund time frame would be 6 - 8 weeks.\nI called again the next day to ask when I would receive my refund, and if it was possible to apply that credit to my future ticket which i was planning on buying for a different trip, one month from now. I was informed by someone that it would be 6 - 8 weeks and asked to talk to a supervisor. In comes Marlon.\nMarlon must have missed the customer service training module, as he outright claimed that I am lying and there is no way that Jerrick would not have informed me of the 6 - 8 weeks. While I understand that it is your policy to inform the customer, I WAS NOT INFORMED.\nMarlon did nothing to fix the problem, and just kept repeating that there is no way Jerrick would not have informed me.\nAs such, I am letting you know why I plan on never buying a ticket through your service, and I hope you get a better call centre than the one in the Philippines occupied by people who clearly don't give a crap about their job or the customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:02:47.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

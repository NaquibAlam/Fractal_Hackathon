Well i received the order in a plain box no case to it and now i can't give my gift to the person i had purchased for. I think the customer should be informed or it should say no case or something on the order. Then i called customer service and their answer was that they will check and get back to me well i am still waiting and no answer. Horrible customer service. I will never purchase here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:08:48.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Asked too much question just to purchase my ticket with my own money. they questioned me about buying a ticket for my spouse after telling them i'm buying a ticket for my husband. they asked me the last time i deposited money in my account? thats too personal. Aren't they selling? and am i not buying? i won't recommend anyone to buy their ticket with these people. this lady called Debbie, after telling her i'm grieving the death of my dad she was still rude to me and didn't give a danm about how i felt. it was too much to deal with just to get a ticket. I've purchased from so many agents and never came across something like this. this is the first time going through this. to the extent of asking for my social security and other unnecessary things that didn't pertain to me buying a ticket from them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T07:52:25.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

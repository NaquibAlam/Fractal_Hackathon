I tried paying it online but they could not confirm my card info. I did not want to call in to make the payment because I don't feel very comfortable giving financial information over the phone but had no other option. I was under the impression that the card was linked with my primary checking account so that minimum payments would be made on their own but that was not the case. I missed two payments and the total amount of fees was around $70 on a purchase of $90. The main issue is that they dinged my credit, after I had made the payment. So my complaints are the following 1. Their online payment method does not work, 2. They overcharge for missed payments and 3. They dinged my credit after I had actually made the payment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T22:06:46.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

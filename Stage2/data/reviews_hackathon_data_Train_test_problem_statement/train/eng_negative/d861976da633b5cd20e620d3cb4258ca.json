Unfortunately I was having trouble applying the Groupon code online, therefore had to call in to customer service. The first representative I spoke to said they applied the code for me and I should go online and schedule delivery/select my menu. I was able to log on to the website, but I could not select my menu options. I called back and spoke to a second representative...this time, i was told they reapplied the Groupon code, reactivated my account and I should not be able to go online and select my menu. It worked and I thought everything was fine. Then I get an email this weekend that says my delivery was unable to be processed. I called this morning and I'm being told that I can not use the Groupon since I had purchased back in October 2014 and my order has been cancelled for tomorrow's delivery. WHY WOULD NO ONE TELL ME THIS WHEN I CALLED IN TWICE BEFORE?!!! Now I'm out $60 and i will never recommend HelloFresh to anyone! the supervisor I spoke to was not even apologetic for the lack of customer service on her reps for failing to disclose this information prior. I'm going back to Blue Apron after this, should have stuck with them in the first place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:31:11.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

REALLY They never bothered to come, the lady in front of my seat was sleeping so her seat was on my knees and passenger behind me was arguing but I had paid for the seat so I pushed my seat back as well and then crew came after 2.5 hours when flight was nearly landing at London.\nThey had limited food, a passenger next to me wanted Fish (Dory) and was informed by crew that they dont have any more and passenger should wait until premium passengers finish, if anything is left then he can have it.\nI felt it was worst than easy jet. Emirates is far better airline and their services are world class.\nWill never fly again in Qantas and recommend others not to fly with them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T22:36:09.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

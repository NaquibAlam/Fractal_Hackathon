I used their calculator.shipito.com to simulate a package delivery to where I live. It worked perfectly â€“ the page gave me a lot of options and prices for delivery. So I went ahead and bought something and had it delivered to shipito. When I tried to forward the package, my country wasn't there. So I tried to forward it to another freight forwarding service, and it turns out they specifically blacklisted their postal code, even though the calculator says they can deliver there.\nI used their support chat several times and in every occasion they would disappear for 10 minutes without any reply, and in the end they couldn't help me at all, always \"escalating\" the issue to someone else. At the end I just gave up and sent it to a friend in the US.\nI am not someone who gives free advertising, but in this case I think I'm doing everyone a favor: go with myus and you'll be better off. Might not be perfect, but for sure way better than shipito.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:04:45.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I thought that I must have ordered it from somewhere else before. Well, I do a google search for plastisol 5 gallon bucket and your website shows up.\nI IMMEDIATELY call customer service to amend my order. The order went in at 3:31...my call at 3:38. I wait and wait until finally I am automatically sent to voice mail. I leave a message clearly explaining I needed to amend my order. I get a call back at 4:08 from customer service. They cannot add my order of Plastisol, which is worth $500 to my squeegee order because it has already been packed and shipped! From three different states!\nI call Bull Crap.\nI asked repeatedly to get free shipping to no avail. I want free shipping on this order because in the span of 15 minutes I ordered almost $700 dollars worth of stuff from you. I am not a guest shopper---I logged in and my address and credit card info came up immediately. If your website had been correct in the first place, none of this would have happened.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T23:15:52.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was using my phone to make the purchase and I had issues with the page refreshing and deleting information I had already entered. However, it didn't delete all the information, just some. It took about 5 tries of re-entering and getting error messages that it wasn't filled until I finally got through. In the process though, it must have taken the wrong spelling of the middle name. My phone kept auto correcting and I had to override it. I figured this shouldn't be a big deal and I would just call to get one letter changed. At first the call was going smoothly and Rem assured me that he would do everything he could to fix it. After 25 minutes on the phone he said there would be a $75 fee for changing one letter for the middle name (which is optional). I explained to him my situation multiple times and he kept cutting me off. I felt like he wasn't even listening which made me angry. He also kept asking me to prove how the website wasn't working which wasn't reasonable. After talking to West Jet and Air Canada (those were the airlines we booked with), they said there wouldn't be a fee. I was very frustrated with the whole experience and I will not be booking with Flight Hub in the future nor will I be recommending it. It was a very negative experience.\nUpdate: I just received a call from Flight Hub. I thought it was a great that they were getting back to me. They left a number to call back which I did. Denise took the call and she had no idea what was going on and was not able to provide any help. This call wasted another 10 minutes and still did not solve any problems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:10:37.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

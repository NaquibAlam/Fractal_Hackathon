A few weeks later I got an email from bravofly a few weeks prior to my trip saying the airline had cancelled one of the legs of my return flight. I called the airline and this was not the case, turns out Bravofly did not book this. I have been going back and forth with bravofly to get an alternate return ( including different routes) and they continue to respond with the same generic email only giving me the option to return to Miami two days after my booked flight. There are plenty of other options they can provide me with but they aren't. If you need a reliable plan with a set return flight by a certain date, save yourself a headache and book with someone else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:05:01.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

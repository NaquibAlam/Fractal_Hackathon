I noticed that my husbands flight was taking a while to be confirmed. Turned out they'd actually cancelled it without notifying us. The reason they claim is because we had a special request which we hadn't responded to. We had actually responded to their email immediately and had screenshots of the conversation to show we had replied within 10mins of receiving theirs. They admitted it was their fault. However we still see no resolution. They haven't re-instated the flight and in the time we've waited for them to keep messing us around (over 5hours clocked to their premium phone number), the flights have increased by £500. Promises to resolve the situation and calling us back have not yet happened. We have spent an inordinate time trying to get answers from them and keep getting fobbed off. Absolutely awful company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:55:23.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

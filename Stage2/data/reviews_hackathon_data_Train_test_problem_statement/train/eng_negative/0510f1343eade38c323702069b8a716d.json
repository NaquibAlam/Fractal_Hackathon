We booked with them as we have used them previously with no issues. As all other reviews say, they took payment as soon as you press buy on their website but then you receive a booking request email and are asked to wait up to 48 hours for this to be confirmed. It has been longer than this for me and I have still not had my booking confirmed.\nUnfortunately our booking is actually very last minute as we booked for a package next week. I have rang customer service twice now to see if the booking will be confirmed or not as if it will be cancelled then I will just book with someone else. However, the customer service team has no power and cannot give you a straight answer other than \"to just wait longer\" for someone else to apparently contact you. Yesterday I was promised that someone would email me by the end of the day \"as a matter of high priority\". Today I was promised someone would contact me by noon \"as a matter of high priority\". The customer service line seems highly scripted with the operators saying whatever you want to hear to get you off the line. The operators seem like they couldn't care less about the fact that their company has broken trading standards by using false advertisement and when speaking to customer service they have never once apologised for the situation lastminute has caused me to be in.\nLastminute is disgraceful for customer service and I would never ever use them again. I don't think they realise that people have lives and don't have the time to sit around ringing them up for days trying to chase a holiday booking which should be easy enough to confirm. With any luck they wont confirm my booking so I never have to have any dealings with them again.\nTLDR: DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T16:04:53.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

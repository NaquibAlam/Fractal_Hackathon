I decided I wasn't happy with a great some of it, did the online form, printed labels shipped it back. Never got credit or Merchandise returned, when i inquire they said we are sorry you have exceeded you return rate limit, and your account has been suspended no further returns or refunds can be made. They refuse to return calls or emails, right now this past point of bad business, this is theft. I've not only contacted the BBB, but the St Louis Police dept as well, it's well over $1000 dollars. Of my money and merchandise.\nIf they have a return rate limit:\n1. it needs to be implied in their policy, that they reserve the right to limit. (Implying a limit would hamper sales)\n2. They make good on the business and their return policy, they have done with the customer, and stop doing business with them going forward, if they deem them as a problem. They don't get to do it midstream without returning merchandise or refunding money, Very bad business", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:05:50.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

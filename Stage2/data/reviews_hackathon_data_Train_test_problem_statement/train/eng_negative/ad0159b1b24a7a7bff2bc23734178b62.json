Had booked up several flights for a trip to Bologna. Flights competitively priced& everything seemed A-ok, till friend asked to be added to trip. Couldn't get seat on same flight back, so booked later flight, HOWEVER, after booking confirmation email showed me to have booked a flight with an 18 hour stopover in Amsterdam, not the 4 hours, or so, I had booked!\nI immediately attempted to contact eDreams by their number 0333 300 0297. I phoned frequently and at length, sometines holding, listening to stupid music for an hour. I also used the facebook messenger link, which said \"Typically replies instantly.\" - It never replied at all. Totally wasted one day, though having done google searches on the company, my heart sank, when I see the multiple and severe complaints about them.\nNext day couldn't phone as I was on a hill walk all day. Then, yesterday, I phoned and phoned again, then suddenly to my amazement got an answer from a lady called Shradha. Things did improve a bit after this point. I explained the situation. She said she would check with the carrier - no chance of amending flight. Refund for cancelling, would almost be wiped out by cancellation charge. At least she was friendly, calm and did a little to help. I knew I was on a loser despite being certain, the flight they 'booked' for me, was not the flight I booked, if you know what I mean. She did agree, that best idea might be to keep flights as far as Amsterdam, then book new flight from there, which is to cost an extra Â£50. She also explained there is a claim form, which I should fill in. I do not expect a slim dime back, despite this not being my mistake.\nShe also, checked my previous booking and reassured me everything with them is 100% ok, definately all booked.\nSo, what can I advise? Well, I am at least a bit more reassured about our other flights, but to be honest, think things still could go wrong so will be praying, with fingers crossed and carrying lucky white heather, till we are home. Thanks eventually to Shradha for little help, but I presume you must be the only person who works in the department. Sorry, but have to score eDeams as minus five star and in honesty, would not recommend anyone to take a chance with them, despite the attraction of a cheaper deal!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T14:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T21:11:16.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

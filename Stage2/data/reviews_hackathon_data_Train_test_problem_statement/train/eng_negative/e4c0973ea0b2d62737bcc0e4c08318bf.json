They sent an inspector out and determined that the floor was milled improperly and that's why the floor was squeaking, and the delaminating of the floor was obvious. The salesman from Build Direct asked what I thought would be fair and I told him I would get back to him. I emailed him a week later and I apologized for taking so long to get back but I was waiting back from an installer to figure out how much it would cost to tear out the existing floor and install the new one. At that point the salesman told me that they wouldn't pay for the labor and that it was standard for them to only cover the cost of the floor. If that was standard then why did they ask what I thought was fair? Were they hoping I would ask for less than the cost of the floor? I then talked to the inspector and the owner of the inspection company and they both said that the flooring company typically pays for the labor and flooring and they weren't sure why Build Direct was arguing with me. I then talked to the sales manager and told him what the inspector said. He then called the inspector and then called me back and said that the inspector told him something totally different. So I called the inspector back and he said that the sales manager wasn't being truthful and that he didn't want to deal with Build Direct and he was frustrated with the situation they were trying to put him in. A few months ago I told the salesman from Build Direct to just sent the check for the floor and I would take them to court for the rest and let the court decide who was responsible for the labor costs. Since then the salesperson has completely disappeared. I called the sales manager and I received an email saying this...\nWe are currently in the process of considering your latest correspondence and someone from BuildDirect will be back in touch with you shortly.\nThat was on March 7th. I left a voicemail with him on the third. I emailed him again on the 17th to see where they were at with this and I still haven't heard anything and it's March 22.\nIn my email to him I told him that the corners that are delaminating are sharp and my 4 year old daughters sock was caught and ripped by the sharp edge. I have then tried to use duct tape to tape down all of the corners that are delaminating because they are sharp enough to cut a bare foot.\nThis has been an extremely frustrating experience and the people from Build Direct have done nothing but try to point fingers to distract from the actual problems and deny responsibility.\nI think it says a lot when the inspection company that was hired by Build Direct has recommended to me to take Build Direct to court and they would be happy to help me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:51:07.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After over a month I contacted support and they said I had to wait till Feb 8th to verify that it doesn't show up. This is after a mess with them giving me a tracking number but saying there is no tracking for the item (which made no sense at all). I gave it the full amount of time for the item to show up but after contacting them again, they are trying to blame the shipping company and want me to repay for the item or give me a coupon for another order.\nI would stay far away from this site.

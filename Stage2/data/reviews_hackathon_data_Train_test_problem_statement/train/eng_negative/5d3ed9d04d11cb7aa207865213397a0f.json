The furniture we have got was broken on arrival, and had to be exchanged twice after initial delivery within the first month. It is now broken again and the company no longer makes it due to frequent failures. Jeff, the corporate head of customer support, was very rude and unhelpful, which explains why I had issues at the store as well. The best offer for resolution I got was a $50 gift certificate that expired in 6 months from date of issue.\nI will never do business with Gardner-White again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:18:08.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

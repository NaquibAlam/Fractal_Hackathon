They said ships in 3-5 days. A week goes by and I don't hear anything or get any communication. I reach out to customer service and after another 48hours I finally get a response saying boots are not available. They billed my credit card as soon as the order was placed, yet took over a week to say they can't fill the order. Terrible online experience compared to other online merchants. They then offered a substitute which wasn't as good of a boot or deal, I said yes anyway immediately as my options were limited as inventory was more picked over. The next email from them was another apology saying the substitute they promised is no longer available. Now their offer was an even inferior boot to their substitute and was going to cost me 25% more $ than the original pair I ordered. Terrible experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T07:40:42.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

No issues. However, I had a major issue when I went to print my tickets.... I purchased the tickets in November. The day of the concert in February, I tried to print the tickets but found that I didn't have an email to print them. I logged in to my account and it said the tickets were available but I was unable to print them. I called ticket city only to find out that my tickets I purchased were not honored by the seller Ticket city apologized for not notifying me but had I not called them, they would've never told me!!!! In November they charged my credit card and sent me a confirmation number and said they would send me the tickets when they became available. Somehow my account said they were available but obviously they weren't. It was all to confusing and almost ruined my trip.

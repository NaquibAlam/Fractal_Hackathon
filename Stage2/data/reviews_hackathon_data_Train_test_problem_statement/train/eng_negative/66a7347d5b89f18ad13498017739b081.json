Two were 3.59 and one was 5.06. The two books were in way better condition than the 5.06 one. The 5.06 one had loads of markings on it and the thriftbooks sticker tore off some of the side. Meanwhile, the other two books had minimal wear. It bums me out because I was really excited for the 5.06 one. I find it to be unfair that the cheaper books were in better condition than the 5.06 when one of the cheaper ones said it was in acceptable condition while the 5.06 was said to be in good condition. I would have been okay with this if the thriftbooks sticker didn't ruin the side of the book. I'm going to shop on other sites from now on :/", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:50:41.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Therefore not being at home on the 14th. I tried to ring the company to either cancel or change the address/date of delivery. I spent 20 mins on hold, gave up and contacted them my email. I received an email later that day stating it's a busy time so no amendments/refund (even with 4 days notice). In today's world of IT and management systems you would think a company would have the ability to track and amend orders as necessary. So no refund, no amendments what a waste of money.

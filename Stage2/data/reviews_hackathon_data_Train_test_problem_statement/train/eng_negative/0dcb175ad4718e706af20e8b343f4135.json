When they arrived, I really did not like them, felt they were to big, (my fault) and I felt the bifocal was a little to high. Decided to take advantage of their 30 warranty and send them back for an exchange. Got my return number and proceeded to remove the glasses from my head and the right arm snapped in to. Now I have been wearing this frame for years with no problems and I don't think I was aggressive in removing them. So I called right away and was told that my account was noted and send them back. I sent them back, took forever, I called and a lady said that the came in and were inspected and they were found to have been man handled (my word) and the warranty was void, did they ever think, could it possible be a bad frame ?. So I asked that they not send them back and have someone call me on Monday to discuss. No one every called, they were shipped back to me. Someone could have called to make an offer to at least fix them, but no. About a week after receiving them I got an email offering to fix them at my cost. By this time I had ordered a part from someone else. I sent a email with my issues and have yet to here back.

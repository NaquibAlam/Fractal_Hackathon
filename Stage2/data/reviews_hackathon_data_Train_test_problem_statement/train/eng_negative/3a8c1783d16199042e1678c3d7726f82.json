I know this doesn't seem much, but when they are designed to fit the UPVC frame of the window, it really makes a difference.\nAfter breaking one of the brackets on the one blind, trying to force it into position, I spoke to customer services who agreed to replace the bracket. I managed to squeeze the 2nd blind into position by cutting away some of the rubber between the UPVC and the glass (which isn't ideal), but have still not received the replacement bracket I was promised so am unable to fit the second blind.\nTo make matters worse, my emails are now being ignored.\nIt's a shame because we have previously used Blinds2Go for household blinds and were considering these EasyFIT blinds for our conservatory but after this, I shan't be using Blinds2Go again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:42:42.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

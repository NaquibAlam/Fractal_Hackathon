On chat they explained that they woudl give me a different download link for the template. To make matters worse, they gave me a configuration for the php.ini file that did not allow their own template to be uploaded. After several changes via the hosting partner bluehost (also suggested by template monster as a partner) funny they take 5 hours to answer a ticket!!!\nI finally used the web to figure out how to upload the template directly onto my new hosting service. the new template was extracted and lo and behold it need plugins that just dont seem to get installed!\nWhen I contacted the chat channel on template monster Ivy informs me that I shoudl try re-uploading the template manually and that the issue needs time. Oops! it is their policy to frustrate you for 36 hours so you can buy their installation package where they would not misguide themselves on the mess they create.,\nWhen I asked for my money back they said they would arrange a call back in 3 hours!!! Its 1:20 a.m. in India and he/she expects me to be awake to listen to their garbage about how pathetic their service can get and can get worse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T06:42:30.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

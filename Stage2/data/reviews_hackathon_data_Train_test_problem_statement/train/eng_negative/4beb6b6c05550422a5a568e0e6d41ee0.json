I was offered an alternative hotel which I had to accept or be issued with a refund ( I was travelling with my elderly Aunt and could not risk having no accommodation). The Hotel itself was nice but double bed only, a 10-15 minute walk from the water bus and over a mile away from the Hotel we wanted.\nOverall a very stressfull start to our visit - I would not risk booking with Trivago/amoma again.\nAll of our travel plans from the airport etc. were turned upside down.\nThe reason we were given for the change in Hotel was refurbishment, I called in to the Hotel we should have been staying in and there was no sign of any refurbishment taking place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:50:56.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

For me as a complete newbie to road cycling, it was a rather unpleasant experience and I would not recommend it. You risk a number of unpleasant surprises (see below). My advice would be to go to your local dealer, get advice and support and maybe buy spares and accessories at Wiggle.\nWhy?\n- First and foremost YOU HAVE TO PAY IMPORT TAX on you purchase if itÂ´s more than minor bits and pieces. Ordering a bike is impossible without customs. This should be clearly stated in the wiggle pricing. I had no clue of that as I ordered on an Australian site and got a price in Australian dollars. How should I know that they ship from Britain? That is hidden very well in the fine print. I gotta say that aspect is close to scam.\n- The returns policy is very tempting \"No sweat! You can return it for a full refund or exchange\", everything sounds super easy and guess what, the written returns policy fails to mention that you have to pay for the return postage. You have to watch the embedded video to hear that. And that video starts with the same words as the written policy, so why would you watch it? Ordering for the first time, I ordered a couple of things in different sizes as I need to try, and guess what none of them fitted and I paid big dollars to send all that back (to NSW).\n- Being new to all I ordered a set of pedals (SPD) and shoes (SPD-SL/SPD) that didn't work together as it turned out that the SPD-SL/SPD shoes needed a special adapter to be used with SPD even though they were specified as SPD compatible. Wiggle doesn't sell that adaptor and a local dealer found out for me that it doesn't exist in OZ. Yes, this is due my lack of knowledge / experience but some more use guidance could maybe help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:10:44.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

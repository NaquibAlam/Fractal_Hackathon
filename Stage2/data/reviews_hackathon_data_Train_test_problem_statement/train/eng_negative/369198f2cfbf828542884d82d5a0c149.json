It's a real site. However, the host I stayed with was seriously frightening. despite the fact that he had positive reviews. He posted a picture on his website of himself with his wife, implying he had a family, but repeatedly talked about his divorce while I was visiting, and behaved threateningly towards my wife. She asked me not to leave a bad review for him (as he had some personal information) but I eventually decided I should leave one. The host replied on the site by calling my wife a prostitute and posting where I worked (unfortunately, I had told him) and literally threatening to come and assault me at work. I contacted homestay.com about this, and their response was to *remove my review*! I guess that explains why they have terribly hosts with positive reviews! Definitely don't trust any reviews from guests on this forum-- they don't care.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T01:40:31.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

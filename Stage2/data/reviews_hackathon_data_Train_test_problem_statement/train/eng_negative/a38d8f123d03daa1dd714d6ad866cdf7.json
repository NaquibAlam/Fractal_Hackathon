Got a good price including 2 cases in the price. All got confirmed whit a mail only in Swedish.\nThought it could be some difficulties with that if it would be any problems.\nI mean I can read Swedish but wery few in the rest of the world.\nOf course it got troubles. We got a mail from Bravofly.se saying that the luggage wasn't included in the price. They also had a solution for the problem, written in Swedish. They also claimed that it is a \"system failure\", well I have heard that story before.\nWill be \"fun\" to see the Thai airport staff read Swedish. This means, probably, that the solution will end up in our wallet.\nTried to get in contact with their customer's service whitout any results.\nSo next time you are making a booking, put a little more money on that, and it will avoid problems and Bravofly.se.\n/Danne51", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:37:14.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

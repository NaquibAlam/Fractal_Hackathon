The problems began when the courier company did not make the delivery but updated online that they had attempted to make a delivery but no-one was at home. As there were four adults in the house at the supposed time of 'attempted' delivery and we had just taken delivery of something from another supplier, I immediately informed PhysioRoom about this. Then started an almost comical scenario where PhysioRoom told me to contact the courier, Hermes. direct and Hermes claimed that I had to direct any complaints through the retailer. After wasting way too much time going backwards and forwards, the goods were finally delivered 3 days after the order had been placed - but too late for the physiotherapy session that had been scheduled!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T07:36:23.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It arrived with 3 large tears around the edge. When I contacted the company and ask they send a new and undamaged unit, their response was to put gaffer tape on it, which I could order on their website (?!?).\nAfter my disbelief with their response made way for outrage, I emailed again. This time they said I could send it back after which they would send another unit.\nWhen I didn't get any response after having sent back the damaged unit and checked where its was, it turned out to be in a local Auspost depot 2km from BackdropSource's location. Apparently, no-one was around when they came by to deliver it. But BackdropSource didn't want to pick it up at the depot and told me to contact Auspost and have them deliver it to them.\nAgain, in total disbelief I emailed again and asked for them to pick it up 2km away and send me the new unit. After that I finally received a new undamaged green screen. The whole process has taken more than 6 weeks. Very poor service and return policy. Don't order from BackdropSource!!!\nAll I can say is these sorts of companies will be out of business very soon once Amazon lands in Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T05:57:54.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

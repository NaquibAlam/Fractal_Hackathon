In that email it says: \"You made the smart, simple choice when you selected auto-renew. The following domains will renew automatically on the dates listed below. All that's left to do is enjoy your purchase.\"\nGoDaddy even did not try to charge my credit card to renew that domain name but they charged the same card for two other domain names few days before and after that date. Without no other warnings or email sent, they removed my domain name from my account because they had already received an offer from someone else.\nWhen I called their support they said they could help negotiating to buy it back from the new owner ( thieves in my opinion ).\nI had 30 domain names registered with them, now 29. I will move them all away from this company with such low ethics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T15:46:35.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

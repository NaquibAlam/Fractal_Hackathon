I had lens replacement surgery in July 2016. After 2 weeks I developed a problem and was sent to Leeds then Manchester to have further surgery. After taking time off work to attend these appointments I was informed nothing could be done for 3 months and they didn't know why I had been sent there. I have been advised to buy glasses from the pound shop 3 times. After spending over Â£5000 to not wear glasses I really don't feel this is appropriate advice. I have now had YAG laser surgery although at my last appointment in Leeds there was no record of this and it said left eye no surgery on the computer screen. Record keeping and communication between clinics obviously isn't a priority as I have also been told twice that appointments need to be paid for even though I am still in aftercare period. I have twice been told I need laser surgery but then nothing has been done. My eyesight is now worse than before surgery. Optical Express say 20:20 vision or your money back. I have not got 20:20 vision and I think it's a fair bet I won't get my money back either. So in conclusion would I recommend surgery? That has to a be personal decision after weighing up the risks. Would I recommend Optical Express? That unfortunately has to be a resounding NO. It would appear that as long as surgery goes well then the service provided is good. If problems develop then Optical Express simply do not want to know.\nEdit. Interesting to note that there has been no response to this review!\nI have tried to phone clinical services but no answer. I had to use the online text service and request a call back. To be fair they did then call back within 2 hours. I am now waiting for a review by the consultant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:26:34.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

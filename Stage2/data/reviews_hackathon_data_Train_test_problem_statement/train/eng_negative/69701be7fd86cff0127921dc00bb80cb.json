You pay an additional 10$ for this and the symbol came out horrible. You can't even see what it is. I would have sent it back but they don't allow you to if it was engraved which is ridiculous if the engraving came out with poor quality. You cannot even tell what it is. I should have went with something more solid like a star. It says my first name, caduceus, then last name. The symbol just looks like a random engravement. To pay close to 200$ for something just to find the engravement to come out so poorly, maybe I should have purchased from one of the more expensive web sites. The stethoscope itself is fine but again, I spent this much in a stethoscope because I plan to have it for years now with very poor engraving. And also know what you want before hand. They do not let you return engraved items. So this stethoscope works great but it is extremely heavy and bothers my neck so be mindful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T22:40:38.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

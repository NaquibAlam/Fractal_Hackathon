Ltd where I met Rita. She was very friendly, responded quickly and was sure to answer any questions. Long and short I am a retailer and was sourcing some stock for my start-up and they had some rather hip designs advertised on their site. I order several pieces to sample the garments which arrived timely. The first alarm that went off was, for the number of pieces I ordered they did not come in a box but in a large plastic envelope. The designs looked nothing like the photos and worse the fabric that was meant to be a 60% cotton 40% polyester blend was the cheapest fabric I had ever seen. I could see right through the garments and they were so light it was frightening. If heat went anywhere near the fabric it singed/shrunk like foam. I ordered several samples of hoodies and joggers and for them to fit in the envelope in which they arrived, was indicative of the synthetic fabric the company was passing off as a Poly/cotton blend. When I contacted Ritar to let her know that I received the items and of my disappointment she told I should have ordered 100% cotton. Now I do know that some big box establishment sell joggers with less that 60% cotton and their quality was superior to what I got so I am very sure they lied about the blend. She then had the gall to ask me if I wanted to go ahead with the big order vs. how would you like your refund? I was never refunded!! Please buyers beware of this company with their Low MOQ and SHODDY GARMENTS!! HORRIBLE and WASTE OF MONEY!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T18:25:49.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

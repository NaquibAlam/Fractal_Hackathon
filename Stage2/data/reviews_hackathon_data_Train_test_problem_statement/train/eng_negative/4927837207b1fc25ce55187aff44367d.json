We ordered the standard foundation with our new mattress but when delivered, it was much too big. I asked the delivery team how I can exchange for the low profile base and was directed to call the store to make arrangements. When I called the store I left a message because they were busy with a sale. I was told I'd receive a call back same day. I did not receive a call until closing the next evening. At that time I was told I should have rejected the delivery and now I was responsible for delivery fee and an additional fee for the different foundation. I called back later to try to speak with someone that may be more accommodating since the delivery team told me to call the store. I ended up agreeing to the $100 swap fee but the store covered the delivery fee but I had to wait until the following weekend. The following weekend they brought the wrong foundation so having learned from previously, I rejected it and called the store again. Left a message again to receive a call back the next evening... Again... To be given apologies and another auto-schedule for the following weekend. (This now makes 3 weeks from purchase). I was told due to the inconveniences I would be an early morning delivery but received an estimated time for late afternoon. I ended up not being home when delivery showed up an hour later than window provided. I called and was scheduled again for early morning Sunday only to receive an estimated time for mid afternoon. I called immediately to inform them I would not be home due to other commitments to be told I'd be added to the next truck departure in the evening. I asked for an actual person to call me with my time frame to NOT receive one. I called them at 3pm to be told I would not receive a phone call from a person but the autodialer would reach out. I tried to explain my circumstances but was dismissed.\nNow after over 3 weeks later, I have just received my correct foundation at 6pm in the evening. never received my personal phone call but only the autodialer. Bottom line, I would not recommend Gardner White on the sole reason of poor follow up customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:39:52.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

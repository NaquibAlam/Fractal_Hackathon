They never pick up the phone, reply on e-mails with one line, where half the content is “Sorry for any inconvenience. Please contact us if you have any questions.”. I have spent over 1000 USD with them, and several of my friends moved to them on my recommendation. It seems like I am done now with them. I will look for other options where staff actually helps. I asked them to refund me at least some part of the cost, and they have bluntly refused to even acknowledge my question.\nTo top up, if I pay for 3 - 6 business days, I expect them to live up to this and either refund or do something else. I will now share this with those who I recommended your company too and will look for alternatives.\nParcel number U20170131727128 stuck with USPS for 9 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:02:40.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

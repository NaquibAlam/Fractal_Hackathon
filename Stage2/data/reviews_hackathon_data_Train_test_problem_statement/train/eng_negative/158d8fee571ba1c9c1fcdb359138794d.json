It would have to be Monday deliver. So he upgraded my simple bouquet order to 2 dozen assorted roses (red, pink, white and yellow) at no charge. Then he called back after i agreed to Monday and said now it was pushed until Tuesday.\nSo the roses arrived on Tuesday and the receiver sent me a picture. Not one RED rose in the bunch. But a bunch of white, a couple pink and a couple peach. UGLIEST FLOWERS ARRANGEMENT I HAVE EVER SEEN! I will never order from this company again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:45:49.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

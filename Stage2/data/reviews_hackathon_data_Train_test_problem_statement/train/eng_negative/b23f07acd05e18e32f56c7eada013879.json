It is you as a customer to shop and make sure that you have the price you want. As per our cancellation policy, we do have a charge to cancel of 75$ when you book on Flighthub.com, as you know. I understand that it is not convenient for you, but at the mean time, you booked without knowing our policy. It is your responsability as a consumer to get the information about our rules and policies to cancel and change flights, to make sure you are aware about the conditions of your purchase.\"\nThe agent said she could cancel my reservation and book the one at the lower cost but it would cost be $75! How can you even offer that to a client knowing that it will cost you more by following her suggestion.\nI have researched this company after this experience, they have been rated F by the BBB and their accreditation has been revoked!

Once you took away flowers with a cake back and left a note, that we can take our package on the next day (FLOWERS and CAKE!!!!). Of course you didn't refund it. Today you took back to the post office my amazon package and didn't leave any note. I've found it out online (without the address of the post office!)\nIn my opinion the only way to avoid such problems is to use another company (for ex. Hermes) . Thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:00:18.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

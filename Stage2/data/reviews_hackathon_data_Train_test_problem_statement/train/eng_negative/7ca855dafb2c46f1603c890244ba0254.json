I have been using Hobbyking.com for 15 years without problems. I have also used dealextreme in the past no problems. In December 2016 I ordered from banggood, gearbest and tomtop all in the same week. I am not a picky person, just get me my items I paid for and work decently. Banggood and Gearbest took 3-6 weeks to get me all of my items. I luckily only ordered one item from tomtop and it has yet to even be shipped! I have sent two dozen emails, not one response. I sent an email every day for two weeks, no response. I am now disputing with paypal.

I've used Snapfish quite a few times in the past for photo prints and photo books and have always been really impressed with the end product so I expected the calendar to be the same. However the print quality is very poor, the photos are grainy and dark and the text on the calendar (dates) aren't crisp or sharp and instead it looks like it's been done on a poor quality printer. I'm so disappointed with this. We've had photo calendars before from other companies and they've been brilliant, in comparison this calendar is awful and I've been put off using Snapfish in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:22:04.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

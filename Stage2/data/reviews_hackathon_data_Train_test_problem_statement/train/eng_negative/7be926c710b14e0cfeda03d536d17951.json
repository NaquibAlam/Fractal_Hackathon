HE DID NOT EVEN KNOCK on my door !!!! and i'm pregnant, how am i suppose to go pick my heavy item up now.... i thank you for your lazy employees! i called purolator right away to see if they can send the driver back asap because he obviously inst doing his job, but they cant do this, so now i have to take another day off and hope that the delivery guy knows how to use his hands for actually knocking on a door. meanwhile my rocking chair is most likely being tossed around who knows where getting damaged!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:31:36.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

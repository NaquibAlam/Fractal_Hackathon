Arrived at the hotel after an 8 hour motorcycle ride. It was 4:35 EST (So I did not receive the calls or emails)\n2.

Got on their computer and saw an email that said go to the Holiday Inn resort. The clerk acknowledge that all the people were going there….\n4. It takes about 45 minutes to get there. Due to the motorcycle event.\n5. We get there and they have no rooms. They call another Holiday Inn even further. And they are holding two rooms and we had twenty minutes to get there…\n6. We make it. But had to pay again at a higher rate!\n7. We ended up paying you, Holiday Inn and are now 10 miles from the event.

After a call, when I was able to schedule a date (through an automated process), they were unable to make the delivery but failed to contact me. I had to again contact them questioning why I had received the night-before call.\nWhen I called, they made me feel that I was wrong (luckily I had an email confirming the date) and said they could not possibly make that date, and it had to be changed. As it turns out, the item had been put on the wrong truck.\nWhenever I called MXD, I was consistently on hold for 20-30 mintues before anyone would take the call, then would be switched around between people. One time I was put on hold (for another 20 min) and the girl was surprised I was still there when she picked up the phone. I truely think she was hoping I had hung up.\nThe customer service MXD showed was unbelievably horrible. All they needed to do was to stay in touch with me and let me know the problems they were encountering. But no one did. I may not have been happy that the delivery ended up being 3 weeks late, but would have appreciated the customer service.\nThe day of the delivery went fine. The gentlemen were nice and took the cabinet up to a second floor room, which was quite a struggle.\nTruthfully, I will question ordering from OFL again, not because of the company or products, but because I do not want to go through the delivery struggle again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:42:33.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

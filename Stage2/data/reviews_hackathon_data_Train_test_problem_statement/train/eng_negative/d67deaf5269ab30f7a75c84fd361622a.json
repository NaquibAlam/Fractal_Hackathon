I send money over and i am cancelled for every other transaction within two minutes of first being approved.\nNow i am talking very small amounts of money here maybe $150.00-250.00 per month. I do not take a chance and I do bank wires for the larger amounts needed for the beginning of the school terms. Even though that costs me $35.00 and a much lower exchange rate. If they denied a measly $175.00 i know they will not approve $900.00.\nThere are ALWAYS emergencies popping up with young college kids so sometimes it does not just fit into sending money once per month.\nJ Sanders", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T19:47:21.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

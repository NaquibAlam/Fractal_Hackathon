Downloaded all paperwork from DVLA as requested and had two forms of identity. Drove the 35 miles to pickup the booked vehicle only to be informed that I required two official documents with my address on it but my driving licence would not count. Paid £3.50 for my address to be confirmed by Car Hire labs. Next I was told my 'deal' was only third party insurance and if I wanted fully comprehensive it would be triple what the car hire was. When saying no thank you., I was told that my access would therefore be £1300 which had to be blocked on my card up front. At this point I declined the rental leaving without my much needed hire, £10 out of pocket and wasting 2 hours of my time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:03:49.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

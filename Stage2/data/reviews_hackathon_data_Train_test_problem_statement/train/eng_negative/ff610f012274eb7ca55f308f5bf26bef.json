Expected next day delivery and item never arrived. Upon phoning customer services, they advised that the order was in dispute due to an incorrect discount code being applied. This was the first time that they had notified me of this, yet had confirmed the purchase via email and proceeded to debit the funds from my account. Their error (somehow) was implied to be my fault, and they would only release for dispatch should I pay the difference. After getting nowhere with customer services, i asked to speak to a manager, to which they refused. Poor standards of customer service which no acknowledgement of their error. I'd advise against using this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:47:52.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The experience at the onset all through the shipment arriving at the Chennai Port was seamless and very positive.\nHowever when my goods were delivered to my residence in Mumbai, I found 2 of my valuables (DSLR Camera and Laptop) missing from the packages. I inquired with Universal and they were baffled since the items in question were examined by the Customs and I was charged Excise duty on the same for which a receipt was also provided.\nUniversal accepted that the items were stolen/misplaced either at their Warehouses or during transit to Mumbai and re-directed me to the Insurance claim process - the Insurance company refused to pay stating they cover only full damages to the shipment in event of a catastrophe or damage but do not cover partial loss.\nIts very sad that such information about Insurance is not provided upfront to the customer and Universal being a reputed company does not even make an effort to make good the loss for a customer. All calls to Universal representatives have fallen on deaf ears.\nI would not recommend Universal Relocations to any of my friends or other folks looking for professional movers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:53:28.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I've bought a 10$ gift card for PS4. I 'm from Argentina and when I introduce the code it says that the code I enter is not available for my region. That's the problem I have. The thing is that nowhere in the page say that the code is only for one specific region. So I have 10$ that I can not spend. If there is a solution for my problem please contact me.\nthanks", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T16:21:23.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

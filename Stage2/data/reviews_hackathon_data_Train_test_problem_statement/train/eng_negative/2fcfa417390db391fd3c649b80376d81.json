I checked daily their website and it seems that the availability date is constantly changing. A day ago this armchair was available and ready to be shipped, today it says it will be available from some future date. The same confusion subsisted when I paid for my purchase more than 3 weeks ago.\nI have been scammed a couple of months ago by Wallace Sacks who went bust (see also reviews on Trustpilot, they were rated 8.7/10 when I paid more than Â£1000 for a couple of armchairs - they have zero ratings now), and is currently under administration due to mainly the lack of stock. I just hope Modecor will not become the villain too.\nNot really happy with the delay in the delivery of my armchair from Modecor. The costumer service only told me that they'd deliver last Monday, it's now Saturday, and they still haven't replied to may email returning a tracking number, let alone delivering my purchase.\nVery dissatisfied costumer. Think twice before buying anything from Modecor. Check that they have stock at least. Don't buy in advance.\nI would be happy to add more *stars* to my review should I receive my chair or be contacted by the costumer service with a plausible explanation for the delay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:33:45.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

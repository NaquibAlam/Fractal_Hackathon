It happened to me twice in the past year and my reviews were not published. Although l've had no other problems with their services at all l think it is only fair to let people know about the fastidious bed bugs. I am one of the 30% of the population who gets a horrible reaction from these creatures' bites and l find it that hostels are not taking this increasing problem seriously. Hostelworld.com making alowance for such hostels only makes it worse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T19:05:49.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They charge for a missing parking ticket @ krakow airport. There was no instruction for this parking ticket in advance (so how to know what to do with this). But because of logic thinking I did return this parking ticket, together with the keys. But there was no one @ the Enterprise desk, to receive the car keys, and check this parking ticket.\n30,- euros were charged on my creditcard because they say it was not there. And despite many e-mails to the service desk of Rental cars and their partner Enterprise my complaint gets no response, and is being denied.

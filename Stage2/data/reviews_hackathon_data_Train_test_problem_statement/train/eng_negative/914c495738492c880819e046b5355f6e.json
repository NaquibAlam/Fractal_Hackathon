I’ve ordered a couple of times from websites in the US and Shipito sent my packages just fine. Last week I made a new purchase, using exactly the same Visa Debit Card I used for my past transactions (and of course making sure I had enough on my bank account for the transaction) but I couldn’t make a deposit since Shipito system keeps failing. I raise a ticket and contacted customer service who told me that their IT team was looking into it and that I needed to provide a copy of my ID since they have changed their payment method (in the meantime I purchased a couple of items on Amazon with the same debit card and the transaction went just fine). The very next day trying to log into my Shipito account I realized that my login was not working, I contacted Shipito customer support and they told me that I needed to contact their supervisor which I did by sending an email and got the following reply “Please note that the ID that you have sent is a fake ID, and Shipito has a zero tolerance policy for such behavior and therefore we are not able to reopen the account. In order to get the package out of your account I will need you to have the merchant contact us to retrieve the package. Regards, Mariana G.”\nI am not a fraud and my ID has been delivered to me in hand by the French Authorities and I really cannot accept to be call a “fraud”.\nThose people at Shipito are really arrogant and rude and decided based on I don’t know which method that my ID was a fake one (so if I had a fake ID, how come I manage to get the ESTA document authorizing me to enter the US for the last couple of years? How come the Israeli custom let me enter Israel a couple of times in the past?\nShipito (a tiny winy little website) has such a great ID scamming tool that they should probably consider to sell it to other Big Players such as Amazon or even to Governments in order to reduce their so called “fraud” to ZERO", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:09:16.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

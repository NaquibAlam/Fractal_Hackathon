After 2 working weeks (10-12 days) and a considerable amount of money spent to contact the ireland-based costumer care I have been told to relax and wait for the transfer of my balance €719 to my new PayPal account, fully verified and open under my real name. Mind you, this account is the one I opened around 2012 before moving to a foreign country and, complaining with the terms of use, opening a new account there (Slovenia). After another 3 days I received the standard mail that explained to me the total blockage of my money and presented my a request for a proof of address (that has been provided 3 times, using a phone bill, a ID card and a utility bill). Still, probably I will have to wait the customary 180 days. My small business is ruined and I am seriously disappointed. They didn't even release my credit card. I tried to be cooperative and to atone for my original mistake about the artist name (fake name for paypal) to no avail. It seems they almost enjoy seeing people struggle against their draconian set of rules only because, located in Luxembourg, they are protected under certain laws. (Freezing money is apparently legal in the small landlocked country).\nPlease, don't use PayPal. Transfer your money frequently. Treat them as the con corporation they actually are. Don't trust what they tell you.\nIt is an uphill battle.\nNext time, I will be as criminal so they are considering me, moving my money out as soon as the first notification about reaching the limit hit me. And I will close the account.\nAs I guess, a lot of sellers are forced to do.I will spare you the meaningless and utterly confusing \"protection\" offered to buyers. They basically ask the seller to ship the item without receiving the money he earned for 21 days.\nNever again. Oh, their English is sometimes sloppy too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T11:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:30:00.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

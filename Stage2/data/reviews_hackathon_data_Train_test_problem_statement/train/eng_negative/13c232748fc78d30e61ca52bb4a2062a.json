I contacted SelectQuote: and was assisted by Adam Wainbright. I did not realize that I had made a final commitment to insure my home with Safeco Insurance.

I needed a courteous person to help advise me and instead I had to deal with a pushy sales person. Mr Wainbright needs to learn manners and respect for your customers. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T03:09:15.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

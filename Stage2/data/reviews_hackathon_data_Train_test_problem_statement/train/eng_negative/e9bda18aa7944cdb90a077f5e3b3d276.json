I received a call Feb 12 saying the airline cancelled the last leg of the journey. Talked to Flight Hub and they said they would rebook that leg but it would take 10days to do this with their flight partners. I said that was not acceptable as I had to know I had a flight booked. After 40 minutes on the phone they came back and said they were able to do this. They sent me the revised ticket. Today 3 weeks later they call me and say it is an issue and not booked. What??? They basically said either we change our dates or they will refund in 8 weeks. I called the Airline directly and had it straight in 20 minutes. The customer service is horrible. The person that left a message last night was barely understandable and did not leave a number.

I contacted Digiprint via webchat a month later (24th February) to find out where the order was as I'd had no further contact other than order confirmation at the time of placing. I was only then informed that the parts were not in stock and they would not be in receipt of them until 1st March. By then we needed the parts urgently so I requested to cancel the order immediately as I would source the parts elsewhere. I expressed my disappointment that they had not informed me that they did not have the stock and had not notified me (poor customer service from the outset), I was told via webchat that I could not cancel the order that way, but had to send an email directly to digiprint to cancel the order. So I wrote up an explanatory email stating the situation and requested to cancel the order. The email did not go through that day or the next, so I then resent it through the \"contact us\" box where eventually I received a reply:\n\" Hi\nThanks for the email.\nYou did not receive an automatized massage?\nWe have launched a new site and had a few problems, I’m sorry for the in convince caused.\nWe expect the part on the 1st of March. Are you certain?\"\nI replied that I had already explained myself and yes I was absolutely certain I wanted to cancel the order.\nReply\n\"HI\nThanks for the email.\nI’m sorry for the difficultly you have had with our chat service.\nThe email I sent yesterday was a follow up to the automated email you should have gotten.\nWe apologize for any inconvenience vince this may have caused you.\nKind Regards\"\nMy further reply was a request that could you please confirm that the order had been cancelled.\nI received no reply.\nYesterday the goods turned up and I've checked my paypal account and the money has been taken!\nI've already replaced the goods, do not want this package and request a refund immediately. I called yesterday hoping for a resolution, followed up with an email and still have not heard back.\nThis needs to be resolved ASAP.\nPlease arrange for the goods to be collected and a refund arranged. I can't believe the amount of time I've lost dealing with this order. I've held back on the one star as no-one has been rude, but frankly the service I've received so far has been appalling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T11:51:47.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

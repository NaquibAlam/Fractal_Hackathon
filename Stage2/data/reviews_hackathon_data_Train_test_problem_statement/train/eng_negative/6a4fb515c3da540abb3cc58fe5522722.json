When I arrived at Budget they stated that the insurance was not sufficient and if I wanted to use the Rental Cars.com reservation I had to post a 50% deposit for the full value of the car - over $10,000. I was at the desk with my family for over one hour trying to convince them that I had a valid prepaid reservation. Instead, to get a car I created an entirely new reservation through Budget for nearly $700 with \"full insurance coverage\". No credit was given to me for the money I paid to Rental Cars.com Rentalcars.com referred me to American Express to make a claim. I'm out $456.58. Don't use these guys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:01:15.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

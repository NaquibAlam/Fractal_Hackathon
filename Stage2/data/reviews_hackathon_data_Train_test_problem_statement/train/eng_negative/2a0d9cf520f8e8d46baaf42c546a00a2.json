You expect a hard sell for additional insurance, but even after stating that I already had cover, the aggression continued. I'd booked a VW Polo or similar, but was fobbed off with a Dacia Sandero, an unwieldy, unsophisticated vehicle, OK on the motorway, but not great for parking on an island where parking is often oversubscribed. I noted numerous deep and rusting scratches on the bonnet and roof and got this signed off. When returning the vehicle, the woman checking me in wasn't interested in signing the sheet and as soon as she'd registered the mileage ran off with the keys and disappeared from view. A few days later they deducted 250 euros from my credit card and sent me an email saying thank you for trusting Goldcar, the attachment may be of interest to you. This stated : checkin bonnet : 250 euros. They used a noreply email address for this communication. I raised an issue using the online form and 2 weeks later received an acknowledgement the damage hadn't occurred during my rental period. However, they refused to reimburse my credit card and I had to send my bank account details to obtain the refund. I have still ended up out of pocket due to exchange rates/commission. I will avoid them in future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:58:46.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

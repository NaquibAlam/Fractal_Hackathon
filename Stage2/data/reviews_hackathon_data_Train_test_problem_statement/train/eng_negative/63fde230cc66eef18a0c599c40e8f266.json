It was supposed to be a guaranteed delivery on February 14th. I received an email on Valentine's Day stating that they wouldn't be delivered. I called them and while they refunded my money and delivered the cupcakes the next day, Valentine's Day cupcakes the day after Valentine's Day don't exactly have the same effect. Additionally, I believed I was getting Crumbs cupcakes and I'm very familiar with Crumbs cupcakes. I don't believe the cupcakes I got were from Crumbs. When I had previously ordered Crumbs cupcakes through Bake Me a Wish, they arrived with a Crumbs sticker on the container. These did not. So so so very disappointed in Bake Me a Wish. I will never order from them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:50:16.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

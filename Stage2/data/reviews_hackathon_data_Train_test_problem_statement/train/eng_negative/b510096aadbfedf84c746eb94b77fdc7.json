All was well on the phone call. Was Quote: d $58, I wanted it delivered that day since she would probably be gone from the hospital by the next day. Which they agreed to do after he had checked with delivery man and florist. 7 hours later I look at my email to see a charge of 67$ for 3 roses and a tiny bear. That's insane !! Also almost $10 more than what I was told would be charged to my card!! I also look to see that none of my information is correct other than my first name email and phone number. My address was shown as Arizona when I live in WA and last name wasn't even close !! I also tried to track my flowers to see if they even were delivered and there was no confirmation and the deliver date said the next day!! What A HUGE MISTAKE AND WASTE OF MONEY ! Calling company tomorrow to see if they will at least compensate me for the original Quote: !!\nUpdate!! The flowers were never deliver . I had contacted my friend and asked how she liked the flowers and bear to get a very dumbfounded what flowers and bear?? Then. After calling and being on hold and arguing with the lady on the phone for about 20 minutes that I did not want her to deliver my already over charged pathetic $80 flowers to someone who was not in the hospital anymore I was put on hold for another 10 minutes and luckily was finally refunded my money after about 3 days. Don't do it !!!! Read the reviews! Look at all the deleted reviews !!

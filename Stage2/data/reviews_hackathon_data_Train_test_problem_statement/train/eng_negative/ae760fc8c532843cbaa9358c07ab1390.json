Leicester.\nOrder No. 200175092\n1ordered 2 x XQD memory cards for two events for last weekend (25 & 26 February). I ordered them on 15 February and at the time of writing (27th Feb) I still have not yet received them. I heard nothing for the first 5 days, then I was sent an email on 20 Feb to say they've been sent via recorded delivery.\nSEVEN days later, I still haven't received them.\nI do not believe for a second that something posted via recorded delivery, takes 7 days to arrive. They have given me a tracking number....it doesn't work.\nI'm very unhappy with a 12 day wait for two memory cards at over Â£128.00. Also, there's been no communication and it took a complaint to receive an answer.\nI'll be contacting my credit card co. for a refund.\nMobyMemory complained to Trustpilot about my review. They said they don't recognise me as a customer! This is despite me putting my FULL name in the review and my order number. I am a real customer and I have sent Trustpilot proof of this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T13:04:00.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

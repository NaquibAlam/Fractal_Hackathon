We waited two weeks for my sons bed to be put together and the table we needed to exchange somehow was never scheduled even though we spoke with someone about scheduling an appointment. Then someone called me on a Wednesday to confirm Thursday night delivery and Thursday evening I received a phone call that it would be delivered Friday morning when no one was home. Then the night we finally were going to get the new table the replacement was also broken. The driver then rescheduled our appointment without telling us and it ended up being during the day when we were both at work. Very bad experience will not be going back as we spent a lot of money there and were caused unnecessary headaches!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:37:15.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

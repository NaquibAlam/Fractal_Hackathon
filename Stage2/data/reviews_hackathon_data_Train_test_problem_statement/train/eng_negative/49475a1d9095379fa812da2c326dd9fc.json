The model is not found or sold on the Ray-ban official website. At a glance they look like RB 2132, but there were some differences compared to current original Ray-Ban New Wayfarer. The glasses came in a white neutral box, without the Ray-Ban packaging and without bar code.\nSmartbuyglasses manager replied to my complaint by email, Quote: : \"Not all brands come with authenticity cards/.../They do not always include all labels and tags within their packaging.\" This is not communicated via the smartbuyglasses website when making a purchase. Furthermore, I received no explanation as to why the glasses I ordered are not available/found in any Ray-Ban official website. Smartbuyglasses claim the glasses were authentic. I have very strong doubts about that.\nI sent the glasses back for a full refund. I had to pay for tracked shipping. I will not shop here again, and I do not recommend shopping from this website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T08:18:07.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Received Usual email confirming order and payment. Got a phone call 2days later to say the watch i ordered and had paid for wasnt in stock or available online. I was offered another watch. I didnt want another watch so i was offered a payment refund, which i received within 2 days. This shopping experience was Hassle, grief and a waste of my time.

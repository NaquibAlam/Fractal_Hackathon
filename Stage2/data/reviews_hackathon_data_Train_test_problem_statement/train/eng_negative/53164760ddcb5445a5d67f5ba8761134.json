Because she didn't take the trip down there with them, they called her a no show and cancelled her whole ticket. We were told if we wanted to change the ticket to a home trip for around 5000 DKK (The ticket was 3700 DKK) so thats a total price of 8700DKK (Over 1000USD) for a home ticket. Never have i had this bad of a service! Unless we get compensated, we will NEVER travel with them again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:11:25.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was never contacted so the first time I learn about the rate change is in my electric bill. Cost me $40 more just that month. So I jumped online to renew. I didn't feel like shopping, only to find out it would take another 2 weeks? Huh?? I'm already a customer, you can't just change my rates, effective immediately? If I called, it would probably be different, but I chose my avenue of communication and stuck with it.\nAlso a warning about \"billing cycles\". When I first switched over, they did it 5 days before my regular billing cycle ended. Not sure why since one of the questions they ask is \"When does your billing cycle end?\". So those 5 days ended up being billing cycle #1 while the other 11 were full months. They obviously honored their contract but in a BS-y sorta way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T15:17:09.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

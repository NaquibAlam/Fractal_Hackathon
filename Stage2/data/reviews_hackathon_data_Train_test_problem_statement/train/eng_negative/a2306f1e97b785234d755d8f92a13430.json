However, my boyfriend loves them and convinced me to try out their products. So for Christmas, he bought me an iPhone 6 and I bought him an iPhone 6S, the new Apple TV, an Apple controller and the new iWatch, totalling to approximately £1750. I am one of these people that hate paying for overpriced merchandise, but I thought, for the price, at least they should be decent and last a long time. And I would've assumed, after spending that amount of money, that Apple would give a s@*t if there were any problems. How wrong of me. At Christmas, my boyfriend opened his watch and was over the moon, but it would barely fit on his wrist. We joked about how they must of made them for super skinny wrists! However, a month later, we found out that Apple make watches for women and men (although they deny this). So I emailed them and said that I wasn't very happy because I had obviously bought the women's watch, despite saying to the sales guy that I was buying it for my boyfriend. I told them that my boyfriend was thinking about selling the watch and buying the other one, which is really heart-breaking for me, because it was so much money. £400 is a lot of money, obviously not to them, but to me, it's a ridiculous amount. And there's only about £20 difference in the two watches, so obviously I would've liked to have gotten him the bigger one for the extra £20, but I wasn't given this option from their ill-informed staff. So, I got an email from them about a week later saying that they don't do men and women's watches, just different sizes of the screen and if I wasn't happy, my boyfriend should sell the watch and put it towards a new one. I was absolutely gobsmacked. Firstly, do you not think I should have been told that there were different sizes? I know nothing about Apple, and they should assume that for all their customers. I went into their store to ask for their help, specifically. Otherwise, I would've just ordered online (which I wish I would have because I probably would've been given more information). Secondly, they obviously didn't listen to a word I said, because I told them I did not want him to sell the watch. It actually makes me feel gutted and to tell a customer to sell their brand new item, instead of making THEIR mistake right, is disgraceful. Actually disgraceful. Who in the hell do they think they are?! I would've actually been more agreeable if they had said that there was nothing they could do. But to tell me to sell it. I still can't get over it now. What shoddy customer service. Obviously once they sell you their overpriced products, they don't want to know any more. I don't think I've ever felt let down more by a company and it just solidifies my views on these sorts of companies. Never again will I shop at Apple. Shocking customer service, if you can call it that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:10:52.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

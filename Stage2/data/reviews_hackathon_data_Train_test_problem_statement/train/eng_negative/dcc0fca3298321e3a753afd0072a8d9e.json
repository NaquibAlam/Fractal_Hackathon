I got 8 bottles of reds for $50, and then waited for an email regarding a next shipment so that I could decide if I wanted to accept or reject the shipment. No email ever came. Instead, on a day that I was expecting another package delivery, the Vinesse delivery came. Without inspecting the shipping label, I signed for the package. BIG mistake. It turned out to be an unasked for delivery of 6 bottles from Vinesse.\nAfter several phone calls to 'Customer Service' it turns out the only way for me to know a shipment was about to be sent, was if I went to 'my account' every day, to watch for the notification. I have never belonged to a wine club where they did not clearly let you know beforehand that a shipment was pending, and where you could either accept or reject it.\nWe finally settled on a lower price, and now I have 6 bottles of wine that I had never asked for, and probably could have gotten equal or better quality, for half the price.\nStay away from this company!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T07:31:42.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

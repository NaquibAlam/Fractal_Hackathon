I received my confirmation number. When I got to Tokyo on the 26th I went to check in for my flight and I was informed that that I did not have a ticket and they did not have my name or anything for my round trip flights. So had to purchase new tickets at a considerable rate increase. When I got back home from my vacation I called this company to tell them what happened. I told them that I did not receive any email other than my confirmation. They refused to refund my money because the airline doesn't give refunds. I said the airline did not take my money you did and that the airline had no record of me. This is the worse company I have ever dealt with. I just wanted my money back for services not rendered. This is a rip off. DO NOY USE THIS COMPANY. I will keep posting until I get my refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T06:09:14.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

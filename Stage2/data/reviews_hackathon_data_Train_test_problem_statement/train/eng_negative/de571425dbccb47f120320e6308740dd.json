(Even though I felt funny about it).\nThere were 4 downloads to take care of my 16 new or too old drivers - garbage, garbage. Low and behold after wasting my time - I learn that they want different amounts of money for the 'service'. I immediately backed out - found that they had installed the files. I was able to uninstall 2 of them but the last two titled with Tweakbit have not been uninstalled. From the beginning of the uninstall process, repeatedly \"Please wait until the current program is finished uninstalling or being changed\" appeared - it has now been over 24 hours and it is still appearing and the files are still in the same location.\nI did not feel my computer needed to be 'faster' - it was fine. Now I am running into problems with downloading files and working with Acrobat DC, after never having any difficulties before.\nThis was a misrepresentation as if it was supported by Microsoft, no costs were mentioned until the end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:24:40.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

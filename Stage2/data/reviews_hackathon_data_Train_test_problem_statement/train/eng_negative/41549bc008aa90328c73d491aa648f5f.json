The cleaning crew did a good job of cleaning the surface areas and preparing the bedrooms and bathrooms.\nThe house is only a 3 bedroom house, although it is advertised as a 4 bedroom. Someone is counting bunk beds in a 9’ X 10' foot room with no closet as a bedroom.\nInconvenient access to the house. Steep hill.\nI realize this is a rental house and can understand the marks on the walls and stains on the furniture, but this house has the appearance of being abandoned by the owner.\nNumerous mattresses are being stored in the single car garage which makes it difficult to open car doors once you get your car into the garage.\nThe dune walkover has some completely rotten through boards at the ocean end of the walkover. You have to step over the hole.\nThere are cracks in the walls and spots on the ceiling which appear to be due to prior, or existing, water leaks.\nSeveral of the doors to the outside do not close tightly. ( they have large gaps between the door and the frame). Maybe this explains why we had to purchase pesticides to kill roaches, spiders, ants and salamanders during our stay.\nThe plaster is falling off the ceiling in the small first floor bathroom.\nWhat we thought was the neighbor’s security alarm turned out to be the pool pump making a very loud noise.\nThe exterior of the house needs some cleaning/painting. The doors are dirty, the paint is coming off the deck and dune walkover, the landscaping is washing down the hill.\nSteve Milo, the President of Vacation Rental Pro, told me via email on Dec 8, 2016, that someone would contact me. On January 12, 2017, I sent Mr. Milo an email advising him that no one ever contacted me. On February 1, 2017, I sent Mr. Milo another email advising him that the property was still being advertised as a 4 bedroom, that my review was not included on the website, and no one had called.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:56:14.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

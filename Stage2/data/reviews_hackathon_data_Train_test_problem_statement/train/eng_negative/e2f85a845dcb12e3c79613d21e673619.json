Starting about January, 2017 the technical problems have been very frustrating. It started with my tree would no longer sync with Family Tree Maker 2014. After downloading and uploading new trees to get the sync working again, I lost all of my attached media and photos. In February, again my trees would not sync, repeat loss of documentation and photos. For about a month when I try to add something to my tree, I keep getting a message \"Some features are not available at this time, please try again later, we are working on the problem. A lot of time is wasted repeating this process 4 to 5 times to add something to my tree. I understand an occasional technical problem, but if your computer techs can not resolve it within a month, you should look into replacing them with those who can. Before your customers replace \"Ancestry\" with \"MyHeritage\". My understanding and patients has worn thin. I assume you will resolve these technical problems before my membership renewal is due on April 13th, if not, I am switching.\nThank you bftaulbee1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T13:58:35.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

You can actually get this insurance from specialist companies for about £40/year - YES YEAR!!\nThis was not clear until the rental voucher came through and when I tried to cancel they refused to refund the insurance premium quoting 'terms and conditions' Well of course they wont refund as, I expect, too many people, on reading the small print, would try to cancel.\nOther rental companies manage to make it very clear. One. for example clearly says\n\"Full Protection ...for complete peace of mind\nAt the counter, the car hire company will block a deposit amount on your credit card. You could lose your whole deposit if the car is damaged or stolen, but as long as you have our Full Protection, we will refund you! Why pay more for cover at the car hire counter?\"\nCarFlexi equivalent is\n\"Yes, I want to add the Theft & Damage Excess Protection for only 11.5 GBP a day.\nExcess or Deductible is a renter's financial liability that can be charged in the unlucky event of car theft or damage to the rented vehicle. For peace of mind we'll refund any charges.\"\nAnd if you go to the detail they talk about deposits of 1000 Euro per day.\nWhen I spoke to the company providing the car (Budget) they said they never charge the full amount - the normal deposit is 100 - 200 Euro.\nEventually after an exchange with their call centre, they agreed to refund the previous booking fees if I booked with them (and omitted the excess insurance) At this stage I had discovered this insuring the excess with the local car rental company is 'always' an optional extra payable at the time of rental and if paid negates any need for a deposit.\nThe whole process (which should have taken 10 - 15 minutes took the best part of a couple of hours.\nNever again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T00:42:52.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

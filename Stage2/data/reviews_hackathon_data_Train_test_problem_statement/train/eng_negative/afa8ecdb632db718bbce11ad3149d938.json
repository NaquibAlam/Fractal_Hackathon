I ordered compression socks advertised as low compression and XL size. The socks that arrived were way too tight and certainly were not XL...back they went at a cost for me almost equal to what i was charged for the item...thus out of $10 right off the bat. Diabetic socks received were so flimsy that holes appeared after the first wearing. After these experience, needless to say, i threw all the catalogs form this company in the trash...where they will go from now on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T22:35:14.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

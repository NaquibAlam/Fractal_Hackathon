I ordered two items for my iPhone 6, one was fine, but I didn't really like it, the other one was perfect except it was a size for an iPhone 5... So before I sent both items back, I asked the MiniInTheBox if they would refund me for sending the items back. They answered that they would first need to review it, so I have to send the items back first. Which I did, costing me 10EUR. They never refunded me this money, and Mauricio from their customer service team replied that I should have provided them with a photo of the wrong item... Which is not what was mentioned the first time I asked... And a photo? Why? I have sent back the items, so you can find out yourselves that it was the wrong size, right...? Anyhow, after asking Mauricio these exact same questions, I got a very rude reply from him, not answering any of these questions, just stating a refund is not possible. Now a couple of angry messages later, he is lying to me that the right item was sent... Well I have tried a couple of times, but an iPhone 6 does not fit, and it even said iPhone 5 on the carton inside the item... All-in-all, very rude customer service. Don't be fooled by the cheap prices, it is not worth the hassle afterwards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T15:17:55.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

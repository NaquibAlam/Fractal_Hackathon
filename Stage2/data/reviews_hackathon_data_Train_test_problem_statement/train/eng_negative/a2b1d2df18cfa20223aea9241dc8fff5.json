The box was hugely oversized for the contents. It could have been consolidated to 17*14*3.\nBut then, an executive over the phone says they would keep the dimensions to a minimum of 18*15*5. They set the dimensions accordingly in our account and we paid $ 90 ( that actually matched shipping calculator estimate ).\nBut then the shipment was not shipped the next day ( 26th January ) - and Usgobuy account shows $34 other payment. The shipping calculator could not have been wrong.\nThe thing was that the dimensions were rather kept as 21*16*7. Still very huge parcel with 7 inches height.\nWe mention different dimensions and then Usgobuy executive after rejecting most, agrees on one last. But then again, the package is not consolidated to what was agreed.\nWe have been calling since 26th between 10AM to 5PM PST, our calls are not received.

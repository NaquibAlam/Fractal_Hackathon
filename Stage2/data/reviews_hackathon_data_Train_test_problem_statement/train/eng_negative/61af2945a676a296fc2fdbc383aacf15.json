I recently placed a new order using my old file they had in their system and ended up having the entire batch printed wrong. I spoke with one of their customer service employees on the phone and explained what had happened and was looking to work on a solution together. I wasn't looking for a new run for free, given that I had approved the proofs they sent me with the artwork. Instead of working on a solution, their customer service representative chose to insist that I hadn't used the file from their system and multiple times said that I had uploaded a new file and it wasn't their problem. He was implying that I was lying about it. I have no issues having to pay for a new order, but the refuse to continue working with a company with such bad customer service. They have just lost a loyal client for not knowing how to deal with a simple issue. Beware when ordering their products. Make sure you get everything right from the outset or you may be treated as a lier by their customer service representative.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:36:27.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I received an order confirmation, but no shipping confirmation.This wasn't the first time this has happened, but I always received my orders from Ryonet within a few days, so I thought nothing of it. This time though, Ryonet only shipped half of the order out. Half of my order arrived the day before the deadline. Not thinking anything about it, I figured both inks were inside the box. I set everything up, get ready to print, open the box, only to find out I don't have one of the inks for the job.\nI contacted Ryonet to try & find out where the rest of my order was & was treated like an oversight & like \"stuff like this happens\" when I spoke with the Ryonet rep. I'm told that the ink I selected, ordered, charged & paid for was discontinued. The ink was still on the site, my card was charged & I received an order confirmation. At no point did Ryonet ever take the time to alert me that this product was discontinued.\nOnly after stating this did I barely get a \"sorry about that\" from the rep. I was then told that they can overnight the ink to me, but since it was already past the shipping time that I wouldn't receive it until 2 days later.\nAt this point all I wanted from them was a refund & it took convincing to even get that. I kept telling him I wanted a refund & he kept trying to pass me off to a manager in hopes to change my mine. Finally when I convinced him to issue my refund, it then took over 30 mins to process. How in 2016 does it take over 30 mins to process one refund?\nI left a Facobook review & contacted Ryan Moor (who only tried to sell me on another type of ink. Really dude?) about this experience & then was told by Ryonet that they tried to contact me multiple times. THIS IS FALSE. I contacted Ryonet multiple times, not the other way around. I was told most times that someone would get back to me & that never happened. I was never able to get a straight answer from Ryonet management. One person would tell me that the ink is still in stock. Another would tell me that there was no more in stock. Either way, if it was still in stock then why did it never ship & if it wasn't in stock then why was I charged for something that was never there & never alerted about?\nI was never able to find the same color ink in time to get this job done. I tried my best, but the best I could do was get something overnight & my customer could not wait another day. I ended up losing the screen printing job because of this & wasting my time in the process. I can take losing a job, but I ended up losing a customer who I come to find out had told multiple other potential customers about the experience.\nI will say that Ryonet did try & make things right financially. I will give them that & I appreciate that. But unfortunately it won't help me recover from losing this job & the entire experience of what happened. I also had to wait for that compensation too, since I was told multiple times that it went out in the mail & saw that the postmark proved otherwise.\nIn the end, Ryonet lost a customer", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T23:15:12.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

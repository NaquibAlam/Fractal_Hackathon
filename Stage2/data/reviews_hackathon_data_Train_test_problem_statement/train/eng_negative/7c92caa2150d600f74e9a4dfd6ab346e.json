I have had the luxury of using several services and job boards for this over an extended search.\nBut it wasn't until Zip that I started getting blatant fraudulent job emails asking for bank info. Upon further research it turns out that the companies \"viewing\" my resume don't exist. But now someone has my contact info. What a perfect way to generate contact lists! Preying upon the jobless who have to put themselves out there to get hired.\nAs it turns out - I am one of a very large group of dissatisfied users.

I signed up for a short time just to get some wines sent around the holiday season and then a few more maybe to pick up United miles. Tried to delay before my card was charged when I saw the next shipment was going to be a $125+. Decided it wasn't worth that price, so called to cancel at various times for a week straight and never got through. I emailed to try to cancel after that, was told I could only do that on the phone. Then they charged my card and sent the wine anyway. Now they tell me I can send it back but I have to pay the $100 shipping fee. Don't waste your time, go to the store.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T07:33:11.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

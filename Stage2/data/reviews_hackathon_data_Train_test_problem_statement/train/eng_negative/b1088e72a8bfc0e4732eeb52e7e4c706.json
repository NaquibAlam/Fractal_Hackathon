Was it worth it?\nMine and I see many more people's transaction was cancelled because the documents couldn't be verified. It's because their website sucks. Your customer support team is replying to people's comments to \"discuss\" what went wrong, that's even better. All I want after cancelled transaction and a upsetting review is \"discussion\".\nI would like to know on a public forum what would you do for your poor service and cancelled transactions? Do you give a better rate, faster transfer, turn back time and make the money transferred when it was supposed to, or just send an apology and \"discuss\" how stupid the user of your website are, to even use your services and they should go for ICICI, Xoom or some other remitting service?\nEDIT :\n\"after review we asked you to upload the remaining documents in question\" :\n- The email specifies \"some\" documents are missing,\n- when logging into website a pop asks for SSN and then disappears.\n- The subject line of the email says AML documents\nDo you see the problem here ? No communication from your end specified \"WHAT\" document you need from me, not even the \"Verify Documents\" link on your website.\nYou need to understand how crappy your website is, which is the sole service you are trying to provide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T19:49:18.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

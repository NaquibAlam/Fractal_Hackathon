Amazon they arent. I ordered a whole piece of equipment from anothet vendor the same day that wieghed 500 lb. It arrived before this 5 oz piece of plastic was even pulled. Last time I order from them.\nUpdate. The excuses they listed below are invalid. My complaint is not with the delivery but in the processing time. Item ordered just after lunch on wed 8th. On mon the 13th I got an email saying the item has shipped. They attached a tracking number from a second party vendor that says dilevery was on the 13th which it wasnt. How can an item be shipped and delivered same day. It would seem they dont communicate with their second padty vendors.\nThe part is not needed for another 5 days. My complaint is not in the delivery its in their paperwork. Plus the tracking number says, delivered yesterday. We get UPS everyday and the package was not in it. The complaint is between them and their vendor and email to me the customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:43:50.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I booked a compact automatic car for a month but was disappointed to receive a semi automatic cumbersome Fiat 500 ( dreadful car to drive) they said no other car was available at the time so I had to take it. After the drive to our destination I found the car to be difficult and in my eyes dangerous to drive as in a parked position it would roll forward downhill in REVERSE gear before enough acceleration was applied to move in the right direction i.e. Backwards and then it would lurch backwards in an uncontrollable manner. On ringing Centauro Malaga to complain I was told that Yes it was a difficult car to drive but in order to exchange it I had to return it to the office myself. Because of the difficulty and perceived danger I didn't want to drive the car again. Eventually they agreed to bring a different car out to me but NEVER mentioned a Fee. It wasn't until I returned home that I found 124 euros had been taken from my credit card without my permission. The company can only say I should have read the small print. I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN and warn others to be careful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T22:21:39.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

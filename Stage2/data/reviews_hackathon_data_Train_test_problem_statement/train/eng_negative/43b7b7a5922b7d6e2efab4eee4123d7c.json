It was after 9.30 , giving me a delivery slot if 11.47 - 12.47 . I rang my husband at home and he was waiting for the delivery . This is a large Victorian house, he was upstairs at the time when there was a ring on the bell. By the time he got to the front door , there was a non delivery slip pushed through the letter box. The driver could not have waited . I have re- scheduled the delivery for tomorrow and will place a note on the door asking the driver to ring and knock and wait !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:15:43.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

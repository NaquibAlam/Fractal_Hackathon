I received what u called pre-approval. I was assured or certainly led to believe I would be receiving the loan of 5,000. Waited all day today Thursday , much running around and hassle to provide them with the details yesterday. I was led to believe I would be officially approved today. I was called by whothe girl working on my application twice, the first time I was told they only needed one more bit of info and the lender would happily grant the loan. I had already provided that info the day before so it was a little annoying. Then they told me I was only approved for 2,000, my old vans worth more than that. I'm devastated after all the stress and will make sure I warn everyone else online about NATLOANS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T22:24:18.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It wasn't a vacation trip at all. I needed to change their returning date since the process and all the paperworks were done quicker than we thought. So they would like to come back early. I called flighthub and talk to the agent to change my reservation on March 27 at 10:30 am. I spent about 2 hours to arrange these changes. The agent told me that I would get the confirmation email about the changes within 24 hrs. I even called them back around 6 pm to ask them my confirmation email and the agent said it will take about 24 hrs. Then, I received a forward email from my husband that he got email from flighthub.com regarding an immediate attention required. The email was sent at 11:47 am to him (Malaysia time, so it's 11:47 pm Toronto time). I opened the email at 5:15 am, I called flighthub rightaway. I spent more than 2 hours to settle the issue. Apparently the ticketing department didn't put my request when I called them yesterday and now they have to reprice the airline ticket and I ended up to pay more. The supervisor wasn't helpful either. She refused to talk to me until I insisted to talk to her. How is it my fault that they didn't process my request and now they reprice the airline tickets?!!! This is absolutely a very unprofessional work that they have done!!!! They did wrong at their end, but we have to pay for their mistake. I am not going to buy ticket from this website anymore nor I will recommend this agent to my friends and families. They are doing bad job and have no sense of sympathy at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:22:31.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

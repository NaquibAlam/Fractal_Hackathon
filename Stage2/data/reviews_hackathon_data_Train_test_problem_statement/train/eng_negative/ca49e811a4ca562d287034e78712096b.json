I was under the impression the person I was talking to knew what they were talking about. Fast forward to my appointment on 'move in day' as Sparefoot calls it...\nFor one, she didn't know we were coming. Didnt even have the space available I had an appointment to see. When I asked the site owner about the discrepancy she said she's been asking Sparefoot to remove the incorrect info off their site. We took her last space while there. She didn't even have any covered spaces available. The gate is not 24 hours as I was shown online and on the phone.\nWhile this is a great idea, and seems to get great reviews elsewhere it lacks here in El Paso, Tx.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:16:05.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

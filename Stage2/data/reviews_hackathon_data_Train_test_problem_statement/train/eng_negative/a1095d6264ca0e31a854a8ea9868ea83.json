The last 2 times I have placed a reorder, they have sent me an email AFTER they have charged my account, telling me the order would be delayed 7-10 working days due to my contacts being out of stock. Normally this would not be an issue but the last time I placed an order, I was down to my last pair of lenses and needed to receive the reorder as soon as possible. I called Customer Service for an update and asked why customers weren't told about lenses being out of stock BEFORE the order was submitted and their account charged. The guy I spoke to just kept repeating the same thing over and over again and offered no answers or resolution. Possibly the issue is that he didn't speak English very well and was reading from a script. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor who might be able to offer some assistance. The woman I spoke to pretty much just repeated what he had told me but she did offer to upgrade my shipment (when/if the lenses were in stock) to 2-day shipping. I will be shopping elsewhere for my contacts in the future!\nETA: Funny how after all the years of ordering, the suddenly do not stock my particular brand of contacts. All the more reason to shop elsewhere in the future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:55:43.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

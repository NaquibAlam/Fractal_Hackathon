China Eastern cancelled booking, had to go through LM to get rebooked.\nAfter 5 days of hassle, booked by the company on a flight that loses us a day so have tried to change. LM deliberately delays, distracts and promises to help you until you give up and accept a poor cheaper alternative because you are stressed and have no time or will to continue the battle, and are fed up with borderline lies from powerless call handlers.\nHave called at least 8 times - each time the request for a different flight is being 'escalated'. This is obviously not happening and this department does not appear to exist and seems to be a deliberate ploy to keep you hanging on in hope and having to accept an unacceptable alternative when you finally run out of time and patience.\nThe 'booking team' is never available and does not appear to actually exist either. You are promised that you will receive an email or call within the hour or that evening with alternatives but nothing ever happens and you are consistently told to wait 7 days after each part of the process. If you ask to hold to speak to the booking team, the call does not get answered.\nThey want you off the phone as quick as possible. They do not call back or email when they say they will. You have to call and start again from scratch with a different agent who will read back you previous calls and promise he is escalating it. It is a painful, pointless loop.\nPlease avoid booking flights with Lastminute. The saving you are offered at the the beginning will be offset by your time, stress and disappointment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T21:20:25.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

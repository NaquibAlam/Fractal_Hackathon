Ordered frames on Jan 2nd, billing and shipping didn't match up ok so I fixed it by Jan 4th. Order started processing and billed on Jan 6th. By Jan 10th still processing so I decide to change the size of the frames. Jan 11th Order Cancelled due to \"no stock\" in that size, ok no problem. Website stated refund issued immediately and should be posted to my account within 3 business days ok great. Jan 13th still no refund, contacted customer service via email because I like everything in writing. Was told by rep to wait 1 to 5 business days, fine. Well it's Jan 23rd now and still no refund. Sent them another e-mail Jan 21st and no response. Sent them another e-mail directly from website today and will wait for response. By end of this week if I have not received my refund I will be contacting my credit card company to report them for fraud. This has been a terrible experience with Go-Optic if you want to risk it then it's up to you but by the looks of it, a lot of people are unhappy with their service.They are not accredited with BBB yet have a 1 star rating with BBB hhhmmm interesting. Their \"low\" prices are not worth this headache go elsewhere pay a little extra and actually get what you pay for with good service.\nUPDATE: Refund received. Paid in US so when I received the refund it wasn't actually the full amount since the US $ rate had changed. Anyway this was a terrible experience and I'm just glad it's over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:53:37.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

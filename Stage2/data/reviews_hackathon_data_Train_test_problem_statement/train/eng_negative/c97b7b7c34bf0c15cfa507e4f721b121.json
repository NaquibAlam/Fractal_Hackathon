On 13th January my order status changed to delivered when in fact it has not been delivered.\nI sent them many e-mails and all they said was the item was delivered when in fact it hadn't been delivered. I got fed up and phoned them. They told me they need to chase it up with Hermes and will get back to me within 24-48 hours. Nobody got back to me so I contacted them again. A week later I called them again and they told me the item had been delivered at the wrong address. The gentleman I spoke to said he would get back to me within 24 to 48 hours to inform me whether they would issue me a refund or send me a replacement item. Three weeks later after that phone call and 5 e-mails later nobody got back to me.\nSo I phoned them today and the lady we spoke to said she will get her manager to call us back within 30-45 minutes to have a refund issues. No phone call back so after 1.5 hours we called them back. This time the gentleman that answered, Connor said that Karl, the manager is not at his desk and he does not know where he is and also told me they can't issue me a refund because the items had been delivered. How is that if a few weeks ago they told me they delivered it to the wrong address? It seems that now it is nowhere on their record that the items had been delivered at the wrong address.\nKarl Westerside if you're reading this, we are still waiting for your call back. I will continue to write to you and to the Gameseek CEO until I receive my refund.\nThis is frustrating as I have ordered from Gameseek many times in the past with no issues. But this time around, the company wants to be washing their hands off any responsibility!

Unfortunately, I did not ask them to unpack it at the dock so I could check it out. I got it home and parts were broken. This is the third lamp I ordered that I've had to make multiple trips back and forth to get the right item and an undamaged one. I will no longer take anything packed. I will make them unpack it so I can check it out before I take it home. I am a bit disappointed in this lack of quality control.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:38:34.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

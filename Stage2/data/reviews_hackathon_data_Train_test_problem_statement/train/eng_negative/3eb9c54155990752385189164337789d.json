The sign up and checkout had no issues and as it said it can take up to 24 hours to receive, I was not concerned when I didn't hear anything immediately.\nIt wasn't until the next day that I received an email from them requesting that I send them photos of my ID through their ticket system on the website as they needed to confirm the transaction and it would be illegal to progress without it. I spent over half hour trying to submit photos using their system and was repeatedly getting errors as it would not accept them due to file size.\nI sent another reply through the ticket system advising them of this and asked if they could get back to me ASAP as I was getting the PSN code to use in a sale that ended in a few days.\nI didn't get a reply until the next day, which was a short message advising me to upload photos of my ID and credit card to a website and to send them the link! In addition to this, I checked my card statement and they had already taken the payment! I was not happy with this, but was able to use a secure site I had access to for uploading photos and sending a link, advising them of the above on the ticket system again.\nNext day there was no reply. I checked the site to find that they were closed at the weekend and the sale I needed the card for was ending Monday. I went onto Play Asia and picked up the same card for cheaper as they had a 5% off and received it immediately. I then updated my ticket on Nippon Yassan to say that I could not wait any longer and had brought one from another source, hence I would like my order cancelled and my payment refunded as I had not received the goods.\nMonday morning, I had an email saying they were processing my order and a few minutes after that my code arrived. I was absolutely furious as they had obviously seen the messages on the ticket system or they wouldn't have been able to look at my ID and since the latest message was at the top, it would have been impossible to miss - meaning it was ignored! The code was sent too late anyway for me to use in the sale i wanted and as it was a 10,000 yen card, being charged again when i explicitly asked them to cancel is a horrific service!\nI will not be using them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:14:13.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

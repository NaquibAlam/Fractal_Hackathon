Three days before the match I finally receive a ticket but its located smack in the middle of the Lecister home support in the Spion Kop! I emailed them to enquire what went wrong. Of course, no response. I then contacted the number provided to validate the ticket. I was then told they were not able to get the ticket I paid a huge premium for and no apologies offered. I asked about a discount or a refund and he murmered 50GBP. I gave him my paypal account and chased and of course nothing has ever been paid back!! Emails go unanswered, no tel numbers to dial, and then I get a Survey sent to me!! And despite filing a complaint through the survey, I still don't get a response. These guys are seriously a bunch of dodgy crooks. Typically, I wouldn't bother with a site like this that doesn't have a customer service telephone number but I was anxious for a ticket. In the end, I went with them because their U.S. parent company Stub Hub has been very legit during my past experiences. Unfortunately, these guys (Ticketbis) do not mirror the same class and service. And yes, I made the mistake of ignoring all the bad reviews from prior ticked off customers. I will take this next to Stub Hub. I validated the ticket in the early going but did not end up attending the game. I like to provide vocal support for United and obviously would not be able to sitting in the Leceister Kop end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T23:11:38.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

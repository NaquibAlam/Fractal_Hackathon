Everybody is pretty fine in normal conditions - to please the market. But only when things go wrong, you can see if the company cares about its customers or just about their money. KLM failed this test miserably, when last week my return flight was cancelled due to a strike in Berlin airport.\nFirst it went not that bad - they found an alternative flight for me, with Austrian Airlines, it was a flight 1 day later than planned. So far so good! It's just that I couldn't afford waiting for the next day, I had to come back on the right date. So I decided to book a train ticket (from Berlin to Amsterdam), which resulted in the travel time of 6.5 hours instead of 1.5, but it was my only option. And it was more expensive than the flight - by approx. 70 euro (2 adults), because I booked the last minute ticket.\nFirst I discovered that KLM's website is terrible when it comes to compensations. You cannot even contact them by email, you simply don't find how. They offer Facebook, Twitter, but not email (WHY?!). The call was busy (waiting time of 10 min it said). The customer service via Facebook (I used my wife's account) doesn't do anything for you, they just send you some weird URLs to online contact forms that you can fill and then wait for a couple of days for response. I had to fill two different forms - for cancellation of the flight that they offered and then for compensation of the train ticket... Intuitive and simple? No, that's only when you buy something from them!\nBut my biggest surprise was to figure out that they don't want to compensate the extra cost of the train ticket (approx. 70 euro). They now claim that it is not their fault, because there was a strike, and it is written in the conditions and blah-blah-blah... So it is written in the conditions - awesome. Does it make it fair? I am also not guilty for that strike, do I But somehow I am the only one who pays the price, both in money and in extra inconvenience. Me - the end customer, while the company of KLM size loses nothing! All the damage is offloaded on the end customer! Not to mention that they will also claim compensation from the striking airport, which I cannot do, of course.\nAnd that's not everything! The most irritating part is that my claim is much CHEAPER than what they offered me when they rebooked my flight! If I would accept that offer, I would claim extra hotel night + meals for two adults for the entire day! Here I just claim this petty extra cost for train tickets! So I am actually SAVING their money, and they still do not want to be on my side?!\nThis is the most eloquent combination of a stubborn \"by the book\" handling and ridiculous inappropriate greediness of this company. And for this I paid extra, when I chose them instead of a low-coster?! Wow, never again...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:11:05.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

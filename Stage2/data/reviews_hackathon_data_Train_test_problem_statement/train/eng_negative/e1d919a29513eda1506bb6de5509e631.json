I wouldn't waste your money here. I placed my first order with them and they sent me the wrong item. When I called to have the correct item sent, they refused to correct their error. They made it sound like it had to be an exchange that I wanted and asked me to go out of my way to find a printer, print the return label, find a post office and pay for an exchange. The problem here is that I never received the item I paid for. After talking to a customer support supervisor, he kept saying it was policy. Though there's no standard policy for this since this is clearly an error made by their warehouse. It's not an item I wanted to return or exchange. Don't waste your time or money with Fabletics. I cancelled my subscription immediately.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T05:53:22.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

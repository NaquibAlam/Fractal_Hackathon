Shipped via: Landmark. After two weeks I try to track my order, but receive message: \"Selection of service chosen is International Mail. As a result, further tracking information is no longer available\". In december I asked on my local post office, there is no any information about my order. The same answer was in january. On february the 6th, I send email to Fanatics support team. Answer was: Claims regarding lost packages must be reported within 45 days of the ship date. Because it is beyond the 45 day time frame, we are unable to process a replacement or refund. I've paid: Sub Total: $113.79 Shipping: $24.95 Total Paid: $138.74 - they coudn't help me to find order or refund my money. I think that they didn't send me any parcel, only take my money.\nI do not recommend anyone to order from this store. You will be deceived, but Fanatics.com will say they not guilty and ask you to leave a nice review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:48:25.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

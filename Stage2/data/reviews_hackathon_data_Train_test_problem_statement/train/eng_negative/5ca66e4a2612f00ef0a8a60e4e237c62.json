I received my etickets from FlightNetwork but when I tried to check the booking confirmation into LAN Airlines website, the booking looks incomplete! It only shows from Madrid to Santiago de Chile, only the return way!!! I contacted them by chat but they aren´t helper at all! They asked me to call by phone to try to fix that. The booking looks good into FlightNetwork.com, but not into LAN Airlines! I hope that they can solve that, or what can I do? They don´t return money! Be careful if you deal with this company! This was my first and last time dealing with them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T19:56:10.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

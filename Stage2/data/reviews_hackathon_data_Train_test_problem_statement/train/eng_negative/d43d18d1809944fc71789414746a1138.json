SURPRISE - Kayak diverts the booking to a scam site Webjet.com. This company lied, saying my credit card charge had been declined, delaying the actual booking of the ticket by more than two days. Then, GUESS WHAT? THE PRICE HAD DOUBLED! They're looking for suckers desperate enough to pay double.\nKAYAK needs to stand behind their offers or close their doors. I checked the Kayak offering continually for several hours after I submitted my order, confirming that the low price was still there for plenty of time for the booking to have been made. This scam appears to be just one of many on the Kayak web site based on other reviews I see.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T14:17:24.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

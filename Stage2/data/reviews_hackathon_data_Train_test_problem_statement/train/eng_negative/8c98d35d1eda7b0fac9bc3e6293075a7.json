They were delivered on the 15th in such deplorable (completely dead) condition that I still find it hard to believe that any company would operate in such a manner. I wish I could post the pics here as visual proof for anyone contemplating ordering from this outfit. They offered to resend a new arrangement at no additional cost to me (there's a novel idea) and when I refused because it was now 3 days after her birthday, they stated in an email that because they had attempted to correct the situation and I refused that they would only refund the cost of the arrangement and not the $13.95 handling fee. Horrible horrible horrible company!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:04:46.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This was on a Monday. I told them to come back on Wednesday due to my work schedule and they showed up Tuesday. Luckily I was home! They were suppose to have the furniture already inspected and the furniture was still damaged. The only thing That was not damaged was the top of the table. I have to wait for them to come back for a third time to drop off furniture. My fingers are crossed that they will actually inspect it so that I do not have to send back once again. I paid for brand new so I want it to look brand new!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:57:20.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

But once the order went through, I received an email indicating that the lenses weren't in stock and that they would take 10 business days to arrive. It's now been almost four weeks since my order was placed, and I still don't have any contact lenses. I called opticontacts today, and they indicated that it will be another 10 days until they ship my lenses! The fact is that they could get the lenses from the manufacturer overnight if they were willing to pay a bit more to fix their mistake. Instead, they offered to give me free overnight shipping. But that is no consolation given that the lenses are going to be at least five weeks late. The website should be more honest about what is and isn't in stock. I would have just ordered from someone else if I had known the wait was going to be this long. This is truly a terrible company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T19:43:44.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

According to the description, the camera was on stock and usually would will be shipped in24hours. On 2016-11-28 the camera still hadn't been shipped and I canceled the order. I than ordered from Amazon and received the camera in 3 days and at the same price.\nMy second order was placed on 2016-11-27 for a Wifi IP camera. On 2017-01-12 (7 weeks later) I had still not received the camera and the tracking link only showed \"Shipment information received\". I wrote to customer service twice but never got any reply so I finally had to open a Paypal item not received claim.\nAll the time they kept sending me daily advertising e-mails from which I tried to unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link and although I got a message that I was unsubscribed, I still received the mails. Writing to customer support asking to stop sending them did not help either so I had to block tomtop all together.\nMy advise.... spend your money elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T16:22:16.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

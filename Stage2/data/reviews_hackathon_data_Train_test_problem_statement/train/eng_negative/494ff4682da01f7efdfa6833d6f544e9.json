My actual locker was clean. I haven't seen any mouse droppings. The staff was very nice, but almost seemed like they were reading off of a script.\nBut... It's very dingy in the building. The carpets do not look very clean, which is somewhat understanding with the amount of people in and out of the building all day.\nI get nervous riding the elevator to the third floor. There is a sticker/sign on the elevator stating on 12/20/2016 the elevator was deemed safe to use, but did not pass inspection. the notice also states another inspection is due in one month.. On 2/25/2017 the same notice was still posted. When the button to call the elevator is pushed (on the third floor) I noticed the lights dim like it's using to much power... The elevator doors open very slowly which is also a bit concerning, especially when knowing the elevator did not pass inspection.\nI will continue to rent at StorageMart, but more because of the convenience than anything else. It's on my way to the place I will be staying it and is only a few minutes away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T10:54:00.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Alas, we couldn't have been more wrong! The VietJet flight was to be taken in March, from Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok. This was confirmed by lastminute.com on 8 January. But just a week later, we received another email from lastminute.com telling us that the airline had made a change to our booking and we were now booked onto a completely different flight which left Ho Chi Minh City over 4 hours later than the one originally bought! As we have onward travel connections in Bangkok, this flight is completely useless to us. After countless telephone calls and emails, finally lastminute.com agreed that our booking needed to be cancelled and a refund made to us. That was on 26 January. We have made further phone calls and emails - yet here we are, a month later and still the refund has not been received. Then, to add insult to injury, at 5am this morning, the entire household was awoken by a phone call from either lastminute.com or VietJet (not sure which, my husband was half asleep!) trying to persuade us to take the flight which is no good to us. I just don't understand the problem here. We paid lastminute.com for a flight that has since been pulled by the airline. Our contract with lastminute.com was broken. SO WHERE IS OUR REFUND? By the way, we have already booked another suitable flight with another airline; we can no longer wait for lastminute.com to sort the issue out. And needless to say, we will never, ever use lastminute.com again - and from reading all the other complaints here on Trustpilot, will certainly advise others to avoid lastminute.com like the plague.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:12:53.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

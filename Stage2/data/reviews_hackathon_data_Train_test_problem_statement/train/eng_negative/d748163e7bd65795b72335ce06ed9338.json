The website took me through the steps to give feedback etc., however, I did not receive an email confirming this. I did not know that was necessary to \"prove I had cancelled my subscription.\"\nLong story short, all emails received hence I believed were junk mail and did not read them or look at them, but apparently it was their way of confirming I was receiving another box and would be charged for it. I was charged $60 without my consent, and now have a box of food that will spoil as I have no fridge space. I am both sincerely upset about the wasted food and the money that I no longer have to go towards paying my rent.\nI tried once more to cancel on the website, and I never did receive a cancellation email for that. So, I called in to customer service believing that they would be helpful as the food industry, which I spent over five years in, is customer oriented. I was told they could do nothing for me. I had the other person whose name is on the credit card charged call in to see what she could find out. She talked to three different people and apparently experienced incredibly rude behavior. This is unfortunate.\nConfused and disheartened, I looked them up on the Better Business Bureau's website, they have an F rating and are unaccredited, as well as have 23 unresolved claims. I am disappointed in myself for not doing the research necessary before consuming a product. Therefore, I thought I would post to warn others. Do not sign up for this because there is a large chance you will be sorely disappointed by the policies this company holds, and the people who enforce them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:21:16.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I placed the order at noon for delivery the same day and was told it would be delivered by 4 pm. Two hours later they called to say the delivery would not happen until the next day. When I said I wanted to cancel the order they told me I had to speak with a manager to do that and put me on hold. The call was never picked up. I hung up and tried again - I had to explain again the reason for my call and was put on hold again for a manager and the call, again, was never picked up. I called a third time and finally, spoke with someone who cancelled the order. By this time, it was too late for me to get someone else to deliver that day. I will never call them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:09:51.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They have made it impossible for me to get my no claims bonus cert for my new pollicy, fobbing me off with imessages when Ive requested a call back, ignoring my requests and redirecting me to the customer portal, even though I have insisted 3/4 times that I cannot find my cert there. This began on Monday, my policy lapses at midnight and I've just found out that I'll now have to pay for the cert because they were so slow in responding to my messages, literally one message per day, even when I reponded imediately. Extremely frustrating and to be honest the whoke thing has left with a particular disdain for the company and their so called system", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:09:01.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

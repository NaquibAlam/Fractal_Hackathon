A couple days following my email I got a short reply saying the phone had shipped a day earlier and was now in the process of delivery (expected within 3-5 days). I then asked them for an invoice and tracking information. Another day passed and I was informed that they will provide the invoice once they have the tracking number.\nAt this point I opened a dispute with PayPal. Lo and behold I got an invoice from Antelife the same day.\n4 days later they sent me an email with a tracking number and a tracking website - and said that it usually takes 10 DAYS for the tracking info to update, but my phone will be with me within 7-30 days - so still no usable proof or tracking info. And they had the cheek to ask me to close the dispute with PayPal to which I said no.\nAnother 4-5 days passed and I was about to cancel the whole thing with PayPal when I received a message from PayPal that Antelife refunded the money and the case was closed, I received no apologies nor any explanation from Antelife. In the end I only lost probably 3-4 weeks and a couple euros in conversion fee. I'm not sure if they were trying to scam me, but when I ordered the phone their website said they had more than 10 in stock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:24:02.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

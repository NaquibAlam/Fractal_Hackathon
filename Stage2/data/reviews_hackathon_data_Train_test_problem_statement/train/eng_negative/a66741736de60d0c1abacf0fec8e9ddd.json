I recently ordered something and the quality was poor and did not fit as stated. I received and RMA # as instructed and return the order and it has been delivered for more than their allotted 10-15 days and no one will now respond to any emails that I send. They will not answer the phone. You stay on hold for over 30 minutes then a recording comes on and say due to high call volume you will be disconnected!!! Sucks!!! Will never order again if I get the store credit they promised since they do no do refunds", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T19:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T15:59:08.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The company guarantees a one-day delivery, which can on occasion take 2 - no problem. The flowers (all 5 of them), arrived 4 days late (total of 6 days) and were in terrible condition (stuffed into a small box.)\nI rang the company on several occasions, each time I was promised that the flowers would be arriving that day - which never happened.\nThe final day I rang the company again as I had received an email confirming the flowers arrival (was not the case.) When I told the woman on the phone I wanted to speak to a manager she told me there were none in on that day. Then when I threatened to take legal action she told me her manager was in a meeting and would be available in a few minutes. For the entirety of the 3 occasions I rang the business I was told every time that I would and could not be refunded. I was even given the email for the owner of the company who, to this day, has not replied to me.\nThis is the worst company I have EVER had to deal with it. An absolute disgrace. Money-robbing-b@@tards.\nOn top of all that, I just found out yesterday my phone company was charging me £12 for the call. DO NOT make the same mistake I made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:54:18.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

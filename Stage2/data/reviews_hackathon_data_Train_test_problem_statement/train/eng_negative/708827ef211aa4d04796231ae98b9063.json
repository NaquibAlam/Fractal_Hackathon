Arrangement SUCKED. My husband is so upset because this was a birthday surprise for me at my office. Customer service is a literal JOKE. 40 minutes of trying to get though to people for whom English is not their first language. They wanted to CHARGE Michael an extra $40 to replace the arrangement I originally received (which I thought he had maybe paid around $25 for since I knew he had already gotten me another gift but he knows I love flowers). On top of that.... they signed the card \"MICK\" ... good thing we are happily married... can you imagine getting a delivery of flowers from some other man!!!! He was assured on the phone by the sales person, \"A large, beautiful bouquet of roses, etc.\"...HAH!! I got daisies in a Dollar Store tea cup with three tiny tea roses and one carnation. I felt so bad when I got home. His face just fell when he saw what he had paid $67.00...I think what made me the most upset, aside from him feeling so dissappointed in what was supposed to be a lovely gift, was the fact that there was a $13.95 delivery charge.... and the florist that did the arrangement is literally 10 feet from the front door of my office. I could have met them in the parking lot in the back office as I park my car facing their back driveway where their delivery vehicle is parked every morning.... not the florists fault, they are told what to arrange.... so, now they are supposed to come pick up the \"old\" arrangement and replace with a \"proper\" bouquet.... well I'm on a three day weekend for my birthday. This is why I ALWAYS use local florists directly... these services are a rip off. I worked for a greenhouse many years ago in accounting.... I know how much all this stuff costs.... and this company is a sordid, tawdry, money-grubber taking advantage of people trying to do something nice for people they love! I'm simply appalled!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T05:00:42.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

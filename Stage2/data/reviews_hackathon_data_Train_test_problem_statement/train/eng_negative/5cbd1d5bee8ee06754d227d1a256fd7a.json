Today I didn't an email giving me the details of the time of delivery, and with the location of my parcel being at the Hub I decided to call up to find out about the delivery. Would have had to pay charges to call the Ireland office if not for the helpful customer service I received from the UK office (I'm in Northern Ireland), which informed me that I wouldn't receive my item today or tomorrow, but rather next Monday most likely. Poor service by DPD Ireland, but given these other ratings I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T08:00:10.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

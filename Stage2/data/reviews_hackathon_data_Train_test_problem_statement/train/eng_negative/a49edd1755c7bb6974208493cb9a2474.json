They claim they have not received them. Than after further delay, because they don't rush themselves, they claim they did not send a returns note, strange that because it was mounted on the parcel., so not only out of pocket for over £75.00 for shoes, also out of pocket for the cost of returning them to Poland. They then wanted proof of posting, this was scanned and sent as requested., still waiting for the refund and in fact a reply. Very Very poor customer service., poor contact., no real effort to solve the problem., get the impression if they take their time replying and sorting the problem you'll go away. AVOID THIS COMPANY - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\nRead the reviews, this does not appear to be unusual.

Town Fair Tire in Searbook NH is bad at scheduling customer appointments. They consistently run 1.5 hours or more behind, at least in the afternoon. But not only this, they are not truthful with their customers. They claim to get started right away and the claim that work takes 1.5 hours for 2 tires while it does not. They are trying to get you to believe that wait time equals work time. As a minimum I would expect them to be honest. An apology would also go a long way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:25:04.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

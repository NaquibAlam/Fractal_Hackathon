Despite purchasing fully comprehensive insurance online the member of staff on the desk at Malaga airport insisted on charging me £120.79 when I arrived to collect the car. He stated that if I did not pay the fee I would be required to leave a \"credit card deposit\" of 2000Euros as a surety.\nI was assured the £120.79 was a refundable surcharge when returning the car. When I returned the car the member of staff mysteriously developed a difficulty communicating in English and rather than miss my flight I left the desk without a refund being actioned on my credit card.(silly mistake)\nI wouldn't trust these gangsters again Easycar are as bad for recommending these shady gangsters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T15:46:57.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

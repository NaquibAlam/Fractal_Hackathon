Really bad service!\n3) Why do I have to pay 20 Euro for the Second driver Certification??none of the other Companies is charging for this!\n4) If I want to insure my Second Car with 25Plus company it cost me 2770 Euro (yes this is the price of my last Quote: ), crazy!! I have 5 years no claim bonus!!..and if I try to understand or ask for a discount on that price the Customer Service answers is: \"I'm sorry, if you got it on line unfortunately we cannot change anything\"\n5) Why do I have to pay 48Euro if I want to transfer my policy to a newer car!!?? For the Car I've already registered I should pay even less!\nI have many other points to write down but I'll summarise everything in one world: unacceptable!\nI've been for 5 years 25plus Customer but lately I've been treated really bad! That will be the reason to change soon to a better Company.\nThank you", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T09:46:33.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

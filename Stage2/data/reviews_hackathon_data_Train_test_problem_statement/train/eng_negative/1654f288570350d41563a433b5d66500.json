Since I could not assure Sixt about this additional requirement I could not get the rental car. This left me unable to fulfill what I thought was a done deal.\nSince I did not get the rental car as promised, I hereby ask that my deposit be refunded to me immediately.\nThanks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:37:07.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

However, I've been logging on for a couple months and rarely find my size (L) in stock for the items I'd like to order - disappointing. Today there was a President's sale going on and a few items I liked were in stock in my size (4 of the 15 I looked at), but the checkout experience was VERY frustrating.\nFirst, each item in my cart had a discount (yay) but when I clicked to complete my order, it said some items were no longer available - rather than the site removing them automatically, it sent me back to do it myself (boooo). From then on, the discounts were no longer applying for the remaining items until I removed them all and started from scratch, re-adding each item one by one. Finally when I was going to give up, the page refreshed and said \"Signatures Items 50% off, limit 4 per person\" so I clicked on the Signature Styles page but only some would reflect the discount in my cart - UGH! I finally ended up calling customer service and they were to manually apply the discount for me in order to convince me not to give up on the entire purchase.\nI live in a small town where there is limited shopping so I primarily shop online. While I'm still willing to give this site 1 more shot next month, I'm disappointed to admit that this was one of the most frustrating shopping experiences I've had.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T13:32:38.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

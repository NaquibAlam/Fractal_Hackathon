There was a design or manufacturing defect, and they refused to cover broken frame under their warranty. They returned the frames at my expense as 'repaired , and repaired the wrong side. I then sent back at my expense , and they claimed to have sent them to the manufacturer. They were cagey when talking on phone, but they had no documentation from manufacturer that they had been ever evaluated, saying \"it was done on the phone'. I contacted the manufacturer, and they told me that they had no record of GoOptic ever contacting them, gave me a different place to get the warranty work done.\nI reported them to BBB. They are working the case but they say Go Optic has an F rating, which is the worst they can give. I also reported them to California Attorney General, and they are working on that as well.\nIn short, AVOID Go-Optic. You will get slow, poor service; the warranty was worthless, and life is too short to do business with people like this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:54:34.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

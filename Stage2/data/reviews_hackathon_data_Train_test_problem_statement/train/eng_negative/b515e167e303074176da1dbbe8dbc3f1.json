I opened them and after checking to see that everything was in the box, I tried to mount the quick disconnect hardware. After having some trouble with the bolt threads I called and was informed that they sent me the wrong bolts. They said they would ship new ones. I told them I was planning on riding and I need these bags on Sunday. They offered to give me a $25 refund so I could go purchase my own bolts. I got the hardware on and marked the bag for the holes and drilled them. Per their instructions I put the one bag on top of the other to align them so I could mark for the other holes only to find out these bags are not exactly the same and I could either lineup the bottom of the bags or the top bags! Basically the right bag is about 1/8+ in. taller Than the left bag. Some may think this is not a big deal but I just paid $500 For saddlebags and followed the instructions to the letter and my bags will not ride even on my bike because they are not the same size. You'd think that would be something they checked before shipping these out. Id have posted the PICs of the difference but there is nowhere to upload pics on here.\nUPDATE--The right side bag is all around defective!! The top doesn't close correctly and therefore it doesn't lock securely. After sending the videos to Viking they said they would send me out a NEW bag. Its been almost 2 weeks and still NO BAG You'd think since they SCREWED UP my whole order they would send the bag overnight or at least expedite the shipment.

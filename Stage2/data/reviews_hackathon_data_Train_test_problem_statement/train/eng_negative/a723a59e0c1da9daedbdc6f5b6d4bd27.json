Received a notice 2 days later that they were not, and delays were typically 5-7 days. I contacted Opticontacts 7 days (2/20) later to inquire the status and they did reply: \"Sometimes we're forced to wait for a certain prescription. we're just as unhappy about these delays as you are. We could say the manufacturer doesn't like certain brands being discounted on the internet so they limit the distribution and it takes longer, and there's nothing we can do.\"\nWhat you really CAN do is have your site state that product is not in stock when the customer places the order.\nAgain I did receive communication that my order was shipped on 2/23. With a 5-7 day time frame. You COULD have overnighted at that point.\nOpticontacts does offer a discounted price, however they tack on a \"processing\" fee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:56:58.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I called the number and the employee told me that he would be right there. He asked us the unit size after showing them and we agreed to the 10x10 climate controlled for $95 per month and a $19.95 first month. After finishing all the paper work he told me that I had to purchase his insurance of which I told him I did not want to pay insurance. He said that it was required. I told him where was that on the Ad then he changed it to \"If I didn't want to pay the insurance then I would have to provide a copy of mine\". I provided a copy then he told me it would be $95.00 for the first month. I told him that it said $19.95 and he told me only if I purchased his insurance. I told him that it did not say that on the Ad and if it had I would not have come here. I would have gone to a closer place. He told I could go somewhere else which I told him I felt like he was trying to force me to by something I didn't want to buy. I asked him to show me where it says that on the add. He would not try to find out for me but after a lengthly back and forth conversation he then offered to pro rate the charge. Of which I had suggested in the beginning, when he told me my next payment was on the 1st. I had told him it did not seem right since I was moving in on the 12th of which he replied that's just the way it was. I agreed to the pro rate because I had already spent 3 hours on the process and could not afford to start over somewhere else. It felt like an ugly experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T07:50:25.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I had very simple questions about the mason track arm reversible sectional sofa in blue grey and had to call sales twice and they both couldnt answer my questions the first person I spoke to was a man who didnt want to be on the phone he told me he has no clue what fabric the couch has and that he would not do a price match because NFM doesnt do that. Even though the price match was on a instock item. I then responded do you have any couches similar to this one and he said I probably do but there is 100 couches so cant help you there. I was so upset I hung up. Then called again hoping to get a new sales rep and end up with this girl named katie or katlyn and she was complete snob. She literally told me do you want to buy the couch elsewhere because I have no idea what the fabric is .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T18:30:19.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

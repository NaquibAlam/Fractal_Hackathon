I wore them 3-4 times over the next 6 months as I rarely need them. A nose piece arm fell off although they were never damaged, mishandled or put under any pressure. I returned them 12/6/16 for warranty repair warranty. I received a call 12/9 saying the frame is no longer available in brown so they were replacing with gray and they would no longer be covered under warranty. I found this odd and rude as there was 6 months remaining on the warranty. They were received in poor condition on 1/9/17: earpieces wider at tip than hinge, one earpiece 3/16\" lower than the other and the case was broken. They had been well packed for return. I sent them back again that same day for repair. They were received 1/20 adjusted but with a case that was not same as original and too large for the glasses.\nThis was a poor experience from the start. Times for processing and the first repair were too long and the second return should not have been necessary. The call to say the remaining warranty would not be honored was absurd as the glasses were not damaged but failed and they did not allege otherwise. I do not recommend Frames Direct for their poor customer service and will not buy again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T02:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:23:37.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I received a confirmation number and was led to believe that within 60 days my energy rate would be locked in with this company. Not only did they not switch over my account, they failed to inform me that they did not switch my account. I called because my supplier was still my old supplier only now I am paying an exceptionally higher rate. I called Think energy and was told that my delivery company rejected switching my account. This was not true as I spoke with my delivery company and they said the only thing submitted was a request for my usage records. I confronted Think Energy about this and was finally told that they have a 2 month back log of requests and they would get to my account when they get to it. This is no way to run a business. When it comes to your electric service reliability and integrity is most important. Think Twice Energy is a more suitable name.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T10:43:23.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

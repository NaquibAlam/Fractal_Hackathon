The correct metal chains that were delivered had a plastic connector which failed on the first attempt at use. They then sent continuous loop metal chains which were half the required length. Eventually I received the correct chains.\nThree out of four blinds were ok, the fourth was frayed at the edges and a replacement had to be sent.\nDelivery was appalling. 5 attempts made to deliver by UPS. The delivery slot given by UPS is (before the end of the day).\nThe only positive I can give is, the customer service manager gave me a 15% discount and returned the cost of the metal chains.\nI would not recommend Blinds2Go to my worst enemy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:40:55.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

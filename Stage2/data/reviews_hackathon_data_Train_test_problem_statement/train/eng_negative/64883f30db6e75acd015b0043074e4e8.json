DON'T FALL FOR IT!! I unfortunately did and regret it. My battery drained on a car I bought less than a year prior after a few weeks with the device. The person who came to help me from AAA even stated the device was the reason to kill my battery.\nThen a few weeks later I went to go to work and the device was fine. I was driving to work and rolling test came. The device read that I was now, after 4 minutes of driving, at a .043 and went into a lockout. I did not have a drink alcohol/coffee/mouth wash/etc., or had anything at all in those 4 minutes. When I called customer service the rep. stated literally a laundry list of reasons the devices could misread, and I had to pay for a device to be shipped, be late to work, and just deal with the hassle overall. The rep. even after no reasoning to why it occurred had no care at all of any of these issues happening. The rep. made it seem as if at 8:15 on a Tuesday I downed a drink within 4 minutes of driving. Just little respect and empathy.\nThe worst part of having the device was going to remove it. The rep. took 18 minutes to answer. This was after giving my three digit #s from the device for a two month check-in to the one rep. (Separate issue that the #s never worked on their site). So I am transferred to a rep. to handle de-installation. They didn't ask best locations, times, dates, etc. like installation. The rep. just stated here is where to go that day. I had to explain that I could not go that same day because HELLO I am at work. So I waited got a time for the next day. Well given one option for a time the next day. I asked for email for this places name and time for appointment and the rep. stated they do not do that. I asked to repeat the name of the place and the rep. was very rude in quickly repeating. As if myself double checking was a terrible thing to do. I went and got it removed and paid about $55.00 to remove. Then best part, I had to find a UPS to send the device back to them. Had to make sure to do this promptly so to make sure that they get it the next day and not fall to close to next lease charge (that is 3 days later from removal). If it was not received tomorrow I ran the risk they would charge me for next month even those clearly I was not using it. No prorating either. Called the next day to close the account and the rep. stated adminstrative fees for this was $77.00. When I asked why this was not on the site FAQs for closing or every discussed, the rep. stated well it is in your contract and you need to read. I paid this but learn my lesson. They are crooks and just rude. No customer service at all!\nSHOP AROUND AND GET ANOTHER COMPANY!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:24:55.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

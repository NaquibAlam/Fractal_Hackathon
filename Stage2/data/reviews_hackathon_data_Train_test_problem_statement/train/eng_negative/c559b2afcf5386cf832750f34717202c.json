We got downgraded car, booked Mitsubishi Outlander got Mitsu ASX. They had 4 Outlanders inside but told me all were due maintenance. The real reason probably was they wanted us to return their QLS plated ASX to Brisbane where we were driving. We were still charged extra oneway fee of 300 AUD for returning their car and no compensation for downgrade.\nI was confident Rentalcars.com would surely compensate something but they just told us that Ace Car is saying ASX is same class car as Outlander! OK so it must be if they say so even though Outlander is bigger and 4WD which the ASX is not. Rentalcars.com compensated nothing and took no responsibility even though my contract was actually with them. So why not book directly from car rental companies as these guys will not help you with anything of you have problems.

The classic and touch I labeled as heavy wear and tear as they had a few scratches. The PS3 and PSP both had no scratches and worked perfectly so I labeled them as fair condition. I was Quote: d £97 and was very happy. It has taken over a week and they have listed the PS3 as heavy wear and will only give me £19. I gritted my teeth and accepted as I can't really be bothered to argue about it.\nThen I get an email telling me the PSP isn't in the box so they won't be paying me for it. I emailed back stating that it's definitly in there and lo and behold they've found it but it's in \"poor\" condition with heavy wear. It was practically new when I put it in there so either someone in the warehouse has been dropping things and lowering valuations or they just really don't want to part with the cash.\nDefinitely won't be dealing with these guys in future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T20:26:30.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I asked for the reason but was refused an answer other then they suspected my ad was fraudulent based on the photo I used and my account automatically frozen. After a week of daily emails between myself and the \"support\" team during which time they refused to give me either the contact details of their supervisor or a phone number so I could call Gumtree and complain directly they finally agreed to put the ad back on and sent an apology for the frustration caused. By then the prospective buyers were gone and the only other response for a whole week was from a scammer wanting to be contacted back. I tried to edit the ad and lower the price but at this time I was again blocked from posting an ad and when I tried emailing support my email was returned from host: data.ebay.com (216.113.172.68) reason: 554-data.ebay.com 554 BLACKLIST\nPity that eBay took over Gumtree because it used to be a decent site before that but ever since they took over it the site has been going downhill and the number of scammers and fake buyers has gone through the roof getting as bad as ebay. I guess the old idiom \"Birds of a feather\" is correct and they are all coming home to Gumtree and ebay to roost. They no longer have any phone numbers, have moved the \"support department\" to the corporate headquarters overseas yet are still claiming to be the local community noticeboard and that \"we're proud to say that Gumtree is now loved by its ever growing community all around the world.\" Yeah, right. The only ones loving it are the scammers because they are still allowed to operate freely using fake IPs while honest sellers are blacklisted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:23:26.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

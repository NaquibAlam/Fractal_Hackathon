It is now March 12 and still haven't received anything. Tried reaching someone for answers but got nowhere. Until tonight the support team said that their may be some holidays and bad weather that delayed the process. Um you charged by card the same day i made the purchases. And i don't believe it would take 90+ days to get my items. The excuses don't make any sense. Will never order there again. I hope other customers will steer clear of this horrible company.\nThe support team just finally got back to me and told me that they are not responsible fort he shipping aspects of the company if it was never shipped. They are no responsible for lost packages made by the parcel companies. And since i didn't purchase their insurance their is not much they can do. No refund or reshipping of the items.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T12:44:22.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

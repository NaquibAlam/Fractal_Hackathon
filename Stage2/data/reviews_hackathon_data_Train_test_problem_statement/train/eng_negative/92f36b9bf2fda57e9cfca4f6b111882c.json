In the transaction screen there was no restriction mentioned and only when the transaction went through I received an email saying this was a child ticket as well as it is a season pass and I will need to return the pass once the match is over. Re-selling of a season pass is of course not allowed.\nOnly explanation I get from the customer service team is they are only a platform to trade tickets. Shouldn't they have made all information available if that is the case? This is such a scam. If I do not receive a full refund I will take this matter further.\nRegarding your response below the only response I received is that you are unable to assist further or cancel the order since you are only a platform. Shouldn't all restrictions be disclosed on the ad before the ticket proceeds to final sale if that is the case?\nAlso could I ask what the reason is for having an expected posting date for the ticket only two days before the actual match when the purchase date was more than 1.5 months before the match?\nGiven misleading and lack of information provided (i.e. child/student restrictions, the fact that it is a season ticket that needs to be returned to the seller after the event - which is against the season ticket rule. Both were not displayed in the transaction screen before purchase was made) regarding this transaction, I would like to cancel the purchase. Can you advise how this can be done?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T06:12:45.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

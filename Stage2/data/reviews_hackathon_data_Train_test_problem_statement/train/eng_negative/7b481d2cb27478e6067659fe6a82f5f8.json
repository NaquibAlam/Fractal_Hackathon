It will ruin all your holiday, I am 100% sure about it. We had very very very bad experience. I can not express/explain my frustration in words. Such a bad customer services. We have booked everything last week to go to Rome, Italy and we have received the confirmation saying that everything has been booked. But all of a sudden the day before travel, I have received the confirmation saying that the hotel was over booked, so we have to transfer you to another hotel. But we have booked 4 star accommodation and they have provided us with 3 star accommodation. We said we will not be happy to go with it as we need up gradation or similar to 4 star or compensation. I have been calling customer services since 1 p.m and the last call I made was at 10:50 p.m and it has been discussed with many people during that 10 hour period and no one could resolve the issue.We were not sure whether we need to make travel arrangements or wait till they get back to us. On the day we were supposed to travel, we haven't still heard anything from the customer services. We got up in the early morning to contact the customer services and we have been told that they will contact us in 15 mins. They keep on telling us the same thing but never contacted. They say someone will call you to give update. But not even a single person has contacted us to give any update, its me who has been chasing them. I felt like I have paid the money to buy this bad experience/stress, ill health and not to go on holiday. I have been chasing them every 15 mins as I am not sure if it will be resolved before going to airport, I was in dilemma, should I go to airport or stay at home. Myself and my husband have booked our holidays at work, changed currency at bank, booked airport parking, we were all ready to go on holiday, but the hotel accommodation issue has not been resolved yet. Such a rubbish customer services. the people were talking from abroad and they were very very rude when we express our frustration. They did not take any responsibility at all which ruined my holiday. My wife had high blood pressure issue as she was in lot of tension due to the accommodation issue and the customer services behaviour. She became sick even before we went on holiday and I have to take her to GP on the day of travelling just to make sure that she will not fall sick on holiday again. The amount of distress, frustration and the impact on our personal health caused by lastminute.com can not be expressed in words. Only the person who experienced this knows the pain. I am victim of this rubbish customer service. So I strongly advise you not to use lastminute.com to book your holiday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:55:30.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was very excited to get my bags after ordering as i have wanted to put bags on my bike for a while now but simply didn't pull the trigger on it. But upon receiving my bags and tail light kit i found that the tail light relocation kit i soon discovered that i needed to do multiple alterations on the bracket to make it work for my bike. Then i discovered that after relocating the lights the bags still would not fit on my bike between the shock and the lights. I called viking bags and spoke to someone who told me that everyone had gone home for the day and that they would call me back the next morning between 9am and 10am, the next day 10:30am passed and i still received no phone call. So i called back, i was asked for my order number so i gave that, then i was put on hold for THIRTY minutes! So i hung up and called back, immediately asking to speak to a manager. The first guy who answered the phone said that he was a manager. i explained the problem and he told me that he has never heard of this happening before. I told him that i wanted different bags with a cut out for the shock, and i wanted them over night shipped to me for the inconvenience, he said that he could do that and that i would be getting them the next day. He also told me that i would get shipping confirmation at around 4 or 5pm that day. i never got shipping confirmation so i decided i'd call back while they were still open. At that time i was informed that my bags in fact were not shipped out and that they would be shipped out on Monday, friday being the day i called and they told me they would be over night delivered on saturday. So not only did the guy not do what he told me he was doing for me to rectify the situation, but i was not even informed that now i would not have my bags until tuesday. When i called back they offered me $40 off of the order because of the inconvenience, and i had no real choice in the matter because i needed bags on my bike so i accepted. When i finally got the bags on that following Tuesday i tried to install them on my bike and low and behold they did not fit either! They would have overlapped my tail lights by a good two inches! So being fed up with the company as it was i decided that i would just go replace my tail lights with LED low profile lights, only because i needed to replace them which i was not trying to do. To top it all off i put the new bags on my bike and THEY RATTLE as i'm driving down the road, the lids move on them pretty badly and it is causing material to be rubbed away on my brand new bags because of this fact. So now i have to modify this product even more and put some sort of black weather strip tape or something on the bags so the lids don't move as much and they don't rattle on the bike. i'm very unhappy with the end result on this order, i will never order from this company again. VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER RIGHT HERE. Which is unfortunate because the first bags i was shipped i really liked and felt they were great quality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T20:32:33.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

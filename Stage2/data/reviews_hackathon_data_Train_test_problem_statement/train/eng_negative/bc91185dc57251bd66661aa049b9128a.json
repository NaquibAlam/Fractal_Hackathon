I requested and told they would be delivered the same day 3/17/2017.\nWhen I originally ordered the flowers I was on the AVAS web site and selected a flower basket (Blooming Garden Basket) clearly priced at\n$47.99. but the price originally Quote: d by your agent was over $70.00.\nShe said there was a bow and large card added and a fee for arranging the flowers of over $13.00. I told her to cancel the order and I would order from a reputable flowers company. She twice reduced the price until I agreed to pay $57.14 for the flowers to be delivered.\nI received notice from AVAS late on Friday 3/17/2017 that the flowers had not delivered and later a notice that they would be redelivered, but never a confirmation of delivery. I called their customer service on 3/18/2017 and they told me they could not confirm delivery and the agent hung up on me. I called back and told Leo that the previous agent could not confirm delivery and hung up on me. Leo told me i should call the hospital and ask the person receiving the flowers if the flowers had been delivered. A very inconvenient and rude thing for me to have to do.\nAvas flowers are guilty of intentionally advertising the incorrect price and raising the price when ordered,and not following through for their customers to verifying the delivery was made and transferring that responsibility back to their customer. THE WORST FLORIST I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH. DON'T USE THEM.

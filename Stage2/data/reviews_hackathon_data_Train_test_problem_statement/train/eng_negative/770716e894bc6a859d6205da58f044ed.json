It was only after a few days into my holiday when I checked my credit card statement to find it was accruing interest and had to drive a 200 Kilometres round trip all the way back to the airport to have it refunded as you cannot get them on the telephone.\nOn picking up the car in their dimly lit car park on level 2 large scratches on the driver’s door were pointed out to me on the check list. I couldn’t see any more so accepted this and drove off. I returned the car after seven days in the same condition as I picked it up to the check in desk again in the dimly lit car park on level two and the agent checked the car and said all was OK.\nNow the nightmare, on returning to the UK I checked my credit card again only to find they had debited £282.28 for scratches to the bumper. I was livid and sent an email immediately to their customer services, they were not interested and said the charges would remain. I will not let this fraud go without a fight so have copied my 100 emails to their CEO Juan Cazcona waiting for an apology.\n“Steer Clear of GoldCar” They rip you off", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:46:58.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

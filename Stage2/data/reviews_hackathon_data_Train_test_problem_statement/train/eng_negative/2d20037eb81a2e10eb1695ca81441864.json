They didn't deliver my package, they never came to my door. I get a phone call from one of their drop off locations saying they have my parcel. The parcel is in the next town, 30 km away. Really, that can't be the closest drop point. But, this was an improvement on the last time when they were supposed to deliver a 2 carton delivery from the USA. They sent back box 1 of 2 saying my address didn't exist and called me to pick up box 2 of 2. If they are owned by Canada Post, why can't they figure out addresses. There is someone at my house 24/7, we have home business and a driveway alarm that goes off if anyone drives in. Why have I never had a parcel delivered to my house, even though the drivers all say they came to the door and nobody was home. Why do FedEx and DHL have no problems delivering to us", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:07:01.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

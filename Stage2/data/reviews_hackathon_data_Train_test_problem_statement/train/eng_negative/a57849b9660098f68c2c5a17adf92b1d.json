All Verizon phones with 4g lte do not require a code to unlock it. At first i didnt know this until I googled it after paying for a \"code\" that is not needed. Why would you guys charge money for a code that is not needed? Why wouldn't you just say on you website that most verizon phones don't need codes, instead of charging people for a code that is not relevant. That sounds like a scam to me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:58:50.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

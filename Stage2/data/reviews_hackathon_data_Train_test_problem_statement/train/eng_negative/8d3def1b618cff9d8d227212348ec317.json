Some items were available in stock immediately and no issues. However, upon ordering furniture not in stock was the worse decision we ever made.\nTop Saddle Recliner was promised 6 wks out from ordering. Called and told was there. Upon pick up and opening box.. Wrong Recliner. Next truck shipment date couldn't b promised and no date available. Offered Floor display and declined. 10 wks later my husband tk the floor display against my wishes. Extremely dissatisfied with their methods of shipping and receiving. No discount of floor display.\nPurchased beautiful table. Was given wrong one and had to exchange it in box.\nPurchased extra chairs for dining room set and upon putting them together legs were shorter on 1 of the chairs. Had to swap chair.\nI doubt we will ever shop at American Freight again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T14:54:00.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

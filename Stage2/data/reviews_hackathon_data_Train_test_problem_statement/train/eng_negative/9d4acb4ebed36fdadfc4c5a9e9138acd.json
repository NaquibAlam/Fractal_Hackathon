It is now nearly 10pm and I'm hungry. They say it left their contractor at 7pm, which means it has already been unrefrigerated for 21 hours. When this evening will it come? Who knows? I guess I will just stay up all night and wait for my doorbell to ring! For my trouble, they are giving me a whopping $10 credit. If it comes and isn't spoiled, I'll likely have to supplement anyway. Meat for 2 is pretty much equal to 1.5 children's portions. Not for an adult.\nTake your $10 per person to the grocery store. You'll know when it arrives, and you'll get a full portion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:31:51.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

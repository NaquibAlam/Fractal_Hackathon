During that time, we requested the tracking number through their website but there was no reply. We called and their response was \"we emailed you that it would be delayed\" in which we never received it. Once we received the package, one of the contact lenses boxes has already been opened and another one was half opened. This is not acceptable. i cannot and will not use the contact lenses that are not in their original and sealed container. The box is like the protection seal cap on the medication bottle. I will have to throw away those two contact lenses boxes. I have been buying contact lenses from many websites but none of them sent me contact lenses in opened container.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T19:43:17.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

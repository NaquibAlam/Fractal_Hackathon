It has sat on my desk for that time and hasn't moved. It stopped responding about a month ago. I took it into the Apple Store Covent Garden who were very nice, but told me that there is nothing they can do about it. They referred me to a Data Recovery company but say that there is nothing they can do to help. If you are considering one of these products, don't bother. Save your Â£250 and buy an online backup service. It will cost more in the long run, but at least you will have you're data at the end of 2.5 years which is far more valuable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T23:43:33.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

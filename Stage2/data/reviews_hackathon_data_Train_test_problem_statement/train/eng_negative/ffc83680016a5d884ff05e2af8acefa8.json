I placed an order at 8:36 am for same day delivery by 4pm no problem purchasing the order at all. I went ahead upgraded to the premium flower arrangement pre determined online what I wanted but upgraded since there is so much pride on client experience. Initial guy amazing but no follow through. I was told I would receive my confirmation number etc.. never got. I go through the website and find a trackin of my order at 2:30 when I never received a message from my girlfriend excited for her flowers. So I check I status update. I then call in at 2:35 garubtee they show up by 4:00 pm GARUBTEE. That's great my girlfriend get off a little after 4. Well at 4:22 I call back and they where not delivered yet. While on the phone I get the confirmation email the number and a delivery time of 4:18 after being on the phone for 12 minutes. So I talk to the lady on the phone about it and they offer $10 off my next purchase I told them I would never use them again. I asked for my invoice and what I was charged for delivery of same day before \"4 pm\" and she says okay I can give 10% off the next orders okay mind each arrangement is $100 simple Matt $10 either way so again I ask for invoice and total I paid for delivery. Won't give an answer had to pry it out m. I asked for a refund in my delivery fee then. Offer $9.95 when the arrangement delivery was close to $20 as far as I'm concerned from an $84 arrangement to $107.. so I ask for a manager non available and she is the best to speak with. Again I ask for a manager. I'm furious I'll hold until ones available to finally get $13.95 refund for all of this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T10:33:41.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

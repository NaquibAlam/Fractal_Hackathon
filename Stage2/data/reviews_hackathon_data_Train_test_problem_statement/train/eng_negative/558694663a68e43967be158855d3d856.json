I paid over $200 for Costa Del Mar sunglasses that I now have to wait at least a month to receive. In the confirmation email they promise an update within 3-5 days of purchase, well I had to call the company just to find out what was going on on day 6. I am also a student and never received a 10% discount. Not worth the hassle of trying to discuss this with them. Good luck, maybe yours are in stock! I thought this would be easy, and now I am going to a birthday party with an IOU. I won't be using them anymore and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. Large selection is deceiving. On the plus side, I can stop getting my hopes up each day when the mail is delivered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:27:09.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

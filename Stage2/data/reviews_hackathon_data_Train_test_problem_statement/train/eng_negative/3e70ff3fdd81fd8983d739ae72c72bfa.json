Then when you spend over $50 and expect to get free shipping, you don't if you've used another coupon code. If you research their site, it says you can only use one coupon code per order. A discount on clothes and shipping costs are 2 different things. Why would you even advertise free shipping on orders over $50 if you know people cannot redeem it? It's very misleading and caused them to lose a customer. Every site offers free shipping on orders over a certain amount. Seems pretty basic, and if they can't offer that, then don't advertise it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T21:34:29.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Then I got a 'thank you and a picture' of an arrangement I had sent to family.\nIt was 'sort of' close to what I ordered so I wrote it off as a slight mistake.\nI know it is probably difficult to get exactly what you see as an arrangement.\nMy last experience I spent just under $200 for a Christmas arrangement that was not remotely what I requested. Pictures were sent again. I was quite embarrassed by what was received. I notified the company twice of my displeasure asking for a refund or credit. I have never received a response of any kind. Do they think we will not see the arrangements? Stay away from this company.

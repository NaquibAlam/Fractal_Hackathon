I ordered 55 travel cups of which 78% were misaligned. I called on Friday and send pictures of some of the cups and was told I would be contacted within 24 hours. 24 hours lated and no phone call. I called again on Monday and was told that I would get a callback in a couple of hours, but still no callback. I called again this morning and was told that they apparently overlooked my pictures and that I would get a call back today, but I never did. I called back only to be informed that the claims department was close for the day. I needed these cups starting last Thursday when they arrived, and told them of my urgency to at least have them ready by this coming Thursday, but yet they haven't done anything to resolve my issue. I am really disappointed with this order and their service. I recommend you use other places to get your correct order in a timely fashion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T20:15:04.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was told it did. When I went to pick it up, they gave me a foundation that the guy who works on the dock was stapling. He was tring to get the bottom cover to adhere to the foundation frame by stapling it through the protective plastic. I was upset to see the poor quality and to realize that the product had been misrepresented. I talked to the manager and it only got worse. She said that a foundation and a boxspring are interchangeable terms. I informed her that they were two seperate things. A boxspring is a box with springs in it and a foundation is just a box. She told me that what i described doesn't exist even though i googled it for her and showed her on my phone. Even called another big name furniture company who told me they had what I described in stock. A second employee jumped in and told me that it doesn't exist as well. The manager told me she manages 6 stores and that she had never heard of such a thing. I told her I worked for the government and had seen incompetence promoted before. While this was going on, another gentleman came in and became upset because he paid for an item earlier in the day and they sold the item off the floor that had been promised to him. They informed him it would take weeks to get the item he had bought. Took the mattress set anyway. The end of the mattress is already starting to sag at less than 2 months. This happened at the store in Hagerstown, MD. Rude, dishonest, uneducated employees with an inferior product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T14:55:20.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

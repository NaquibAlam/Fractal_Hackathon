Paid Â£45 for 4 days which was extremely cheap however the insurance they tried to force me to take out was 96 euro and then there was a 26 euro charge for refuelling the car which is a bit of a joke. Apparently there was an option on the website to return the car full with no charge (I didn't see this) and when I said I'd return it full I was told it didn't matter as id be charged the 26 euro anyway. No cancellation was allowed so I decided to cut my losses at 40 quid and take a car out with autoriesen who were very helpful and much cheaper. All in all I'd avoid these gangsters if possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:02:39.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

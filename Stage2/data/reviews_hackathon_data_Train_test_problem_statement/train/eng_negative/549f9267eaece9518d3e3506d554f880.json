I asked to go back and retrieve them and they would not let me. First they told me they would be retrieved and left in the lost and found within 3 hours. Then they said they would email me within 3 to 5 business days letting me know if they had them. They ended up turning in the one iPad but not the other which doesn't make sense since they were together. When I tried to locate the lost and found Lufthansa employees were extremely rude and they didn't seem to know the process of getting my items from lost and found or exactly where lost and found was. If it's possible use a different airline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T08:58:03.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

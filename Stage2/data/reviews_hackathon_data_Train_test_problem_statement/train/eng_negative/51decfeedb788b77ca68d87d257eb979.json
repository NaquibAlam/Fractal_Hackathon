There was an option to pay an additional 20 or 25 euros for a \"service package\". Who thought i would need that service dearly? On the return flight, check-in luggage was not included. No problem, i thought, i have to book special luggage (ski equipment) for both flights anyway.\nI contacted SAS, unfortunately they referred me to Travelgenio.\nI was now at the mercy of Travelgenio, who would now make me pay 20 or 25 euro ON TOP OF what SAS and Norwegian would charge me for my special luggage on both flights and for the check-in bagage on the return flight. This is a case of hidden costs for an ordinary piece of check-in bagage. What do the other passengers do, dig a hole and bury their suitcase at Oslo Airport for the return flight?\nThe second complaint is that my travelcompanion Thias (see his one-star review below) paid 2x30 euro for his special luggage (which is the same as mine, a stack of ski-equipment) while i will be (EDIT: have been) charged 2x35 euro excl. \"service\" package. We have the same return flight, same airline, both booked through Travelgenio and both regret it.\nThe third and biggest complaint is the unbelievable effort it takes to communicate with the Travelgenio helpdesk. So many phonecalls, so many pending e-mails. After a week of silence I understandably get worried: am i waiting for them or are they waiting for me? Do i need to contact them in order to get the train going again? Have they understood what it is that i want them to do? (I am sure they have not. They will charge me for special luggage and forget to book the ordinary check-in luggage for the return flight, because it's too much information for them to process in one phone call and it is not mentioned in the e-mails i receive from them) All i need is a simple: yes, we're waiting for Norwegian/SAS to answer our email. Or: no, we cannot do anything because you have to pay for the \"service pack\" first. But all i hear is: we're so busy we cannot answer you, so you have to wait.\nYou are busy 1. because you are confused 2. because you cause confusion and 3. because you don't answer e-mails, which makes the customer send even more e-mails! I myself have worked at a helpdesk for many years, and I symphatize with you. Love, Thomas\nUPDATE: just removed one star, added fourth complaint because Travelgenio requested me to send them all my credit card details PER E-MAIL in order to complete the order. All arguing was futile, they left me no choice or I would have to pay double tariffs for my luggage and ski-equipment just before check-in at the airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:18:42.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

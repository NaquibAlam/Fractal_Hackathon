On day of release, I visited Ticketmaster's site to buy some tickets. A few clicks away I somehow end up on Ticketmaster Resale's site (due to tickets being sold out); I've never heard of Ticketmaster Resale, but as an affiliate of Ticketmaster I thought it'd be ok. So I bought the tickets during my brief moment of 'hype'.\nHere's the disappointment - during the transaction, there's no reasonable indication as to when you'll receive your ticket from the reseller, and the tickets listed on the site can be vague (i.e. no clarity on seat numbers). It should be made compulsory that a reseller upload copies of tickets when listing resale tickets so at the time of purchase, the purchaser has an actual copy of a ticket, proof that there's been a transfer of consideration between BOTH parties. After this whole experience and after speaking to multiple reps, I'm under the impression a seller can list whatever they like without actually having the tickets themselves; therefore how can a customer have confidence in what they're buying? This policy weighs heavily against consumers and should be reviewed - customer service advisors at the very least should be aware of this and suggest improvements/changes to management.\nMoney to the sum of approx. $1,200 has left my account for the last 3-4 months, with nothing to show except a pending order that hasn't been fulfilled.\nGet back to basics; listen to your customers, read all your reviews carefully, as the adage goes, \"the customer is always right\" - because this'll be the last time I deal with Ticketmaster irrespective of what tickets you're selling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T17:15:11.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

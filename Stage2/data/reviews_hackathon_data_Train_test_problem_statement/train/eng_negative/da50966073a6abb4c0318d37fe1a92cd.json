In the mean time, they keep on saying that they'll get to me in a day or two. When they did get back to me, the representative could not provide me with a tracking number for my loaner phone. I have been waiting for a for my loaner phone ever since. Every time I email them, they tell me they'll provide me with the tracking number after talking to their mailing department (Do yo even have one, I don't think so). If it's taking so much time to receive a loaner phone imagine how long will it take to get my phone repaired. I hate the service. I would give them 0 stars if possible.

I bought the ticket on the basis of a price that was clearly specified on the screen when I pressed 'payment' - in Australian dollars. This was also the price on the confirmation email that i received.\nA few days later when I checked my credit card details, the amount they debited was almost one hundred dollars more. I have written and called them and they do not even seem to comprehend my complaint because their responses are totally off topic.\nI buy flight tickets online all the time and this is the first company that has advertised one price and debited a higher amount. It seems they are not able to calculate exchange rates.\nDo not ever buy tickets through them as they have completely dishonest business practices and I will be definitely contacting the relevant authorities to inform them of this. They should not be allowed to run a business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T16:40:06.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Each representative I speak to (so far I think 7) have said they will pass my request for an alternative date to their \"specialist department\" urgently to get the date requested confirmed as the original alternative date offered was no good. Have spoken to the airline who say no one has approached them from Lastminute.com to request the change and this is 7 days later. I will never ever consider using this company again as mentioned if no changes then fine if any changes then they are useless absolutely would not recommend this company I dread to hear in the next 7 days if they can be bothered to get back to me. Never had such a bad experience, all I can say is stay away based on my experience I will see if I can get my solicitor involved as this has becomes the biggest farce which is not acceptable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T02:56:06.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

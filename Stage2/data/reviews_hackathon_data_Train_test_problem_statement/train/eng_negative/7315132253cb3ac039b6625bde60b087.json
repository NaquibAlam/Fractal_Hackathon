It's now Tuesday and my part still hasn't shipped. I did a live chat with Dominique who said she will keep an eye out for a tracking number when the supplier ships it. They won't change the shipping to next day, I had to choose that when I placed the order. First time ordering from Oscaro, and it definitely will be the last. Nothing worse then poor customer service. I'll go back to ordering from the other online parts stores that value their customers!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:45:29.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

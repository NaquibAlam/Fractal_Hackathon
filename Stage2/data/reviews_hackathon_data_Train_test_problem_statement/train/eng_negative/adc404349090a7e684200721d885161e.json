However, I received a voucher for one double superior and one double (which is much smaller) but was shockingly charged for two double superiors!!!! I have called and emailed the customer support team with a screenshot of the booking I was making (two double superiors confirming the price for each). They don't seem to understand the error and how this is completely unacceptable. The last email from the customer support team says there no are more double superiors avaliable, which is a massive disappointment as we were going away for my mums 65th birthday, but haven't not acknowedged that I have been overcharged!!!! Signed off with the following which is an absolute joke....\n'We have already sent your voucher by e-mail.\nThank you for using AMOMA.com and do not hesitate to call us back in order to make your reservations around the world.\nAMOMA.com wishes you an enjoyable stay!'\nWould not recommend as I have spent so much time with customer support with no resolution.\nSince posting this I received the message from amoma below. I tried the new email address to try and get this sorted but they replied with exactly the same response as previously.... telling me I have a voucher for a superior double and a normal double.... ending with AMOMA.com wishes you an enjoyable stay.\nWhere is my upgrade or refund\nThe way the company operates is a joke. Please do not waste your time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T18:00:58.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

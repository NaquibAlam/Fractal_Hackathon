Received mats of the correct shape but didn't fit into the clips on my cars floor. I contacted the company and over the course of 4 emails including pictures and a video they finally said \"do you want different fittings!\" - so \"yes\" I agreed \"I do want different fittings\". Now I've been driving around with them slipping around for nearly 2 weeks but today the different fittings arrived, and to be fair they are different, completely different from the fittings I need. I have emailed asking for a full refund.\nSo if you've just collected your new car and want luxury carpet mats specifically tailored to your car - give me a call as they may fit yours cos they don't fit mine!\nUPDATE - the reply posted below by car mats uk is actually quite funny \"human errors do occur\" yes one mistake is fair enough but when the mistake is pointed out you fix it, you don't send another wrong set and then refuse to refund as I've had the audacity to use the mats.\nDon't buy car mats from this company unless you like you're feet slipping about like Torvel and Dean as you try to brake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:56:10.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

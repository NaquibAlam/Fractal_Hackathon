Despite several calls to chase the delivery on the specific date the soundstore could not reach the courier from Dimplex and we had to send the gas installers away. After further chasing the cooker arrived the next day and we called out the gas installers once more. We then discovered that Glen Dimplex has not included the conversion kit to bottled gas and has to send the gas installers away once more. This was on a Wednesday. Soundstore contacted Dimplex who waited another day to put the adaptors in normal post which meant they would not arrive until the following Monday. On the Monday there were no adaptors in the post so soundstore had Dimplex send them by courier. Eventually the cooker was installed by the Thursday, 9 days late, incurring the cost of 3 gas fitter call outs and lots of chasing by us and soundstore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T03:34:40.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

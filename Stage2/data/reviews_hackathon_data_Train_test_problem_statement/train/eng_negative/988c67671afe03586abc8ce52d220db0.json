Three days later I received an email stating that one leg of my journey has been cancelled - but don't worry, they'll work with the airline to find me alternative flights (on a timescale of 7 days - way too long for me to go not knowing how I was getting there, having half a journey booked).\nI called their customer service line, and initially they offered me a refund for that leg of the journey but couldn't confirm how much it would be. I asked them to find out, and they agreed to contact me with alternative flights and the amount I would be refunded within 2 days.\nTwo days later I received a phone call informing me they're happy to give me a refund for my whole journey (okay, that's progress, but why couldn't they have told me that 2 days ago?!). They told me an administration fee of £18 would be taken from my refund, I argued it and they agreed to give me a full refund.\nNow I am being told that it could take months (one advisor told me up to 12 months?!) for my refund to be processed. I honestly wish I had never booked through lastminute.com, they have caused nothing but stress and problems for me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:57:41.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

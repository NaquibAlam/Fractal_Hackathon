I submitted my booking late on a Wednesday night, and by Monday end of business day, did not hear anything from the landlord. My agent was in touch briefly Thursday and Friday but as the 48 hour deadline came to a close Monday, I heard nothing.\nThe site should have a capability similar to Airbnb wherein applicants can directly message landlord's - already you can't visit the place or see it before you commit to a decent sum of money and booking a long-term home, this is the least that should be done. My agent was unable to reach the landlord, and I wasted a lot of time trying to plan around moving into this place as I have excellent references, and all required paperwork when moving into a new place (none of which was ever requested or passed on to the landlord).\nI will not be using the site again or recommending it, and was really interested in the property and now have to restart my housing search.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:35:05.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

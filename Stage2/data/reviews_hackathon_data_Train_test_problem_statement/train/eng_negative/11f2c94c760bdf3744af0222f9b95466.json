I heard about this company and asked for a Quote: .\nThe answer I got ? We don't have stock (but they still list thousands of units available through their network for the parts I requested), we usually provide higher quantities to large manufacturers, try Digikey (which of course can't provide this, and that person should know it damn well !).\nInteresting way to treat a customer.\nUPDATE: Following EARI's reply I feel the need to precise a few things:\n1°) There isn't any minimum order quantity stated on their website. Not at all.\n2°) Funny enough, there are a few reviews here on Truspilot talking about small quantity orders which were fulfilled smoothly\n3°) When digging a bit in those reviews, I see a few suspect points which let think a fair amount of them may have been written by the company itself.\n- There is never anything truly negative in their content, even in the few that are \"negative\"\n- Most of them are stated by people with a single review\n- Most of them happened at a very fast rate in limited time periods\nReaders will make their own opinion.\nI'd also like to add this review has nothing to do with frustration like it is insinuated. But the experience I had with this company contrasts so much with the image they want to show, that I felt this needed to be known.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T11:29:12.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

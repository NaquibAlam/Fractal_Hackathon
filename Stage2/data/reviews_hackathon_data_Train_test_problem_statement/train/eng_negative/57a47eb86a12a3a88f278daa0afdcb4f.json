It appears Marley Spoon subsidizes their orders by going in and reactivating your account once you have deactivated it and sending you a shipment and you are screwed either way. If you reject it because you did not order it they charge you anyway. So you end with nothing - no food and minus the cost of the food. Nice little business huh? Sad because the one time I tried it - it was pretty decent food. I deactivated when I lost my job and could not afford to continue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:03:05.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They claim to be REAL, yet the majority of the time their predictions do not happen. They save themselves by putting a Disclaimer at the bottom of their page saying that they are for \"entertainment purposes only\" i.e. completely discrediting themselves at the same time as saying that they are the \"REAL DEAL\"\nWhen I try to get refunds from Kasamba for some of the money I have wasted on fakes, they ignore my requests, not even send an email. Kasamba needs to step up and take responsibility for the scammers on their site because many hard workers are losing money by contacting these fake readers who give people false hope. I would say only one or two psychics on this site seem genuine and some predictions have happened, but for the most part, even the ones who seem the most real, are fake and just tell you what you want to hear. I also find it hard to believe that many of these psychics get 5* from customer reviews as I have rated some readers with a 1* or 2* and it does not show up in the ratings for others to see (the readings were more than 5 minutes in length). Kasamba messes around with the rating system as well so some readers look like they are rated higher than they actually are, so beware.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T23:34:41.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

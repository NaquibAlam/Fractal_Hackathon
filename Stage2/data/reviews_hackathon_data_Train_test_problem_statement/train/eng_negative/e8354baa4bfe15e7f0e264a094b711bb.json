The delivery was on point. But the quality of the dresses are very poor! I was in question about one of the dresses as far as the Color. It's description was Nude. When I called promgirl I wanted to be sure that the Color was as they stated. She said as far she could see it was nude. Not the case, when the dress arrived it is a bright peach Color. I paid extra shipping of $17 to get the dress fast only to be disappointed . I emailed PromGirl to see if they can refund me in full for this particular dress because I called to have specified on the Color before I placed the order. I especially would of like a refund for the extra cost in shipping. But the failed to email be back. So I was stuck with the restocking fee along with the extra shipping cost.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:16:19.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

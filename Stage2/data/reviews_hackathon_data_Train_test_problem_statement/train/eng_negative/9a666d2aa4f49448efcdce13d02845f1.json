I setup shipping from US to Korea and it wouldn't let me print the label. Customer service non existent unless you are willing to wait a day for any response. They promised me my money back but still haven't seen refund for my first try. Turns out the address line was over its limit so I decided to give a second chance. Boy what a mistake that was. My box got shipped to the IL facility but no one seems to know where my box is. They emailed me and told me they would look into it and that was 2 days ago. Save yourself the headache and worry and just go with USPS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T15:12:19.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

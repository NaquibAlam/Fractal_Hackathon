I was very pleased with the mechanic that installed the device. He was knowledgable and up to date on how the device worked. Everything seemed like it was gonna be ok until I left the garage.\nThe next day (day 2 of using the device) I blew into the device and tried starting the car, it said start your vehicle. Turn the key nothing I called customer service number was on hold for almost an hour before someone answered. I explained what had happened she said sounds like a technicale problem. She transferred me to another person. I was on hold for almost another hour. I was already Late for work now by this time I had to call out of work loosing over 200$ in pay!! Arri helped me go through all the trouble shooting that we could do. Including unhooking the battery for 20 min and doing everything over again. She informed me that I will have to have the car towed back to the service center where I got it installed. So now I have to loose another day of pay and pay a tow truck driver and after paying for the installation I'm almost broke. The only thing that would change my opionion of all this is if I was re imburrsed for my loss of pay and tow truck.

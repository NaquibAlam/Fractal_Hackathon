It was a wonderful service and solved so many problems for me. What is there now is not Skype. It does not deserve the name. Its disappearing makes me sad. It was a good thing.\nWhat is there now is some version of a non communication nightmare that has no real customer service but rather endless loops. It is possible that you will be charged for something you do not want to be charged for. It is unlikely you will be able to file the form to get it back. You will want to close your account. You will become bewildered about how to do so. You will try and try to follow the loop to customer support, be forced to join Microsoft something or other while so doing. That will not help you. You will be switched back and forth across web and non-web Skype and into microsoft verification forms endlessly.\nI largely feel neutral about Bill Gates and how he has earned his fortune and then gives from it. I did admire the giving piece. This fake Skype changed that for me. His affiliation with this product, bewilders me. It is truly terrible now and feels like it steals from people by how it charges and evades - recourse. He would do well to discontinue his affiliation with it soon before it really damages his reputation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T23:49:45.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

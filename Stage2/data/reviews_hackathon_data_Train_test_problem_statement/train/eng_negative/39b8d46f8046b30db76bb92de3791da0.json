I was gladly surprised by the price and online reviews that I went along with it thinking this would be a great experience, I was highly mistaken. At first, everything went smoothly and I received an email stating my iPhone 6 Plus was unlocked from the current carrier I was using and only a few days after the purchase, I couldn't have been more pleased. I took my phone into the new carrier I wanted to go with and set up my phone and all was great up until I tried using the SIM card I was given, it contiusoulsy said that the SIM card isn't valid with the carrier. I email them after trying everything I could possible over two days and all they could say is they will try again because it didn't work the first time , and so they did. I waited two weeks without a word of how my phone was doing and then emailed them wanting an update on my phone and again they said they were trying. I was extremely frustrated so I emailed them back asking for a refund multiple times as they say on their website they will if they cannot unlock the phone , which they hadn't. They emailed me back saying again that they are trying to fix it even though I didn't ask them to because I just wanted my money back for the three weeks wasted. I emailed them again today and no response from them even though they have a 24/7 online service and have responded to my first few emails within 15 mins of sending them ( was the best thing about them but not anymore). I am completely disappointed in service , left frustrated and confused with no answers. I feel they are taking my money and ignoring me so they don't have to refund me. This was a waste of $42! Worst experience I've ever had, don't use doctorSIM!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:32:41.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Since it's purchase and activation it continues to say not reporting. We have gone through all of the help documents and regardless of whether or not the product is in or outside, it is not reporting.\nCurrently, the lights indicate no GPS even though, according to the coverage maps on their site via Tmobile, we are located in a area with full 2g coverage. We purchased the tracker from amazon and are returning the as product is not reliable and does not work as advertised.\nWhat is ridiculous is that in order to even know if the product will work you must sign up for service prior to even testing the tracker for reliability and accuracy. Additionally, the only way to contact support is via a pre-generated contact us email form that continues to recommend you to a place on the help blog and never actually responds. According to their website they cannot (will not) refund amounts of purchased plans once paid for and in order to discover whether or not the tracker works you must purchase the service plans!\nThe website is misleading with information it provides to the consumer and makes it really hard to understand your options with purchasing service.\nI am very tech savvy and have worked with several other tracking devices (very successfully) and was hoping this would work to track my pet effectively and accurately, needless to say this product is not one I would recommend at all!\nAdditionally, customer service is horrible, they only communicate via email and even then do not seem to resolve the problems with applicable answers. They also takes days to respond!\nIf you value your money and do not want to lose it: DO NOT BUY\nPS. I found this company Contact info on CrunchBase\nPluskaufstrasse 7\nBusiness Center\n4.

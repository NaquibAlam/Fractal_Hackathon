In 15 years having welcomed more than 50 expats\nsolved A lot of problems of tenants , never had a bad feedback or a bad experience and still in contact with several . My add was put on line without having watched it first . I have been proposed a booking on a room with the wrong pictures or the wrong price , then with wrong dates . After 1 month I have finally access to my landlord space 3on 4 rooms show booked which isn't reality . I met 3 tenants who all felt abused by SPOTAHOME. By keeping in touch with tenants we realized SPOTAHOME uses a double language ( one to the tenant a other to the landlord when solving a problem they crated ) BE VERY CAREFULLY : co housing is about sharing and living together it is not ment to be a business because it is about people ! My health really suffered from these experiences as I also lost a lot of time , and at the end ... we had an experience : YES! : but not a good one . I can accept it is a Start for SPOTAHOME belgium : but when the mistakes continue ....To all futur tenants in Brussels : please \"BE AWAIRE\" ! J.C.V.D .To SPOTAHOME : it is really time to get your act together and lurn from your mistakes .At this time I really can not recommend you .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T16:21:12.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I ordered a really expensive brush and compressor combo. They pretty quickly emailed me back to say the brush was out of stock. Irritating because they could have just updated their website to reflect that status but they let me order anyway. I responded to their email and asked them to please cancel the order as I needed the items quickly and I would be able to get them elsewhere. No response to my email.\nThe following day I called their customer service number. I talked to someone who was rude, hardly listened to me and then without any info aside from my order number- told me I would get a refund \"in a couple of days\". That was 12 days ago.\nThey no longer respond to emails and no one answers their phone. I left voicemail and attempted to use their web based chat too. Nothing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:55:02.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

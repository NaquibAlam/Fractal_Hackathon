I got a strange email from Blume2000 late in the day telling me my girlfriend was actually in Denmark and they were going to destroy my flowers and charge me. I think we would know where my girlfriend was! I emailed them back almost immediately and still haven't heard back, days later! I'm really upset at not just the fact that the flowers weren't delivered, but the follow up service. I entered my phone number during ordering. The least they could have done is call to confirm where my girlfriend was before destroying the flowers. I won't be ordering from Blume2000 again.\nGareth", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:28:09.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Upon receiving the phone back the first time, I noticed the new battery never held a charge. I called the company and they asked me to return the phone for warranty work. I did so and they again claimed to fix it. When I got the phone back this time, in addition to not holding a charge, the phone also began to randomly turn on and off. I the contacted the company again, and I was promised I would have my phone call returned on Monday of the following week. I had not heard from them by Wednesday, so I call back and the lady I spoke with would not apologize for not keeping their promise to return my call. She did offer to fix the phone again. I sent it to them for a third time. Again the phone is holding a charge significantly shorter then when I first gave them the phone, and I still have the charge from their \"repair.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:31:09.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

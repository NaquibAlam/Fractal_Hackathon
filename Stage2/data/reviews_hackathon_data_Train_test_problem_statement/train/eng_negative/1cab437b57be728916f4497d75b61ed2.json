I was very disappointed that I tried to shop the \"semi annual sale\" and buy a few sale items but also use my credits towards the mandatory 49.95 items and it wouldn't let me, I had to either apply the promotional price, OR use my member credits. I guess I would have had to do 2 separate orders, one all sale items, and one regular priced items with my credits, and then probably would had to pay shipping since it would be two orders.

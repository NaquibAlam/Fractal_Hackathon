I paid with a $30 gift card I bought on groupon plus an additional $22. on my charge. The problems started with an email saying the florist was unable to process the order. It left me with the option to Send a nice surprise bouquet or a florist choice bouquet. Neither of which had a picture or description. I paid for a bouquet with roses I wanted roses in it not a florist choice for daisies. Called Teleflora and they told me the florist didn't have some of the flowers. I told them it was fine to substitute colors and flowers but they needed to assure that there were roses in it since that is what I paid for. I then googled and was able to find the Telaflora florist in my MIL's small town. Called her directly she told me she had all the flowers needed for the order as it was pictured but couldn't process it because Teleflora was offering her $25 for the order including delivery and she couldn't do it for that amount of money. I told her this was between them and that I as the customer shouldn't be fighting this battle. She assured me that she would contact them. She contacted them they agreed to the price that she needed but never sent the paperwork. She made the arrangement on their verbal agreement and waited. Several hours later thinking everything was taken care of I got another call from Teleflora telling me we have to substitute for cheaper flowers or pay $20 more. It took me over an hour of them telling me that the florist didn't have the flowers and to substitute and me calling the florist directly while on my landline with telaflora and playing a game of he said she said. One of them was clearly lying. After an hour Teleflora paid the florist the money needed for the original order I placed and the florist sent out the order as pictured on the Teleflora website. Upon reading other complaints this seems to be an ongoing problem with Teleflora", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T10:37:18.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

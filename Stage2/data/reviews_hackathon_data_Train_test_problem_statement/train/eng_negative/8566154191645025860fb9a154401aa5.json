I had purchased a large pizza and the contents of this was cold and sauce was overloaded dripping all over the floor. The pasta was dry and also cold in the middle, so not saucy at all and the Garlic bread burnt. Very long wait times aswel was going to get this delivered, paid for it online and the wait time was 1 hour 40 minutes, far too long to wait with kids, so had to go in and pick it up and noticed on the window it stated staff wanted delivery drivers and Junior staff. Was unsure if understaffed hence waiting this long. We paid $46 all up and highly disgusted with what we received. Seeking a refund, paid online via eat now.It definately was not worth the money and food was put in the bin as it wasnt cooked and as it was full of cheese and chicken couldnt risk food poisoning as we have young children.We had requested delivery as our familys down with the flu. Please refund our money, was such a disappointing experience and we now have to seek other food as we are hungry. We are regular customers so im not sure whats happened. I have logged a refund with Paypal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T21:10:52.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Yes, I did so correctly, I didn't put any in the middle hole like many people often mistake.\nIt was after this that the pen then started leaking, even though I had not even used it, and the top then began to keep spinning like I had mentioned above.\nI contacted customer service.\nFirst of all, even though my pen was disgusting from the leak and oil had leaked all over the outside and inside, customer service decided to only send a new tank.\nThe tank they sent, even though they had my order number, was for a different pen.\nThey are now avoiding me at all costs. I have not received anything more even though I have contacted them multiple times. This is the worst customer service morals I've ever had to deal with.\nWhen you get a faulty item that you paid for, you get a new one in order to get your actual moneys worth. I've pretty much given 75 dollars to Vapornation for free.\nThat is criminal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T13:28:38.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This time they won't even CARE about helping me! I booked a return flight EZE – MAD with two connection flights.\n***original ticket - last two legs of the return journey\n18:10 Sao Paulo Guarulhos International - GRU\nWait: 5hrs 15mins\n23:25 Sao Paulo Guarulhos International - GRU\nAerolineas Argentinas - (AR1243)\n02:20 Sun 23 Apr 2017\nBuenos Aires Ministro Pistarini - EZ\nA day after I confirmed my reservation, I receive an email from them saying one of the connection flights of my return journey (SAU PAULO – BUENOS AIRES) had been cancelled by the airline and that they had no alternative flight to offer me, just a refund for that part of the journey. So they actually offered me to depart from BUENOS AIRES but come back to SAO PAULO and stay there. Not very helpful.\nI had to call and talk to THREE different agents until one ofthem was good enough like for referring my case to another department to find me an alternative flight. They came back to me two days after with an alternative flight that suit us perfectly and we confirmed this option.\n***confirmation of amended flight - last two legs of the return journey\nAD7219 ***22APR*** PORTO PORTUGAL - SAO PAULO GUARULH 1130 1810\nAR7725 ***22APR*** SAO PAULO GUARULH - BUENOS AIRES 2015 2305\nSoon after this confirmation, I receiver yet another message from lastminute saying that my flight has been changed to again to another one with 13 hour layover in Sao Paulo. No accommodation for the 13 hours layover was offered or anything to help the circumstantes. I called the airline and they told me there is availability on the fight they originally moved us to (AR7725) and it was not them changing our flight, but the agency from which we bought the tickets: lastminute.com. I called them again to try to find a reasonable alternative flight with less layover and after four days they came back saying they have no alternative flights and they can only refund me, which is not a solution as they ticket is now much more expensive than it was offered when I bought it approximately a month ago.\n***third change on my original itinerary with 13 hours layover - last two legs of the return journey\nAD7219 ***22APR*** PORTO PORTUGAL - SAO PAULO GUARULH 1130 1810\nAR1249 ***23APR*** SAO PAULO GUARULH - BUENOS AIRES AEP 0700 0955\nThere are TWO alternative flights for the 22nd that would allow us to come back home on the 22nd as we originally planned to. Both flights are from Aerolineas Argentinas which is the airline we had the original flight that was cancelled with. I checked with them and there is availability on both flight so if the airline canceled our flight, and they have availability the same day *they still have* and we were already in one of them, why did lastminute changed us again to a WORSE flight with THIRTEEN HOURS LAYOVER? These are the flights available that day, the first one is where we were already moved to but then CHANGED again.\n• AR7725 22APR SAO PAULO GUARULH - BUENOS AIRES 2015 2305\n• AR1245 22APR SAO PAULO GUARULH - BUENOS AIRES 1900 2155\nThe customer care representatives have been mostly rude and useless to give a solution to a problem which was already resolved before they amended my itinerary for a third time! I DO NOT RECOMMEND LASTMINUTE.COM. They will just take your money and rip you off. No customer care as they simple DON’T care once they took your money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:05:29.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

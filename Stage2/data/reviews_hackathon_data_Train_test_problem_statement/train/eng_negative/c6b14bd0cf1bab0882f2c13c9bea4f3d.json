Add claimed to be inspected and 100% functional. Drone was delivered within a few days and upon receipt I opened the box with excitement. As I pulled the drone from the backpack container I noticed the camera hanging by its wires. I inspected the drone further and found one of the landing struts to be broke in two places. I called Beach and the first thing they asked was had I crashed the drone. The Fed Ex man was just leaving. I powered on the drone and tried to fire up the motors which failed and the drone went into a error mode. I finally opened the propeller box to find 3 of the 6 propellers broke. The point being that they did not even open this thing up after the original owner crashed it and returned it. I then offered to buy a new drone and have them refund the difference. The answer I got was our system does not work that way. I was not very happy with my experience with Beach Camera. They did send a prepaid label to send it back. Be very careful with their open box items!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:48:21.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Firstly, there was a huge delay in sending items. Order dates and despatch days are weeks apart. Great service of 'returns' but foolishly I thought that would mean an exchange for the right size. After reordering the item returned, I got notice a few weeks after it wasn't in stock and due back in April 2017. I'm in desperate need of a strapless bra, which I ordered but that must have been removed due to lack of stock aswell, as I've just stopped breastfeeding and would like to wear strapless things to feel feminine, but again I've been disappointed by the stock counts. I order online, as it is the only way to get items, and I feel very isolated and disappointed with Zodee standards of service and emails.\nFinally, don't send 'Hello Fresh' cards to people who can't use them. There is not one WA delivery area, so why just make it more upsetting for us western folks?! I can't even give it to my family members in Perth! üòÅ I guess I'll have to reorder (& wait for disappointment plus pay extra - not on sale & delivery - to get the strapless bra I need. üò°\nRegards Tracey", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T19:11:26.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I first talked to them I said I was going to shop around and get back to them whenever I decided. They took that as, \"Hey, let's call him every single day until he makes a decision.\"\n2. I called to set up a switch over on a Friday. The guy who I talked to took my $50 payment and then said he was going to set me up. He told me he would call me back when it was confirmed. He never called me back. I tried calling on Monday and got a bunch of people that would keep me on hold and/or transfer me to a voicemail of someone I didn't know. Nobody could give me answers. Then when I got in touch with the original guy I spoke to he passed the blame onto someone named Amber. I spent well over an hour on the phone with these people and most of them were rude.\n2 people that were not rude were Amber and Jackie. Both ladies were extremely helpful and nice as they could possibly be. Together, they ended up getting me taken care of, but overall a terrible first experience with this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:37:52.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

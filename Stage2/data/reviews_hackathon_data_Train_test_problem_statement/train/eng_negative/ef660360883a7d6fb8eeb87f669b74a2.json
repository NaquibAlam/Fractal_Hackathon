I have job interview with Alberta Sheriffs on march 3 at 10;30 am. so now i don't have enough money to book another flight and the refund will take 5 to 10 days to shows on my account. My future depends on this interview now i have to figure a way to make it to Alberta.\nI will give no star if I can. don't waist your money and time go directly to the airline website", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T17:46:58.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

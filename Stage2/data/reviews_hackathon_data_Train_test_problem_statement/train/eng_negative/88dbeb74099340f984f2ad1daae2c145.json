When it finally shipped, I called FedEx to get an estimated time of arrival, and they told me that the package was sent through regular service, not expedited and that I would not get it on time. I emailed Tomtop, one week later and still no response. I tried the chat many times and it failed to work until today when I finally could get in contact with them. They were of no help, simply saying that the fact they shipped it with FedEx and not USPS justified the extra charge and made it priority. Then, in the middle of the chat, they just stopped answering, I truly doubt it had anything to do with the connection, they simply chose to ignore me.

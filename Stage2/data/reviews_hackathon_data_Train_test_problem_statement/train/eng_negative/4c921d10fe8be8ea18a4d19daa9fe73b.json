In 2006, PAYPAL restricted my account for \"violating their acceptable use policy...\" with ABSOLUTELY EXPLANATION OR DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED...\nNow, this creates a problem for me as I buy and sell on Ebay and use PayPal as my method of transferring and receiving money...\nFast forward about 5 years...I opened another PayPal account with a new email address...\nI use this account for HUNDREDS of transactions with ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS!!\nALL of a sudden...without notice...PayPal restricts this account as well...again...with NO DOCUMENTATION OR EXPLANATION!\nI opened a THIRD ACCOUNT...and after 2 weeks...the same thing...it's restricted!!!\nI contact PayPal dozens of times by email and phone...and all I get is APPEAL DENIED FORM emails back!\nI even send them documentation of my identity theft issue from the FTC and the Connecticut State Police...still...APPEAL DENIED!!!\nFinally, I contacted a private attorney and he advised me that PayPal is a state and/or federally regulated financial institution and BY LAW...I am entitled to a copy of detailed documentation of ALL financial transactions conducted in my name...\nSo...I send PayPal a letter by certified mail requesting this information...\nThey received it and signed for it on January 30th...and it is now March 8th...and no response...except for another (4th or 5th) appealed denied email signed by \"Paul\"...\nSo, today I sent another request letter by certified mail...we'll just have to see IF and/or WHEN they respond back to me!\nIn closing, it sucks that I have been a victim of identity theft to begin with...and it has been an absolute NIGHTMARE for 20+ years now...but it's even WORSE to be VICTIMIZED all over again by a company that doesn't give a damn about their customers that patronize them!\nI think it is EXTREMELY ANNOYING, CHILDISH, AND UNPROFESSIONAL that a company would not respond to REPEATED requests for information to help me clear my name!\nI also makes me wonder about their CREDIBILITY AND WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO HIDE!\nIt also angers me that a company would rather battle it out in court than to resolve a real simple issue...\nI know that big companies like PayPal don't care about us \"small guys\" and that if they ignore me me or complicate the \"process\" that I will just give up and go away...\nWELL...PayPal doesn't know me very well...because the more they play their corporate games...the harder I will fight for the answers I need!\nI would ask each and every person that reads this review to consider your business relationship with PayPal...NOW or in the future...\nDO YOU REALLY WANT TO SUPPORT AND DO BUSINESS WITH A COMPANY THAT CARES ONLY ABOUT THEIR BOTTOM LINE...AND NOT CONSUMERS???\nKevin Wetherbee", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:32:47.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

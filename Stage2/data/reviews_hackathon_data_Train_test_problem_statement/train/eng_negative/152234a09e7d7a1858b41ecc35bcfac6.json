Apparently, I didn't order the \"HQ label\" even though nothing in the proof showed me how pixelated and noisy it would actually show. It took 3 different revisions to get it right.\nThe 3rd order in Dec. 2015 was forgotten about...? I had to send a message to a rep who then placed the order again.\nThis last order included a booklet. The pdf supplied were up to specs (300dpi, etc.) but it came out fuzzy. And though it was in full color, the last page (which was intentionally greyscale) looked the worst out of all of them - the text is pretty ineligible.\nDoubt I'll ever order from Discmakers again. I've spent nearly $2000 and have been disappointed each time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T02:03:52.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

First of all, the scratches.\nCar was full of scratches (it was marked in the contract) when we received it and we have paper from Goldcar where it is marked. Unfortunately we could not come back to the office to change the car as we had three small kids under 4 years old with us. When we returned car (daytime 11:30) , person who received it had no complains about car condition and accepted it.\nWe used car only for going to/from airport, supermarket and back to hotel. Car was most of the time parked on the IFA Buenaventura hotel parking.\nThere was no hurricane or other bad weather conditions that could add any scratches to the roof. So we suppose that this scratches were there already when we got Ford at the airport.\nFrom the pictures you have sent to us we can not see that this is roof or the roof of exactly this car. It can be any place of the car or any other car as well.\nWe would like to get whole deposit back as we have not done any damage to this car.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:37:15.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

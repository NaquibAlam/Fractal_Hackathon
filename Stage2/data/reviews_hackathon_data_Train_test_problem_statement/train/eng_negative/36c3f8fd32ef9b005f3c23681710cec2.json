THIS CANT BE A REAL BUSINESS. NOT MOBILE FRIENDLY NOT COMPUTER FRIENDLY NOT TABLET FRIENDLY. LAGS AND FREEZES OVER AND OVER, CLICKS RANDOM BUTTONS YOU NEVER PRESSED. FINALLLY GOT THROUGH AND FOUND A PAIR OF GLASSES, WENT TO ORDER AND BY THE END THE ORDER SWITCHED THE COLOR I WANTED, TRIED 4 TIMES, FINALLY GOT THE RIGHT COLOR AT THE END THE LAST TIME. ALSO COULDNT SEARCH ANYTHING IN THE SEARCHBAR EVEN WITH THE EXACT TITLE OF THE GLASSES IN THE DESCRIPTION. WENT TO ORDER, EXPECTED TO PAY SHIPPING. PROCESSING E WAS $2, ALL OF A SUDDEN I ENTER MY VOUCHER INFO AND PROCESSING FEE GOES UP $10 AND I HAVE TO PAY FOR SHIPPING ON TOP OF THAT. DIDNT GO THROUGH WITH THE DUMB ORDER BY THE END OF IT. VERY SCAMMY, VERY UNRELIABLE. I WILL NEVER USE THIS WEBSITE AGAIN AND I URGE YOU NOT TO AS WELL IT IS NOT WORTH THE HASSLE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:50:54.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

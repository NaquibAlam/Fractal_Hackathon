When we contacted our phone network they informed us that the phone was now blacklisted due to the previous owner and we would need to speak to CEX. The phone had cost over £400 and we had our receipt and a 24 month warranty, but was told that we would only receive £375.00 back either as a refund or a credit voucher. We wanted to buy another phone, so they gave us a credit and we ordered another phone the same as before and when it arrived it would not hold a charge. We took this one back to the store and have now purchased another phone. This one is working, but have lost a lot of faith in purchasing through this store.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T23:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T11:28:41.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

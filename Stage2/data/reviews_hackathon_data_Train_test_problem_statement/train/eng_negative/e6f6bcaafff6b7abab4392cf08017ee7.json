Then we had to move a box interstate and we were told we could have it delivered to the Byron Bay Area. We paid for the redelivery to Brisbane and were told they couldnt deliver our box to Byron because it was outside of there redelivery radius. So we had to pay more cash for someone to bring us the contents. If we had known we would have had a removal company do the move for us at a much lower cost, so it wasn't cost effective in the end. Kind of annoying. Taxibox should not give out information and then not be able to follow through, or atleast train there staff properly to how exactly they operate. Probably won't use them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T10:48:22.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I am a merchant and received a negative product review from a customer who had not received any products from us as he had not paid for the order. The customer was contacted to determine how we could assist him and if perhaps there was some mix up. The wash up was he said he would think about paying for his order.\nWe reported this product review as he the customer had not received and products from us. Trust Pilot then offered the customer who had not ordered from us to give us a 'service' review.\nWe then receive an 1 star (negative) 'service' review from a non-paying customer who had not received any goods not any service from us except trying to assist and clarify with the customer a negative product review on products never received.\nWow! is all I can say. I accept negative reviews if we have done something wrong - or the customer does not get a pleasurable experience but that is just rank!!!\nCustomer Placed Order. Customer Did Not Pay For Order. We Did Not Ship Goods. TrustPilot considers this providing a good or service?

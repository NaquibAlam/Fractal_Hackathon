I ordered them at night and they were delivered to my friend in Luxembourg the next morning. I was pleased with the quick service.\nHowever, I am giving two stars only because the flowers that were delivered (\"Pink Cloud\" for the birth of a girl) did not remotely resemble the online product image. The image was of pink flowers, with minimal greenery and small white flowers. The flowers that were delivered were pink, light purple, dark purple, and yellow. There was also a lot of greenery.\nI understand that the actual product may differ from the image, depending on seasonal availability -- but I expected most, if not all, of the flowers to be pink.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T06:57:20.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

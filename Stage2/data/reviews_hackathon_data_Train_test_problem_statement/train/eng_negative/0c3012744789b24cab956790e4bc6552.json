I phoned to ask for a reimbursement for my flights and they kept giving me the run around. They told me I had to deal with the airline company, not them. So I phoned the airline company and sat on hold for 40 minutes so they could tell me no I had to deal with flight hub. So back to flight hub, they told me the same thing. So I phoned the airline company again and sat on hold for another 40 minutes before they told me no contact Flight Hub. On the third time phoning flight hub, I spoke to a lady and asked her to talk to the manager, she was great she asked what was wrong. I explained the situation to her, she got the airline company on the other line and straightened it all out with all three of us on the phone. It took a total of 4 hours straight phoning back and forth. Not very customer friendly with the first two employees arguing with me on the phone, but the third was awesome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:03:17.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I called customer service and had the worst experience I can ever recall. My initial intention was to re-book it in the am after sorting out a work schedule issue. The website clearly states that cancellations within 4 hrs are subject to no fee for anyone, and in Canada within 24hrs. I painfully tried to explain this to the initial rep and then his supervisor, detailing where to go on their website, counting paragraphs to guide them to the relevant part of the \"terms & conditions\" document\", and so on. It was a terrible experience that lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes (recorded on my phone) and left me frustrated, lacking confidence in the knowledge, expertise or courteousy of flighthub employees, and unfortunately never wanting to ever use flighthub again. There was no apology offered at the end, once the supervisor acknowledged that I was right, and there was no offer of a compensation for my wasted time and being up until 1am because of this unpleasant experience. Disappointment is an understatement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T16:54:00.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

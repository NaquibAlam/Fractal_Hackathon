After several days my order hadn't arrived so sent them an email. No response, so eventually found their phone number as the one listed on their website was out of service.\nEnquired where my order was and was told they are due in soon. The person hung up on me when I pointed out that they were still showing as being in stock on their website.\nI called back an got through to a different representative who told me that they may not be getting them back at all!!\nThe product was still 'in stock' several weeks later too!!\nEventually received a refund, but was severely cheesed off at being lied to and the time wasted chasing up this order.

All three times there were problems.\nThe rental in Spain was the worst. The day after I picked up the car, I drove to Murcia, and less than an hour after I parked, the car vanished without a trace. In spite of paying for full coverage insurance and being assured that the theft was covered, when they found the car two months later, miles from where I'd parked, I was told that the insurance wouldn't cover it because the police couldn't prove the car had been stolen. They put the onus on me to prove I hadn't been where the car had been found. They said I had to pay a €1500 fine to cover the time the car was out of service, or else they'd press charges. I balked at first, but then, knowing that court proceedings were impractical since I didn't live there, and not wanting to be banned from Spain if I ignored it, I talked them down to an €800 fine. I still don't know what happened to the car, but given that Goldcar has an office in Murcia and there was reportedly no damage to the vehicle (and almost all my things were still inside), I wouldn't be surprised if it were an inside job... but only God knows for sure. Suffice it to say, the insurance (which doubled the cost of the rental) was worthless. Between the rental cost, the fine and the extra return flight to pick up my things, it cost me well over €1000 for a single day of driving.\nI later rented in Venice, and it was also a debacle, but for different reasons. They tried to push the full coverage insurance on me, saying \"if you don't take it, you'll be sorry\" (really honest, that)... but the rates were outrageous, roughly double the rental price, so I refused it, figuring from my previous experience that it wasn't good for much anyway. At this point, they went to take the deposit, and proceeded to tell me they wouldn't accept any credit card that wasn't a chip-and-pin, they wouldn't take any AmEx, and they wouldn't take a debit card. Suddenly I found I had no way to pay. But they said if I took the full coverage, then they could charge that to any card. Ha - what a coincidence! In the end, I paid it, since it was summertime and the competition was completely sold out. The trip and return went fine, but what a ripoff.\nMy latest experience was in Malta, with Rhodium (Goldcar's premium brand, it turns out), and fortunately it was somewhat better than the previous experiences. They didn't try to force the full coverage insurance on me, but they did advise that the deposit would be held for 30 days (why so long?). I was also charged a separate €50 out-of-hours fee which wasn't included in the rate I'd booked, and wasn't mentioned anywhere in the reservation documentation. The car itself had filthy windows, the low tire pressure light was on (for all 4 tires), and it acted like it was about to stall, in spite of not having very many miles on it. The maintenance standard certainly left something to be desired.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T22:40:46.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

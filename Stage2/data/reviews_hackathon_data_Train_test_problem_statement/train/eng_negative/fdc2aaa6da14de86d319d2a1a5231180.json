They notified me the same day that they didn't have the compressor in stock and that it would be shipping from Iwata. The airbrush itself and my accessories shipped within a day or so and arrived within the week. My problem started with the accessories. I ordered an extra cup & lid system (fine) and a lid for the cup the brush came with. Well, it turned out there was a mistake on their website, so I thought the airbrush came with a 1/4 oz cup when it actually came with a 1/8 oz cup. Based on the information on the website I'd ordered the 1/4 oz lid, which naturally didn't fit. Before I noticed the error on the website, I called them up to tell them my lid wasn't working/did't fit and the guy who answered just didn't really want to hear what I had to say and told me to call the manufacturer (like he just assumed I had a defective product - I don't, I have the wrong product). While I had him on the line, I asked about how long I should expect it to take for the compressor to arrive, again he referred me to Iwata and said I could ask them that when I called about the cup. I shrugged it off thinking I'd gotten the fulfillment guy who really didn't know the answers, so after I got off the line I did some poking around and realized what the problem was. I sent CAS an email explaining it and with a picture. No answer. So I called again and left a voicemail. No answer. So I emailed again. No answer. So I sent a message through their website. No answer. So I just called again and their voicemail box is full. Clearly, I am not the only one having a problem. This is disappointing because their prices are competitive and I like supporting small businesses, but this has been really frustrating. This should be an easy fix. Incidentally, about a week after I placed my order I called Iwata for a status update. The woman I spoke to was really helpful. They did have my order, but the compressors are back-ordered. Iwata is expecting a shipment early this week and told me to call back on Friday to see if my unit has shipped yet. Glad I called otherwise I'd have been sitting here wondering if my unit was walking from Oregon to New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:52:54.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

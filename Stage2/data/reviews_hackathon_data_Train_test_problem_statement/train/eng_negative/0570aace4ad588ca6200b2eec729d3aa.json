Northstar management refused to fix that and says its Ski.com's fault. So I wrote to Ski.com and got nothing but an automated response, apparently indicating that my assigned travel agent there is out for a few days. Skiing maybe?\nRedeeming Ski.com's lift ticket vouchers at Northstar was an incredible hassle. We actually went in to the ticket office late in the day before we wanted to start skiing to make sure that went OK. The kid at the counter had to consult with a manager to figure out what to do, and it took about half an hour. At the gondola the next morning, only one of our lift passes actually worked! We had to dig up the reservation out of email on an iPhone and blow the first half hour of our skiing time getting it fixed.\nIf you are headed for Northstar it seems the odds are pretty high that you'll be treated badly if you book through Ski.com.

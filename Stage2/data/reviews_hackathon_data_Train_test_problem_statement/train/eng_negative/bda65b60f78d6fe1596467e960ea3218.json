The company (Air Canada) changed the flight times, to an untenable flight time. Air Canada told me to speak to the Travelgenio, I spoke with Travelgenio, the man I spoke with was very hard to understand and offered no help whatsoever apart from you can apply for a refund, but you might not get it.\nWell I need a flight as it is a connection flight, I asked if they could make another booking (with another company who I saw on their website had flights at a suitable time) with a refundable option (as I can't afford to pay for 2 lots of flights) and they said they couldn't do that, reiterated my two options were apply for a refund or accept the flight. No attempt to help, I asked to speak to a supervisor and was refused, then he hung up on me.\nAbsolutely no help at all, got a call recording if anyone wants to hear my experience firsthand!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:25:47.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

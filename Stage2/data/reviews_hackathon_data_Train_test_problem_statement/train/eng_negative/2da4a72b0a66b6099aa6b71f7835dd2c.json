The tap sold to me for low pressure turned out to be not fit for purpose. After ordering from the showroom I was told everything is dealt with by customer service.\nIn April 2016 after numerous communications to customer services I finally received a letter from the customer service office manager agreeing the taps sold to me would not work under low pressure. \"We have acknowledged this mistake and have agreed to the return of the tap and issue a full refund and as a gesture of goodwill we will refund the £75\" refit charge.\nI sent my letter accepting this refund by return in 2016 and have emailed copies to the office administrator when requested since.\nI have been calling customer services endlessly since November 2015 when I raised the problem and from April 2016 for instructions for return and refund of c£200.\nI have only ever been able to speak to an administrator and leave messages for the office manager who wrote the letter. Since April 2016 the officer manager and her boss have always been out or in meetings!. I have also been copied into emails from the administrator to the office manager asking her to call me.\nNeither the office manager or her manager (whose email was passed to me by the administrator after a year) have ever come back to me.\nI have been advised Porcelanosa are in fact in breach of contract but still no resolve. The showroom, a separate arm of the company and who can not help in this matter, have though tried to contact the office manager on my behalf as a measure of goodwill, copying me in. Still no joy even when other company staff ask.\nReading other review sites I am sadly one of many customers receiving such dreadful customer service and being left out of pocket by this company and this office manager who is actually named in other reviews. This is certainly not the customer experience I expected from Porcelanosa or would want other people to experience.\nMy next step is to explore legal action. I feel though as the sum for Porcelanosa is minuscule they bank on customers not pursuing such claims. In contrast my bathroom refit was carried out by a local company who have been brilliant even going the extra mile with a brand supplier to exchange a part that failed just out of warranty.\nPlease, before deciding to entrust your hard earned money to Porcelanosa, explore all the review sites out there they feature on.

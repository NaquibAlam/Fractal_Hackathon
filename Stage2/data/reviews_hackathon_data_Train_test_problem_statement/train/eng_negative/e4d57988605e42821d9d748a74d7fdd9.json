I was given an approval code to bring it in for repairs which I did on 12/6/16. It's now 2/7/17 and my love seat has been lost. Home Zone is supposed to be delivering a new one on 2/7/17 to replace what they lost and they told me I would receive a call on 2/6/17 to be given a timeframe for the delivery. It's 5:28am and I have no heard from Home Zone and I have to go to work. I have no idea if my replacement love seat will be delivered to day or what time. Me and my husband have purchased many items from Home Zone and before this we were looking to get new furniture for our 2nd living room but now we are having 2nd thoughts. I'm disappointed and frustrated with the company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:42:04.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

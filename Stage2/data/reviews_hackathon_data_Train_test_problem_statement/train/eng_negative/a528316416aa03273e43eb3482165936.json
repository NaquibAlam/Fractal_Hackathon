Paid deposit and remaining balance was to be paid on car pick up. Got email to say car ordered wasn't available and I was quite happy to accept car that was offered even though it cost more. When I picked car up, not only was it not the car that was confirmed but alsoVIP CARS had failed to to inform the rental company that included in the price was an additional driver and a sat Nav. I had to pay the agreed price to rental company but they didn't have the sat Nav and extra driver was more too.\nWhen I informed VIP CARS of this, they told me that the extras were not included in the balance when clearly they were as I sent them the proof from their own website and my confirmation. Although I got a car, I paid for extra that I didn't receive and VIP CARS refused to admit fault on lack of communication with rental company and refused to return my money for the extras paid for.\nThey are a dishonest and disloyal company, I will never use them again or recommend them. Also was told by rental company that it's not the first time they have done this to someone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T10:28:41.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I received the parcel it was in a very cheap and poor packaging like the packages you would normally get from ebay. When i opened the packagef i noticed so mang white marks on the top which was absolutely frustrating so i contacted ssense and they offered a refund but i had previous bad experiences with returning stuff to overseas and never got the refund because the packaged got lost so i said to ssense that i'm not paying for any return shipping and i can't return the item. So the advisor offered me just Â£20 refund which was ridiculous for something that i cant even wear anymore because i tried so many ways to remove the stains and white patches but it doesnt go away. Im extremely unhappy with the experience and won't shop from there anymore and dont even recommend ssense to anyone", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:54:00.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

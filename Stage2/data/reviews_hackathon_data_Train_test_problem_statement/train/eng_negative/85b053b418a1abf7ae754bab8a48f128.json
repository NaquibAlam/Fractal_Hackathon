Sent 2 cards in for payment and a week and a half later I received an email stating they were received and payment was posted to my PayPal account. Great, thanks. However, when I checked my PayPal account there was no balance, no activity from CK. Contacted customer service twice asking to verify the PayPal email address they used because I never actually received payment. I have not heard back from them either time. Working on my next step to get my money or cards back, with absolutely NO assistance from Card Kangaroo. I should have known better, lesson learned. DO NOT TRUST THIS SITE.\n***UPDATE**It took 2 emails and a bad review to get someone to respond to my question--excellent customer service. I will note, however, that the phone call DID answer my question and I was finally able to work out the problem with PayPal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T13:51:28.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We suffered from a very bad hail storm that caused damage to our roof downspouts, skylite, window trim etc. An adjuster was sent and we were referred to a case worker for repairs. She was unavailable most of the time! Messages were left and not returned for several weeks! Our contractor communicated with her trying to resolve the claim, he too had trouble with communication. The house was repaired and later that year I received a letter saying that our coverage was in question and that we could be cancelled. Twenty months later (02/17/2017) I receive another letter saying that CC has concerns about the claim and that I should take appropriate measures to prevent additional losses! I'm not sure what I can do to prevent hail storms!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:09:40.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

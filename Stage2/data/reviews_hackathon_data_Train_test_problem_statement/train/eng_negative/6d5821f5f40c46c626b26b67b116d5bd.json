I could have sold this ticket on an alternative site or to a friend however could not complete those transactions due to the commitment to Ticketmaster resale. Tried to find out more info so I could be released from Ticketmaster resale in a reasonable timeframe to allow an alternative sale but Ticketmaster resale did not allow this, which cost me money, about $200.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:12:12.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

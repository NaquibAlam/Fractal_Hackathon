I had no choice but to pay the money out of my own pocket without any evidence that it had even been sent in the first place. Also, avoid this insurance company if you live in a rural area. The GPS tracking that monitors your driving habits does not work properly in the country ( I never had an issue when I lived in the city) as the roads are notorious for wildly varying speed limits. Therefore it is almost impossible to remain within the threshold and you just end up with a text every Friday telling you that you're a maniac and to drive carefully. To top it off my policy was cancelled out of the blue 2 weeks before the renewal with no refund and the only explanation was that the Underwriters policy had changed and that they couldn't comment further. I am squeaky clean with my drivers record so I couldn't understand why it was cancelled. When I asked for more info I was told rudely (again) that it was not Boxymo's policy to discuss matters with their Underwriters and that I still wasn't due any form of refund. I then asked for my no claims bonus to be sent to me in the post - it was never received and i'll hazard a guess that I will need to pay 30 euros for another phantom claims certificate. Along with Vodafone this has to be the worst company I have ever had to deal with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T23:29:24.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was very surprised to hear this so I advised the rep. I never received the package nor tracking info and my community has package holding so if it was left by usps (as the rep said sometimes happens) I would've been notified via email and phone by my property. The rep apologized and said I needed to verify 1 more time there's no package near/in mailbox or at office and complete the req. forms to have them send a replacement unit if necessary. I took addtnl measures to even go to post office w/ info rep provided to try and find my package but was told they show it as drop off and no other info available. I submitted the forms as instructed and faxed them in per instructions. Waited another wk (like the vapor rep advised) and still nothing so I called back in 02/10 & was told my fax wasn't received and was asked to send forms via email to rep. Omar personally. I emailed the completed forms and the fax confirmation to Omar who confirmed receipt via email. Another 10 days go by... Still nothing as of 02/20/17. So I called Omar direct # provided in email and left vm. I then called the regular cx service # I was used to and surprise Omar answers, I told him I still haven't received anything and he said it hasn't been sent yet but everything was sorted w/ the other Dept. He ended the call by saying he would sent my package today 02/20 and give it another wk. I am shocked that after a month and constant communication from me there's still to date nothing in transit to me. My very first purchase w/ vapor nation and HUGELY disappointed! I haven't quite fig. Out if this is a scam or just bad business. The reps I spoke to were nice but my purchase was for a product not their time to talk to me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T19:14:27.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

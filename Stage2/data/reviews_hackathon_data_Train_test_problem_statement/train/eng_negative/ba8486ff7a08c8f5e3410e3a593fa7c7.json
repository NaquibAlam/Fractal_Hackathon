Next day I wanted to see it again and to my surprise it wasn't there anymore and my order was gone. I forgot to write down the order #.\nI found the film at Blu Ray.com where it costed the above mentioned price and I see they have raised it to $ 17.99 today with no improvement.\nThere site on Google is not the same as when ITunes is opened, all mixed up. I learned that I have to write at Google, the name of the film + itunes, click at the film + click what resolution you want then click at the shop and you are there.\nSo all in all it wasn't a good experience at all and it is the last time I will use it and just wave goodbye to my money.\nIs that the standard APPLE has at their other products that will not make me a fan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:11:14.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

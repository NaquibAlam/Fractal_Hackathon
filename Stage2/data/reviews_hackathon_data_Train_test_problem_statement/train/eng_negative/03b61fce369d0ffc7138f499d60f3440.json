I selected a bouquet to send to a friend for her birthday because something came up and I was unable to attend the celebration. I placed the order and received confirmation email at 1:00pm on a Tuesday confirming the delivery would arrive to her by the end of the day. JUST WAIT...\nI receive a call by a rep at 5:15pm saying they were unable to deliver the order that day because the florist already delivered to that area. Okay? Couldn't have let me know sooner? Anyways, she promised and guaranteed the order would be delivered the following day (Wednesday) and I convinced her to give me 30% off the deal.\nWell, here we are on Wednesday and I just got an email notification stating they were unable to deliver my order today because none of the florists had the arrangement (it was a basic $25 bouquet, not hard to come up with something), and they could get it out tomorrow, Thursday. The rep I spoke to said the rep yesterday must have been lazy in updating her notes and it's an issue they have within the company. OKAY?! Sorry, don't care, I'll take my happy a** to the store and buy her flowers and deliver myself at this point.\nBottom line: they advertise same day delivery, call you at the very last minute at end of day to break the news that they can't get the order out so you can't cancel and order with someone else, charge an absurd service and delivery fee, and don't even provide what they charge for!\nTo the company execs: you should spend more time and money focusing on your servicing department rather on your advertisements and google search engine optimization. What's the point in attracting more people to the business when it's run so poorly? FYI: if you are 3 days late on a same day delivery order, cover the costs yourselves and offer to do it for free.\nMOVE ALONG, PEOPLE.

Yesterday I realised that my name was the wrong way around so my first name 'Maria' was listed as my last name and vice versa. I just found out that Qantas won't simply change the name around but they have a rule that the ticket must be purchased again.\nAny person with common sense would see this as a common mistake that could be made so easily by anyone and evidently it is very clear that Maria is my first name. But no, Qantas wants me to purchase another ticket for roughly $3500, which is totally outrageous.\nTo save yourself such shocking customer care if some tiny error is made please do not book with this airline! They show absolutely no good will to customers but instead require exorbitant amounts for tiny mistakes that could be rectified without much effort on their part - just using common sense.\nI will now look to any other airline that values their customers compared to the service and care I have received from Qantas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T13:06:53.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I got the shipement and installed it, I realized a few things wrong with the touchscreen. The colors were weird and purple along with the screen cracked a little on the bottom. This happens and I am not disappointed there, my disappointed comes when I send multiple emails asking for some customer support. I written those emails and describing my problem with no reply which by far is very disrespectful being that I spend over 300 dollars with TomTop. I am still patiently waiting for a reply that will probably never come.

My first experience on the website was good so I felt confortable to do a second order. I bought a mobile phone on the website and I paid for the International Express Delivery - 24 to 48 hours. Guess what? The delivery took more than a week. Besides that, I noticed that I payed almost more 3 euros for the postage that the site announces. I contacted the Customer Service and they told me they could refund me of the difference (but then forgot it...) and didn't say anything about the fact that I payed for a Express Delivery and it has been a week and nothing. I contact them again and I receive an answer with an atitude \"oh well, it's normal\" I paid extra for a service, I don't received what they promise and this is the kind of reply? NEVER AGAIN, thanks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:51:29.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

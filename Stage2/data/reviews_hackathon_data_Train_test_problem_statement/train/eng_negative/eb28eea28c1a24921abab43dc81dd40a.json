When I finally got ahold of the guy, he said that I needed 90 days as a seller to qualify. Uh hello, I've been selling for 4 years! If your gonna supposedly do a review of my account and lie at least know what your talking about. Very small company with nothing but excuses. Their best one is that they're a new company...lol. If you look into it or start asking a lot of questions, they'll start ignoring you. They have some very shady business practices that should be reported to the authorities. The fees are not worth it and there's a lot that this company does not tell you. Do your homework on them and weigh other options before you use these guys. Website is very vague and doesn't tell you anything. Red flag company to me. You really don't need them if you run your business right. Heck, read these other bad reviews.. they can't even manage your money right. They'll rob you if you don't pay attention. They're just after your hard earned money...you've been warned! As you can see.. Now they reply to me below because I left them an honest review of my experience. They did not notify me immediately about anything. I had to call myself! The response below is a complete lie and that should be all the proof you need about how shady this company is. I met all the requirements and I sell consistently everyday. Wow, what a joke these guys are! Keep lying and doing your customers wrong, it will only hurt you and your company in the end. I'll make sure to let everyone I know about these guys and I'll share this review everywhere possible if you reply with some crap again that isn't true.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T07:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:08:34.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I had to wait weeks for shipping which was awful because my son had broke his frames and NEEDED new ones very quickly. I bought from this company because they were alot cheaper than the same frames at the eye doctor, by I would have paid the higher price had I known shipping came from outside of the USA, he could have had his replacement glasses weeks ago! Thank goodness his prescription is fairly low so he can function somewhat without his glasses. If that would have been for me though, I would have been bed ridden for weeks since I can't see a thing without my glasses. It would have cost me weeks off work. I will not be recommending this company to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:08:48.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

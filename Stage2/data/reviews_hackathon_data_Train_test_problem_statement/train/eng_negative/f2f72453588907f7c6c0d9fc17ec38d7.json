Mine was not but I still had to pay the extra £30.\nI ponied up as I didn't want to wait the O2 predicted wait of 15-30 days. Turns out that O2 unlocked my phone after only 3 days. The unlock provided by this company came through a full 5 days after that.\nMy advice - do it through your phone provider if you can, be patient and save yourself the £50 that this option WILL cost you if you choose to use it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:29:11.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was given a location & was Quote: d $15 setup fee plus no need for insurance & no contract needed. Well when we got there, it WASN'T a 24- hour access location, the fee of $15 was only for 4 days, we did need insurance and had to sign a contract. Now how can the information given to me be so INCORRECT?! Do these companies not talk to each other as to what they are offering? The good thing was that since we were told it was a 24-hour access the agent provided us with that. We ended having to pay a prorated rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:33:17.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

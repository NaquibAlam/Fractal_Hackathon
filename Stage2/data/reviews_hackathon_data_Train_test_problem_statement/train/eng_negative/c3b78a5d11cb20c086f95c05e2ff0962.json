The homeowner, my 95/96 year old uncle and I have had a disappointing experience with AAG. Amanda Derse was disrespectful (I still have one of her downright nasty emails) and seemed to drag her feet about completing this loan. We were told by Jennifer Feliciano that we could have the repair work done after the loan money came through. Jennifer seemed delightful and my uncle was impressed with her. Amanda said that the repair work needed to be done up front and my uncle was only given the name of one contractor who charged over $60,000 for interior painting, a new roof and a small amount of attic insulation. I sent a mildly complaining email to Jennifer's boss (I think his name is Michael O'Connor) about Amanda. He should have responded to me that he would take care of the problem. Instead he forwarded the email to Amanda and the issues with her then began! The loan was miscalculated and had to be resigned by my uncle a few days after the original signing in Feb.. i realize that dealing with my uncle's caregiver can be difficult but I can handle him and could be brought into any problems right away. I will never recommend AAG to anyone and when I see Tom Seleck on television I immediately mute and look away!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T13:07:31.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

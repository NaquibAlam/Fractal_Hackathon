I got a purchase confirmation for a travel policy on my flight booking. I had to call Manulife who transferred me to flight hub. They told be the would refund the payment. I checked my credit card statement after a number of days. There was no refund. I called flight hub again and they told me the cancellation was declined. They never contacted me to tell me it was declined. I had to call back to ask for a cancellation again. They told me they would cancel again within 2 to 10 business days. I spend 1.5 hours on the phone to try to get a charge cancelled that was never requested, asked to be cancelled, and I'm still not certain Ill get my money back. I can't recommend booking with this company. Paul the supervisor (employee # 2016) was very polite but he was adamant the company could not process the refund within 1 hour as described in the formal company response to this known issue with the firm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:41:46.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

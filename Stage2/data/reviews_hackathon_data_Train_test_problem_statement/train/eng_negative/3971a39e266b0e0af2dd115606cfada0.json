There has to be about only 5 people working here! I booked a flight for 3+ people and was guided by one of the reps to cancel my existing flight through another agency because he could give me a better deal. Of course, me wanting to save money I went ahead and canceled my flight through the other agency to reserve 5 seats through this one. When I tell you it has been nothing but HELL dealing with these people who barely speak any English! I was fortunate enough to at least receive 3 of my tickets which by the way to 7+ hours just to receive a confirmation and am still waiting for my last few tickets. To avoid the hassle stay FAR AWAY FROM THIS AGENCY! Not fraud, but definitely not professional or organized enough to help book party of more than ONE!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:00:36.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

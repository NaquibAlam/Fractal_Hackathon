I should’ve known to check reviews before purchasing an item on getButterfly codecanyon and Envato Market, but I let my guard down, and bang. I never got the download I paid for, and worse, it sends me a link, which leads to an “can’t find server” page. I attempt to contact them, and there’s not a chat or phone customer service line, just a shallow reply that the matter is being looked into. Today I go back to site, and there’s not even a record that I’m a client or record of my purchase. Yes, it’s a small loss, but not worth losing valuable time. The money is chump change, however, the experience is invaluable, especially after reading the comments here. I am at the least thankful that I can put this ugly episode behind me and move on. People like this are petty and unethical. Anyone considering doing business with Envato Market, I simply say…BUYER BEWARE!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:27:33.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I pointed out the absurdity of this and the suggestion to log off was repeated by the rep. I logged off while I was on the phone and logged back in and the price was still $549 with taxes and fees included. He told me I was wrong and finally offered to cancel the transaction for a fee. I refused to pay the fee and eventually he said he would cancel it free of charge. However I still see the charge for the fees and taxes on my credit card. I eventually booked through the airline itself for a much cheaper rate including the taxes and fees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T16:31:14.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

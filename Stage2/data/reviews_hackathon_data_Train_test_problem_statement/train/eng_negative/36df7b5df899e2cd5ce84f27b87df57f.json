I explained I would not have booked the room unless it was refundable (because of the nature of the trip). The ladies I spoke to became increasingly harder to understand as they became more agitated and rude while I was trying to calmly explain my situation. I was then told to send a screen shot (which I had) that clearly showed the booking was refundable. After sending it to customer service and calling to verify they received the screen shot, I was told an investigation would be opened and I would receive a response within 2 days. A week has passed and still no word.\nEven after the fact when I sent over the proof and there is no response --This is completely unacceptable.\nThe worst customer service ever. Never booking through AMOMA again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:27:53.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

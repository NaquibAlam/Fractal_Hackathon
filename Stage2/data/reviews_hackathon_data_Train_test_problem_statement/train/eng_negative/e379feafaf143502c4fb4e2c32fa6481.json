Instead cancelled the complete reservation and had to make a new one to get charged again. At least after much discussion the waived the cancellation fee. I was on the phone for 1:30 minutes. Also, they charged $30 for pre-seat collection automatically without even giving the seat numbers....Very disappointing booking experience.

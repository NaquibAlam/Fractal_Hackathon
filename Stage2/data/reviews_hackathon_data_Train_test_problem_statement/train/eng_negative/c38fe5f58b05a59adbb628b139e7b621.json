He said he didn't know of any. Well after 10 mins giving him all my info he says there's an $80 installation fee. I said there's no reason. I have my own modem and the house is already wired for it. He then put me on hold for 10 mins and came back with another person on the line saying there wouldn't be a installation fee but I had to wait until Wednesday, it was Friday, to get my service turned on. Well that's ridiculous in and of it self but then somehow my order was canceled. I contacted the service provider to double check the connection date on Tuesday and I didn't have one. The service provider rep not only put the order back in but it was on in a couple of hours without anyone coming out or installation fee. In My Area wasted 5 days of me not having internet and in turn costed the service provider money. On top of that once the order is placed In My Area can't help at all. I will never use and will warn others not to use In My Area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T13:06:30.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My hotel accommodations in Quito (Hotel Patio Andaluz) and Guayaquil (Oro Verde) were excellent. The ship on which I spent 7 nights, the Galapagos Legend, was wonderful; a comfortable cabin, excellent food, a great crew and very knowledgeable guides. My experience with Goway was positive from the start and the Senior Sales travel specialist who assisted me, Michael Rigillo was excellent. I will use Goway again in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T11:48:28.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

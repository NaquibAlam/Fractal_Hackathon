Our adventure to Iguazu Falls after a South American /Antarctica cruise was everything we could hope for. We wondered if our transfers to and from the airports etc. would be there when we started but after the first day we 'knew' they would be. David set up a private guide at Iguazu that made the experience unforgettable and much better than if we had toured ourselves. Highly recommend Goway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:15:22.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

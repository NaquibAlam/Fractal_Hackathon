Made a big purchase. My first \"fancy\" camera. Before I have always owned a small camera, one that I can slip into my pocket. I bought one with lens and accessories. my order arrived when promised and quickly.It was packaged safely so nothing was damaged. I was able to track it all the way from start to finish. Then to my surprise I also received a rewards card. So I was able to get more toys for camera, that were on my wish list anyways at no additional cost. I will be back for more toys for my camera for sure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:58:26.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When it comes to my personal holidays and events, the last thing I want to do is more planning - it takes the relaxation and fun out of holidays for me. Sadly from my daily experiences I have exceptionally high standards and expectations - perhaps too much! Exceptional Villas have been the most amazing team from the enquiry stage, I have felt like one of my own clients and I have found them pro-active, supportive, reactive and super professional and courteous. Nothing is too much for them and I wouldn't book a holiday without them now.\nIn a few simple steps they have booked my villa, my groceries, my car rental, my VIP airport arrival and departure through customs, my airport transfers and even my friends ground travel who arrives mid-way. They sent through proposals for restaurants and tours and ultimately are there to ensure I have the best holiday.\nI am so relaxed before leaving this weekend and I cannot wait to get to Barbados.\nThanks you Julie & Yvonne.\nLex & Marc", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:56:47.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

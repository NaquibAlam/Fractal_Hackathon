This is a gorgeous country... very verdant.pastures, beautiful mountains, water everywhere and the best food ever!!! Paula Czarnik from Goaway travel was instrumental in making our trip such a wonderful success. Her knowledge of the country and its unique culture, enabled us to have a diverse experience, both with activities and relaxation. We particularly enjoyed the majesty of Milford Sound (we will do Doubtful Sound next time), the fabulous steamboat ride and lunch at Walter Peak sheep ranch outside Queenstown,, the Te Papa museum In Wellington, our mountain hike in Mt Maunganui, kayaking in the Coromandels, our afternoon bush to beach tour in Auckland and of course visiting Hobbiton!!! Paula was also able to squeeze in so much more (yeah... wine tasting) without making it exhausting, and is a real asset to anyone planning to trip to New Zealand.

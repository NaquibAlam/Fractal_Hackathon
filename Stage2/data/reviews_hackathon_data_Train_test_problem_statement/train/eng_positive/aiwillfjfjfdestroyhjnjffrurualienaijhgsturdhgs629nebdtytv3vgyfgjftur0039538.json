It was designed off plan, in the run up to a proposed kitchen extension. Charlotte was excellent to deal with, available by phone and email and responded more than promptly to any queries. She was able to assist with various design ideas and also highlighted other issues which arose with the kitchen plans. We are very pleased with her service. We have used Porcelanosa before for the purchase of bathroom tiles and have always found them excellent to deal with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T21:51:30.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

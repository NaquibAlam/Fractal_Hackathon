They have the most inexpensive trike that I could find that had a quality name to it. In the end I had called customer support twice with questions before I purchased the Rover and both time the person on the other end was wonderful. I made my purchase and got my trike even quicker that they stated----like 4 days and it was here. The trike is awesome but I did find out something future buyers should know. The aftermarket parts you can get a lot cheaper than from Terra Trike itself, so if you need flags or mirrors or bells check your local store first. I Love my rover!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:17:50.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

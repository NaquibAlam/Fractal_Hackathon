This time it was another personal order, but I've also ordered stamps for work and then got my office to order more for the rest of the staff. However, when I want a specialized stamp I never hesitate to come here. I usually have special stamps made for Where's George stamping and this latest one was one of those - but with a twist. I love how easy it is to design your own stamp on their website so you know what it will look like when you get it - and when it arrives, it's EXACTLY like the ones I designed. I ordered two special stamps this time and I'm sure I'll be back for more. Shop with Rubber Stamp Champ with confidence. I've never had a problem and it's easy and fun to use their website and they have a very quick turn around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:07:43.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

What could be better than travelling, going on adventures & looking after assorted fluffies. For pet owners what could be better than someone who loves looking after assorted fluffies taking care of your furry friend & someone who hopefully won't burn your house down as indicated by them not having burnt other peoples houses down. Let's face it animal's love staying in there homes, being in kennel's seem's to be a fairly traumatic experience for them, and even pet owner's deserve a holiday every now and then. There will also be times over the course of the year's when you need to take a trip & it isn't going practical to take your furry friend on however much you are joined at the hip. I think it is a great community which I am proud to be a part of, I look for to meeting many more furry soul's & there human families. I think Trusted Housesitters is inclusive & facilitates a good system as people can read reviews & profile's to get a zest of what someone is like when deciding who to select for a sit, housesitter's can even upload a video of themselves & they can get a good indication of pet families by reading there profile & looking at photos of the fur rainbows. Resulting in good matchs of fur bunnies and little nomad's.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:48:58.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

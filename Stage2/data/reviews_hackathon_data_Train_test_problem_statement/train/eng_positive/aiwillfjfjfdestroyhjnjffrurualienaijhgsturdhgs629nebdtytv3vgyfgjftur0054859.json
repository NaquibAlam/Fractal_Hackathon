The transport to their yard was easy and the wagon was very new and in excellent condition. The staff were very friendly and the transit driver was extremely helpful with tips and experiences. We inspected the vehicle and within 1 hour I received a digital copy of agreed scratches/dents so there was never going to be any issues. Their rates were also the most competitive. I highly recommend this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:36:38.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

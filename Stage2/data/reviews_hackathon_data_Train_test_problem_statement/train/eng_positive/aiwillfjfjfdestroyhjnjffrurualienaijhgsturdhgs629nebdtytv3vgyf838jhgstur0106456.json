The website is clean, modern, and easy to use. I was a little skeptical at first after reading other reviews and due to the price, and reading horror stories of people never receiving their e-tickets. I can safely say that the booking process was simple and I received my tickets within minutes of confirming my booking. I then validated the tickets through the individual airlines and they were all immediately viewable and correct.\nAll-in-all, considering the value and the fact that the website is nicely designed and easy to use, I would recommend. I don't think the tickets you are looking for not being available anymore warrants a negative review, so I would ignore those.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T17:29:55.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

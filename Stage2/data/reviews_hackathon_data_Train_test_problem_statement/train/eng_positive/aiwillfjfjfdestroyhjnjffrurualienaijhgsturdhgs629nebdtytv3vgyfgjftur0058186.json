After a leaving a review on a pair of sunglasses I bought a few months ago that I didnt like, the staff even contacted me and began a refund/exchange on them because I hated them and never wore them out once. Very happy with the service, cant wait for my new pair to come in the mail!\nGlasses at Firmoo are very nice and unique, I can always find at least one pair from their website that I like (that's hard because I'm picky). Their Buy 1 Get 1 sale that is always ongoing is awesome, and I usually find deals on trends that are in style now because of the newsletter I recieve, it's great.\nGlasses prescriptions are on point, they havent made a mistake yet and quite frankly, I dont think they will ever make a mistake unless I told them to do it.\nCons:\nI would like to see more flexibility on customization for orders. The manufacturer they work with only provide a limited amount of colors for lenses, I would be happy to see more colors like Yellow, Gold, or Orange, more colors in mirror, like Peach Pink mirror or Gold mirror, choices for gradient tints in all colors so you can have two colors in one lense, and more colors in polarized options not just green brown and black. Most importantly, I would like full control of the opacity of the tint, such as Pink tint at 45% opacity, sky blue at 65% opacity, or dark blue at 75% opacity.\nComments:\nI think it would be awesome if Firmoo got with a company that does prescriptions and could offer their customers a discount on renewing their prescriptions at the office in the customers hometown. (Im sure many of Firmoo's customers could use a new prescription)\nI also think it would be cool if Firmoo would take in frames the customer sent in and fill the prescription for them. So if I happened to find a vintage pair at a thrift store that I really like that i couldnt find on their website, I could still get my prescription filled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T17:15:08.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

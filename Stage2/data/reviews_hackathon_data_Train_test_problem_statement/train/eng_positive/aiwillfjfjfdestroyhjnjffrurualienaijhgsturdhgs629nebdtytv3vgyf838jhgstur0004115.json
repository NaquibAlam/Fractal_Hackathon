Things only got better when I eMailed them some questions about a project and Bob Muckle worked with me over the course of a week to refine and custom design the panels for my project, sending multiple CAD drawings (with tolerance down to 1/32\"!). The panels arrived about a 10 days after ordering (had to ship from the east coast to California) and I was impressed, yet again, by the care in packaging. Each panel was in a cardboard box, encased in expanding foam so that the panel was fully protected. The panels themselves are exactly as shown in the CAD drawing and perfect. I'm SO glad I didn't try making them -- Wainscoting America should be everybody's go-to for wainscoting, trim, baseboard, etc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T04:14:19.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

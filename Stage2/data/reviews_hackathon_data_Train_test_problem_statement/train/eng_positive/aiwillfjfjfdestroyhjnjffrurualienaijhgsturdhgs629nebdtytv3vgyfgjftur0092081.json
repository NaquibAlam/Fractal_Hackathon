We already juggle a bunch of things to do daily and education seemed out of the question. I must say Trident was truly a blessing. I wasn't familiar with taking online classes but I needed to get my education to get to the next level. The beauty of doing classes this way is that you pretty much became the student, teacher, researcher, and master of many techniques. The professors were there to help, but this type of classroom environment caused me to think outside of the box to get things accomplished. I earned my BSHS December 2008. Thanks to Trident I was able to apply for the Army Officer Candidate School and get accepted. After school I became a 2nd Lieutenant in the Medical Service Corp. I was also able to get my MSHS January 2015. I have now retired from the Army as of 30 November 2016. Thank you Trident for setting me up for success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:39:16.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There is a sea of competitors on the index page when you google this product / service, so I had no specific guidance and just chose this brand. I have not received my boxes yet, but their press/production and shipping was very timely as was their response time to my messages. I will say that the representative I was in contact with (I won't mention his name) was not pleasant. He made me feel like a nuisance for contacting him (even over the website chat). Spending $1,500 I know I am a SMALL fish, but the intention was for this to be an ongoing quarterly order. After being made to feel like a nuisance I will reconsider my options. Had this person been even slightly more personable and behaved like a glad representative of the company, I would proceed with the utmost confidence (given that the product arrives and is of the quality I would expect...) This feedback is meant as constructive and I hope it helps their staff see the consumer side of the transaction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:28:26.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

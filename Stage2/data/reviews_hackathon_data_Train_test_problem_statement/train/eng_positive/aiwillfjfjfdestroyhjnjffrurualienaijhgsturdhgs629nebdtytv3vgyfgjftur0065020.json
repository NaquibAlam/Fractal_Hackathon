I had looked on line for the combination of custom frames with custom mats and it seemed a bit extravagant. So, I got a standard frame that was about the right size and planned to order custom mats instead. I wanted the mats to match some other items in a similar collection and the variety of colors and options available led to a great result. And I think I got the mats in about 4 days from the day I ordered! Amazingly fast! They look great! I'm very pleased!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T23:21:05.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

She listened to our needs and wants and structured the perfect vacation for our family. The locations, lodging and food were impeccable. Our drivers, tour guides and excursions at all locations were top notch. The Kiora Hotel with an amazing view of the Arenal Volcano was amazing....and its HOT SPRINGS too. LaFortuna was quaint and a joy to walk around the small town. The horseback ride and trek to the waterfall was breathtaking. The river excursion was filled with the true beauty of Costa Rica and animals galore. Tamarindo was awesome as well, with a Villa that was stunning and only a minute walk to the beach or a few to town. The local people were so friendly and fun, the beaches were gorgeous and we thoroughly enjoy our stay. We recently booked our second trip with Robin for this coming April and we are looking forward to taking our entire family of 5 to Costa Rica, this time our daughter is able to come with us.

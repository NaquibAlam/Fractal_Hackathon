Tackle Direct has an EXPANSIVE selection of tackle, in my opinion, it's their greatest asset. If I can't find something elsewhere, I can usually count on Tackle Direct. However, the \"discounts\" and \"points\" aren't very lucrative, so I'm generally shopping at Tackle Direct after first looking for an item on a site that has better prices (whether through better \"promo codes\" or always sub-retail pricing). I also love the videos, brings me to the site more often and if all things are equal - I'm more likely to purchase through Tackle Direct. The website could be easier to navigate, especially for comparison shoppers (TackleWarehouse's site comes to mind). Very good company, always room for improvement. Lastly, as a fisherman my whole life, growing up in Florida; love the addition of BlacktipH, makes the company feel less \"Northeastern\" and more a global fishing retailer (or, I'm just a sucker for beach/shark fishing too!).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T08:01:10.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

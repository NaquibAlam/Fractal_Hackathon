Thanks to Kate at Rickshaw the travel arrangements, accommodation, tours, drivers and guides were all excellent. Everything went very smoothly. If you haven't been to Laos, then do not hesitate in going. It is a beautiful country with very welcoming people. We visited Luang Prabang alongside the Mekhong River and stayed at Sala Prabang along the river-highly recommend. Luang Prabang is a place of temples, good food, Botanic Garden, easy to walk around and visit the countryside to the Bear Sanctuary and Kuang Si Falls. Next we went to Bolaven Plateau, southern Laos and stayed at the Tad Fane Resort in the forest with beautiful butterflies, amazing waterfalls and walks through the coffee plantations and on the plateau. Then on to Four Thousand Islands and stayed on Don Khone with brilliant sunsets on the Mekhong River, very peaceful, and recommend cycling through the rice fields. Highlight in Thailand was our visit to Khao Yai National Park. We went there by train from Bangkok which was lots of fun and stayed at the Khao Yai Life Nature Resort, located in the countryside and a very enjoyable stay. We went to see the bats leave the caves as dusk and next day went to Khao Yai National Park. We did see gibbons, hornbills, macaques, sambar deer and one wild elephant. It is a large park with many visitors, so be realistic about how much wildlife you expect to see. The walk through the forest and grasslands and visit to one of the waterfalls was very enjoyable in itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:52:45.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

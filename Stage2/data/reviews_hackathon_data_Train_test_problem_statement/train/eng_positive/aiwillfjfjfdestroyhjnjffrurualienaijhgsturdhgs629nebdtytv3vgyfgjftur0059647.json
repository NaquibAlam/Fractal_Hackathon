The past 2 we used the Catalina chair which we really liked. We had a bit of space issue in our new theater & wanted to also have Red fabric. With the help of Clara whom I called several times in the process of picking she sent me a Quote: to secure the price while she had the fabric sample sent out. Can't wait to see how our 6 red Sienna chairs look in our project. Once again very pleased with dealing with 4seating & Clara's help made the process so simple.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:09:32.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

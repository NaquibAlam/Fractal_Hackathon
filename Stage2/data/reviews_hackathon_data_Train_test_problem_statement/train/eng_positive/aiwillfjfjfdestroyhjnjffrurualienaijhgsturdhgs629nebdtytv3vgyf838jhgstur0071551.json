Also the roads almost gave me a heart attack! The drive way is weird so when you pull in you have to back out onto the road into the other drive way to back out and leave. Unless you have a jacked up 4x4! The cabin is close to pigeon Forge so that's a bonus! The cabin itself was very peaceful and a small but pretty view! I LOVE that they left popcorn and other goodies when we got to the cabin! Kinda like a warm welcome gift. The downstairs bed was very comfy but the upstairs bed wasn't. I'm glad we didn't bring my mother In law because she can't go up or down stairs and wouldn't have been able to sleep in a room considering both beds were up and down stairs. And it sounds crazy but weird stuff would happen like the rocking chair would just start rocking or the front door would wiggle and then open on its own. Other then that the cabin was very clean and peaceful. I would recommend you to stay if you have a jacked up 4x4, can walk up and down stairs, and don't care about the cabin being around other cabins!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:16:52.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

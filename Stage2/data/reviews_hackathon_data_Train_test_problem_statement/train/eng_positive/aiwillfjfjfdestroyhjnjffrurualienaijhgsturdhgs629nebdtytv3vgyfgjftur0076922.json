She is extremely athletic and fitness oriented (former collegiate swimmer) and quite outdoorsy (grew up on a farm, was an undergrad animal science major).\nI've been travelling internationally my entire life (literally) and never felt the need to use a travel service.\nI consulted Costa Rican Vacations based on the recommendation of a friend. One of the best decisions I've made!\nAaron planned a customized trip that was simply amazing.\nHiking, rappelling, waterfall jumping, thermal springs (and river!), zip-lining and the butterfly reserve in Arenal/La Fortuna.\nHorseback riding through the mountains of a coffee plantation and white water rafting (26 miles!) in Turrialba.\nA (sold out!) Costa Rican national team soccer match in San Jose.\nStunningly beautiful beach sunsets, mangrove swamp tours (crocodiles!), more zip lining, and, of course, Surfing Lessons(!) in Tamarindo.\nThe entire trip was one outstanding experience after another. Costa Rican Vacations (Aaron!) gave us access to places and experiences that are only available to someone who truly knows and understands the country. We felt like we were travelling the country with an old friend, It really was that good...\nI truly cannot thank Aaron and Costa Rican Vacations enough. Trip of a lifetime...\nUntil we come back!! :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:28:11.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

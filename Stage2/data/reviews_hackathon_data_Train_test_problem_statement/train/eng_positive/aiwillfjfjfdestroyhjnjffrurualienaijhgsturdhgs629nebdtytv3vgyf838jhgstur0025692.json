That's why I consume apricot kernels every day. And the best place to get them is from Apricot Power! Since they are bitter tasting, I simply grind them into a powder and mix it into some applesauce and it's more palatable. Eating apricot kernels every morning, combined with Juice Plus+ (I know in my heart) was the #1 reason I was able to say NO to CHEMO when I got diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer 2 years ago. The healing power in apricot kernels is superior to almost anything in nature. Apricot Power has the best kernels around in my humble opinion. Food is healthcare, medicine is sick care.

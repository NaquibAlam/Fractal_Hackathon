They listened to the idea I wanted to create and came back with some interpretations. They were patient and listened to me as we went from one revision to the other until I was satisfied with the final designs. They were flexible and were willing to ensure that I got what I wanted instead of forcing them something on me. From the moment contact was established until the order was delivered, customer service was fantastic. They threw some freebies for me as my order was not your conventional type. I have enjoyed talking on the phone with them and chatting online to get the work done according to my my needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:04:14.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

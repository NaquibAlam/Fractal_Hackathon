One of the dresses I ordered is on back order further than what was first communicated and they made sure I was aware of it. They called me twice (Didn't pick up because I wasn't familiar with the number), left me two messages (Was quarter-end at work and didn't have time to listen), and even emailed me. Since my event is just around the corner, they'll expedite the shipping to next day for me so that I can get the dress before I fly out to my event without any hesitation. Great customer service, definitely going to shop here again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:45:13.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

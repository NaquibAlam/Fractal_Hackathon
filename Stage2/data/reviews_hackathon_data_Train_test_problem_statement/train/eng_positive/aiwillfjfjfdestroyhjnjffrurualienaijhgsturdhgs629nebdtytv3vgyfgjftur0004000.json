I don't think I've ever looked for anything they didn't have available. The \"narrow results\" options are always appropriate and helpful for the search being done - much better than most of my other online shopping experiences. The specs section typically lets me find the technical information I'm looking for faster than going to the manufacturer's website. Prices are always competitive. The only reason I don't do all my shopping here is that when the exchange rate and import duty are factored in, it often ends up less expensive to buy locally in Canada.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:08:07.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

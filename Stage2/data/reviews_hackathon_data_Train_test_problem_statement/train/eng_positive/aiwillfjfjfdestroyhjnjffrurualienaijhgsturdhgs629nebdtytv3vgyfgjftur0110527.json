And after FedEx evidently left it on someone else's doorstep, it took a little arguing with all parties involved. Though no fault of mine, and no fault of Willis Orchards, it seemed like the real guilty party was trying to blame anyone but themselves. Anyway, the folks at Willis Orchards finally were able to make it possible for UPS to put a tree on my front porch. I planted it immediately and it took off growing like crazy. It now has tons of leaves and even fruit!! I couldn't be more pleased. I'm plannin' on havin' mayhaw jelly next Christmas.

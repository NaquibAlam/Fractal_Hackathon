Jorge Gomez has been my representative the entire time. There has not been a time that Jorge did not provide exceptional customer service. He always goes over and beyond to get me what I need promptly with follow-ups in between. I can be so needy and forgetful sometimes, but he never make me feel bad about it. I can just be myself. I appreciate him so much, and it's been a blessing to have him as I grow my real estate portfolio!\nLatoya", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:26:22.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Our usual dvd duplication company went out of business without advising us, which left us not knowing where to go -- so I researched online and found WTS! Our assigned customer service rep was helpful and quick to take on our project with providing the necessary components of our audio book. Within no time at all, we had a finished product that was even better than previously! I would highly recommend WTS for your dvd, audio book needs!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:56:36.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

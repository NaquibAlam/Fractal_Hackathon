I ordered mine after purchasing a set of hair extensions from Cashmere hair and was extremely disappointed. I ordered the 160g 20\" ash blonde and I am so happy with the quality and cost of my new extensions. The color was a little warm for me but that was no problem at all, a quick rinse with purple shampoo helped match them flawlessly to my hair! I have worn them a dozen times now and haven't had an issue yet with shedding. Shipping was fast and customer service is excellent. The previous extensions I purchased from Cashmere hair were the completely wrong shade, even after I purchased a swatch to make sure it was the right match, and were shedding as soon as they came out of the package. The biggest downfall was I paid a lot more for my previous extensions! I have purchased extensions from many different companies and I am now a Luxy Hair lifer. If you are looking for beautiful quality extensions that are reasonably priced buy Luxy Hair you will NOT be disappointed!! :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:16:28.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

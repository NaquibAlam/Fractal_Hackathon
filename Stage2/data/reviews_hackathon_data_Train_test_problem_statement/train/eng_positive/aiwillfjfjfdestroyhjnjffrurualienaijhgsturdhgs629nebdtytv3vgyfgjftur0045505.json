So I emailed them and they kindly told me to let them know when I was going to order a free pair so they could extend it. Bam. Great customer service. Second, I ordered two pairs of glasses (but 1 get 1 free) but they ended up being small on my face, so I emailed them so I could return them and order new ones. They emailed me back saying to keep my current pairs as back up and gave me a $30 voucher code for a new pair. They're the best, they're kind and generous.

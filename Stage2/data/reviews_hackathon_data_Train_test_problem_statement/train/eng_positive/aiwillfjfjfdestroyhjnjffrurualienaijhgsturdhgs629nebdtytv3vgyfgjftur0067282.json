As a collector of movie and television show signed artwork - photos, posters etc., I recently ordered two frames and mats for pieces I received as Christmas presents. I was able to highly customize both mats from a large selection of color and texture etc. Choice of frames is also extensive.\nI've previously used framers at my local craft store but wasn't happy having to leave my pieces at the store, and pay extra for a mat to be customized to often awkward sized photos etc. I was also paying a fortune to have simple pieces put together. Matboard & More have outstanding prices and amazing value for excellent quality. My order was processed and delivered quickly, and was exactly what I ordered when it arrived. My new photos look awesome and I'm already spying a new addition! I will be returning to Matboard & More to mat and frame it. Have no doubt - these guys are the best!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T23:26:04.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

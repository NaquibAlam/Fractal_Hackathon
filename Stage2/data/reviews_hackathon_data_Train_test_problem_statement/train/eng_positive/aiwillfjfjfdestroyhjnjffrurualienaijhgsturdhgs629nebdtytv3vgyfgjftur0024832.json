I was able to track my purchase with updates provided, and it arrived within days. It was folded to pocket-size, but ironed out beautifully, and has remained wrinkle-free while it blows and waves every day since it arrived. I am definitely purchasing a new American flag for our upcoming patriotic holidays. Our previous one has been properly retired, and we were looking for an economical replacement. Prices are VERY competitive here! I am a happy customer!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T03:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T19:02:20.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

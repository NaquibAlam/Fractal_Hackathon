Frames were late because they were back-ordered, but the gals at Frames Direct kept me in weekly email contact about it. They are Calvin Kleins, cat eyes and make me look like a million bucks.\nThey even let me use a somewhat dated Rx 'cause I just didn't feel like shelling out for an eye exam (about $60 or 80- not covered by my insurance). All I had to do was sign a release. Since using my intuition about this I've learned a lot of people's eyes don't change much after age 45 and so it is perfectly ok to get your eyes examined for an Rx every few years or so. Thanks Frames Direct. PS FD seemed to have the best selection, prices and reviews on the internet so I went with them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T23:19:09.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

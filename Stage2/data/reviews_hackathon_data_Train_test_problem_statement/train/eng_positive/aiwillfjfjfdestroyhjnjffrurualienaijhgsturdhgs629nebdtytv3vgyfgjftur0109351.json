There were extra charges for administration that were not advertised or stated until I was in the process of signing up - Administrative charges that surprised me are part of every storeroom cost and SHOULD be advertised as such. Very upsetting!! The next time I will be wiser with my questions and much more unforgiving. The approach was absolutely unethical, as is popping the \"insurance requirement\" when you are signing up. My inclination at the time was to walk away. I assure you that these approaches will not help you in my future decisions nor will it help you in word of mouth advertising.\n2. The lock requirement was weird because I think I should be able to use my own lock. I tried using my own standard lock but could not get it to fit so I had to buy one from StorageMart. This resulted in an $11.00 sale for StorageMart but huge mistrust for StorageMart going forward.\nThese two issues are fundamentally your two big issues and serious growth inhibitors, in my opinion. If you ignore these, cancel these surveys and just save your money an a review. Trying to identify or fix other issues is absolutely a waste of your profit dollars. The rest of the experience was absolutely fine, including the people that worked at the location.\nBy the way, I am checking your terms and conditions box because this feedback can only be accepted when I do, which is in itself absolutely ridiculous. My checkmark DOES NOT mean I accept the terms and conditions, it only means that I wanted to make certain you received my feedback. NOTE: This really makes it difficult for anyone to give you honest feedback (rather then just positive) and so I question whether you actually want real feedback. If you are interested, I will learn that based upon YOUR RESPONSE to this feedback.\nJeff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T18:02:03.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

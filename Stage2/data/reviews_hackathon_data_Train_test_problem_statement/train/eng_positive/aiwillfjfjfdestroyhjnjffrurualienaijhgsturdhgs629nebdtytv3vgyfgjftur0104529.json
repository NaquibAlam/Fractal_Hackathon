Then I discovered American Frame for under $100 I can order gorgeous frames, acrylic, mats, backing boards, all precut precisely to the sizes I need. It come in the mail in about 3 days. So now all I have to do is drop in the acrylic and mats, hang the art, staple in the backing board, then add the dust cover paper, hangers and bumpers. It actually looks better than the $300 work at the local framing shop, because, I think, it is better. My tip to readers is to order the mat sample kit, so you can select mat colors accurately at home with your art in hand. Selecting a frame is not as critical, I've found, as wood tones, blacks and golds are pretty much standard colors, and the 3D on-line model gives you a close look at the frame.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:42:58.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

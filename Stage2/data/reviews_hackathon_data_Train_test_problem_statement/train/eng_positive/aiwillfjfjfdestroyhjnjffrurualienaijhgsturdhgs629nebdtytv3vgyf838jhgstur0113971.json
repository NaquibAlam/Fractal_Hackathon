I used to use shopathome.com before as they used to have 110% guarantee. But after they stopped that, I switched to topcashback.\nI had an incident with topcashback when my $4500 transaction which was tickets to cruise (subject to 20% cashback) was not recorded somehow. I reported an issue and topcashback resolved the ticket and I got $900 cashback.

From the start. We have been treated very professionally. My biggest concern was \"Shame on you\" feeling for having to seek help for a long term debt issue. we were given support and not discipline. Phone calls with questions were handled quickly and completed on the phone.\nI have dealt with one other company, which was totally there for profit. After paying a large monthly fee, we struggled for a few years with wrong information and constant worry. After all this, we were told they were closing and we were on our own again.\nMy bank suggested TCA and that was a blessing. Now that our debt is paid up, we can start fresh with a brighter future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:23:29.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

However, I feel extremely satisfied with the final product and in general the experience was very satisfactory. Nick did a great job providing me with knowledgeable guide when choosing from the diamond database, in order to find the right diamond quality and value for my money. I must say that he did an excellent 24/7 follow up, and was helpful to accommodate my special requirements.The final product overcome my expectations! When I opened the box I was astonished by the sparkling and the shining of the diamonds. The quality of workmanship is outstanding!\nEven though I am satisfied with the product, I strongly believe there are some improving opportunities in the service. I live abroad, I needed to be sure that there was no future need to send the rings back for adjustments, therefore I requested some images of the product, so I could verify everything was in order before the shipping however I didn't received the images.\nAnother aspect that made feel dissapointed is the fact that I didnt received the appraisal report ´that most customers say in their review that comes in as standard. When I asked about it, I was told to send the rings back to B2C Jewels and to pay $50 which is not possible since I live abroad. B2C Jewels´ final recommendation was to get an appraisal from local jewelry in order to fulfill my insurance requirement. Anyways, I recommend B2C Jewels to offer this appraisal up front, Jewelry markets abroad do not work like in the USA, therefore and appraisal is extremely useful as a point of reference for your investment.\nWell, in general the experience was good,the product is an outstanding piece of jewelry. Definitely I would recommend B2C Jewels and will make business with them again. Just remind myself to ask for the appraisal report upfront!\nAN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T18:19:34.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

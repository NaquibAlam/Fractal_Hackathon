My telephone interaction wasn't as good as last time. The person I spoke with did not give me an adequate explanation as to why I could only access one flight (did not have multiple options) for my return trip and kept reiterating the same phrase (perhaps a language barrier?). It was frustrating so I indicated that I would think about it and call back. He told me that if I didn't book then and there that I could pay as much as DOUBLE for my trip. He repeated that statement. I told him I'd take my chances and said goodbye. I booked on-line a couple of days later with no problem. FlightHub offers great prices and I've used them several times in the past. I did ask friends who also book with them and a couple of them also had a bit of a dicey phone conversation. I have never a problem before so hopefully this was a one-of.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:16:11.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

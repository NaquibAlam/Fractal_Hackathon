We planted them according to instructions and they have thrived. He said they were the best young trees he's ever seen - and he's 87! I decided to plant my own peach trees this year and returned to Willis. i asked for a spring delivery and was surprised when I was notified that my trees would arrive on Feb 15. I called and asked them to wait until mid March and they agreed. But about 15 minutes later, they called back and said that \"the boss\" had recommended that I consider going ahead with the Feb 15 delivery due to the early (due to this very warm winter) budding of the trees. I agreed and my new trees are safely in the ground. I appreciate this level of service and I'm looking forward to great peaches in a few years!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:00:34.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

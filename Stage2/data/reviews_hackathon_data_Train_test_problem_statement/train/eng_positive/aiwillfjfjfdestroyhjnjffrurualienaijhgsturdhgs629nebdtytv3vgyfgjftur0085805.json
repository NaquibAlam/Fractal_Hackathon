They're honest about the conditions of books (if you bought a \"Good\" condition book, it will be good condition, and different from a book labelled \"Acceptable,\" etc.) and because of their massive secondhand collection, you can find all sorts of obscure goodies.\nPrices can't be beat--most books I've bought from Thrift were under $6, and all were under $20. Free shipping on orders over $25 is also awesome, but these low prices make it a very dangerous place for a bibliophile (be forewarned that a fair amount of your paycheque may henceforth be devoted to buying delightful used books, as is mine).\nI've never had any problems with shipping or customer service, all my books came on time, and the quality was always what I expected. Thrift Books is a fantastic resource with a vast selection, and I blame it entirely for the rapidly dwindling amount of space on my bookshelves. ;)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T21:05:23.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

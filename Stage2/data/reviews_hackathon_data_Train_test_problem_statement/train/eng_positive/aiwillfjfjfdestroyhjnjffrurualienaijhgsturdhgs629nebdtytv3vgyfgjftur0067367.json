I use about 8 a day, and since few days after starting I have not smoked. I tried to quit for years, and after a trip to the lung surgery in the hospital I realized it was time to get serious. I no longer smoke, and when I feel urge to do so i pop in a siberia and boom-bam - the urge is gone like a fog on a morning breeze\nI mainly use snusline to get my product, as it is the cheapest one I could find. I place an order, and 10 to 14 days later I have it in my mailbox under the building. four cans for about 15 dollars. I used the site now 10-14 times, and it is like this every freaking time. one time they got the parcel back (our postman here is not so reliable) and they mailed me imediately upon getting it, and said they reshipped and it would be with me soon. .. this happened very fast. I think they mailed it express at their expense.\nvery pleased and happy customer here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:38:52.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

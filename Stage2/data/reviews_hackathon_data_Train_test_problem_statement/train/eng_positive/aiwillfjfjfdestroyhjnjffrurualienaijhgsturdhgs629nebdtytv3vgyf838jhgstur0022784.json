He managed the 8 hour itinerary of Recife and Olinda really well and even fitted in special requests from different members of the group of 8. He balanced the whole day so we were never under pressure and were able to enjoy a busy, hot but relaxing day. He has a lovely personality and everyone really enjoyed him. He knew of places not visited by the cruise ship tour groups -the unexpected fava dance demonstration was memorable. Best tour and tour guide on our whole cruise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T06:15:29.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

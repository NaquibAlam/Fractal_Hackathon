I had one ticket to the \"hard to get seats\" St George Open Air Cinema. But I needed another and the pre sale was sold out. So I had the choice of queing up on the night with hundreds of people in hope to get just one of 40 tickets available at the door, or I buy a ticket from TicketMaster Resale for just a fraction more but for peace of mind, Thankyou Ticketmaster Resale. You are brilliant and I'll be back again and again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:54:27.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I also like that you had a really good sale without having to buy an outfit first. I've bought many of you clothes and have been very satisfied. My biggest concern is that I always have ponder on whether to get a medium or large on a top. I bought the palazzo pant that have a dressy sweat that matches it and the top was too large, however, since it is a (sorta) sweat shirt, I decided to keep it. Also, I'm the worlds worst at sending things back. Also, I do follow the size guide and the large is generally okay....just a little big. and I would rather it be too large than too small. In this one case, I know that I could have worn a medium, unlike what the size chart advised. To sum up, I'm sure that I'll continue to order from you and enjoy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T04:52:05.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Kitchen was well furnished with everything you need. Appliances were upgrade appliances. The Woodburning fireplace was great. Make sure you bring your own wood, Hot tub was clean and relaxing Beds were clean and comfortable and had plenty of pillows. Cabin was conviiently located, close to everything but yet far enough out to be out of the congestion. 60 inch TV was great and chair and sofa in the living room were comfy, the sofa even reclined. Check in and check out was a breeze. We look forward to our next stay at Moondance Cabin and would most highly recommend to everyone to book with Outrageous Cabins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:38:09.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

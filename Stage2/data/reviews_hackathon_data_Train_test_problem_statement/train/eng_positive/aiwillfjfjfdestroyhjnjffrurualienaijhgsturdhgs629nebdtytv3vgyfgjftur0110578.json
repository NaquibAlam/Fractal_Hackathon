We got to the store and our salesperson Holly helped us make the decision to purchase. We appreciated her help and honest opinions. It felt that she genuinely wanted to help us. Something that we did not find during our recent visits to other furniture stores. She walked us through the delivery process and was very accommodating to our questions. The delivery was great. The drivers were courteous and helpful.

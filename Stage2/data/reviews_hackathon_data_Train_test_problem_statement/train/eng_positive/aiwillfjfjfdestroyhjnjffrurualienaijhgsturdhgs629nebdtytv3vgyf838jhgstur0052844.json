Everytime I need to quickly label the kids' belongings as we head out the door, I'm so happy I have a book of labels ready to stick on. The quality is excellent - I have all our food containers labelled and they've gone through the dishwasher many, many times and never come off. They're still in great shape and it's been two years. But if I want to remove a label, it's easy, there's no residue, and I can even re-use the label on something else.\nI just ordered clothing stickers and I'm excited that these will make my life easier, too. I have many hand-me-down clothes from someone who used these labels, and they've stayed on through the wash. And I WON'T HAVE TO IRON THEM ON! Because who has time for that?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T09:31:09.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

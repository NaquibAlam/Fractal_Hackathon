It is nice not having to plan meals or shopping lists, and the meals have taken me out of my comfort zone. My kids enjoy the meals as well, which is definitely a pleasant surprise. On the downside, the prep takes a little longer than the recipes indicate; for example, most recipes say prep takes 10 minutes, but I find more time is often required. Factoring in extra prep time required some adjustment at first, especially when on a time crunch. I also find the instructions use an inordinate amount of materials (i.e., several bowls, pans, pots, etc.) so that there is a lot to clean afterward. All in all I am happy with the service and would recommend it with those caveats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T23:01:27.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

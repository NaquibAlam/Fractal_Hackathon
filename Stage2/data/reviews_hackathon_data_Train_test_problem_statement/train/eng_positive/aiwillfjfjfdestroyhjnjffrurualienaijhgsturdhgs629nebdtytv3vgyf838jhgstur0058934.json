That being said I believe there is a couple flaws. One being that there is not enough wiring provided to run the on/off switch to the interior of the car, (the switch is under the hood) making it inconvenient to use regularly. And second, the demon eyes are only clearly seen when being used without the headlights being on, so its only really applicable either before the suns really up or when the sun is going down. Still, all in all, i really like the product, the headlights are very bright and it was an ease to install! Keep up the good work XKGLOW!! Ill be back for more!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T15:26:03.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

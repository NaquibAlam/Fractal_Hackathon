You get exactly what you pay for so when people complain about the quality of cheap items, that's to be expected, honestly. There was this one time I bought from them and never got my package, so I emailed them and they gave me the same amount of money I spent there in credit so I could buy there again for free! Even if it wasn't their mistake, but the mailing company's. That had me as their loyal customer, I buy there everytime I need new skincare products, or cute clothes, cute stationary, everything at a very low price. That plus the fact they hold crazy sales every now and then. PLUS the fact I always spend more than $35 so i always get free shipping. This is my 7th purchase with them and I will keep doing so. I seriously love yesstyle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:03:30.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

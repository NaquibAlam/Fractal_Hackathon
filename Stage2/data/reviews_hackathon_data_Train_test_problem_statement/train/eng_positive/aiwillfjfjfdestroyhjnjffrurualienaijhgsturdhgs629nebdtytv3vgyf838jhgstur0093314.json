I really wasn't looking forward to losing a day from my weekend but I found it to be enjoyable from start to finish in a comfortable, supportive and easy-to-learn environment. Best of all, at the end of training, I left feeling very confident that I could administer first aid if ever someone needed assistance and I sure didn't feel like that at the beginning of the day. Great training and content Paradise First Aid. Thankyou!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T02:41:08.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Went through some special details about my girl and my specific wants for her, such as no poultry, etc. My whippet won't eat any other biscuit now! Medium range in pricing. Can even prospond delivery or have it quickened. Exact food amounts to help prevent wastage and holding too much food. Overall for me and my whippet, Octavia. 5 stars all the way.

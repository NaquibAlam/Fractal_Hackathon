The have a comprehensive website, quick shipping, and a well developed return program if there were any mistakes (none in my case) as to which parts were shipped. While I do recommend supporting your local scooter shop (at least if you like having one), in the alternative should the parts you need not be available, or if you have no local shop, buy with confidence from SIP. They are amazing. And it goes without saying, if you have done any research online, that their pricing is very low. They make being a real scooterist possible.

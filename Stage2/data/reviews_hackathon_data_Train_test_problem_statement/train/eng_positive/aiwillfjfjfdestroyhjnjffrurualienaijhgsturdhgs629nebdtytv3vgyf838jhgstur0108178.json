I like that you didn't have to pay for it. The one thing that you don't know until later is to expedite it, you have to fill out one of their promotions. So since I was already in my place I did but they couldn't find that specific promotion so I had no option for expediting & now who knows how long this will take. I also wanted to fill out another one because I get mail in my married & maiden name, with this site you aren't able to use the same e-mail more than once.\nSo if you do this way in advance & only need to do it once or have a couple e-mails to use then it's perfect. However you don't always know where you will be moving to & when, which means I still need to make a trip to the post office.\nUPDATE:I am really glad I was in touch with customer service about these issues. They took care of the expedited issue immediately & then didn't stop until I could input another name to be changed as well. I have already seen my first expedited name address is being handled, now I'm waiting for the other.

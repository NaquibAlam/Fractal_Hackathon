Lyft had a driver appreciation day where they matched every tip up to $5 a driver got up to $20. So, a driver could have received 4 $5 tips and made $40. On the passenger side of things, Lyft is constantly doing promotions such as 50% off rides for the week in Charlotte. One last thing I love about Lyft is the support aspect of it. Every email I've sent has always been responded to on the same day, and by an actual person. I feel like they know me personally by now, and I love that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T20:47:58.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Our dogs are rescues and pretty high maintenance. Our kids used to pup sit but they are all older now and moved out and weren't available and I didn't want to find a stranger on Craigslist and have them stay in my home. I found Dog Vacay on Facebook and thought I would give it a try. Since it was a dedicated service, I felt it would be safe to have them in my home and that they would provide competent care for my fur babies. I met Miyuki prior to hiring her and she was great. Dog Vacay is a fantastic service - thank you for giving us the peace of mind to go on vacation again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T13:20:54.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Ever since then I have used endoca suppositories and it has helped me to control my nausea and sleep better. I am also type 1 diabetic and suffer from gastro paresis so nausea was a huge concern. I can only say I tried 1 night without it as I had run out and saw a huge difference the next night when my supply arrived. The reason for 4 stars is I have no idea about future use and effects, but, for now I'm happy with quality and exceptional service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:24:11.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

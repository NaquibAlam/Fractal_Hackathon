I live across the country from Green Lake and found them through social media. At first I was wary about spending so much money on a piece of jewelry that I would not see in person till the work was completed and payed for. But the more I read about the company and the more I talked to Vinh (my designer) the more comfortable I felt with my decision to go with them.\nLike many men looking for the perfect ring to give the woman they plan to spend the rest of their life with, I could not find a ring that I thought was worthy of her. Everything seemed generic and I had seen the same type of ring on every other woman's hand. Then i discovered Green Lake Jewelry and their website. They had many unique designs to choose from and even better, if you could not find one you liked you could make your own!\nOverall I was very happy with the service and the ring came out magnificently. I never thought I would have a jeweler but now I will definitely look at Green Lake first before I buy anything.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:09:55.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

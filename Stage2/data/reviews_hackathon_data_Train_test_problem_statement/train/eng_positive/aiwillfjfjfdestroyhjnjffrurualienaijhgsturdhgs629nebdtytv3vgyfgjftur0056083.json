Tom and his staff did a wonderful job answering questions and taking care of helping me place me order.\nWhen the package arrived, I was very pleased about the excellent job of how well and secure the coins were packed. It exemplified the level of service AGE provides to each customer. They take the time necessary to do the job correctly the first time - from inquiry to order, to final delivery.\nVery pleased with my experience and I will be returning to purchase more in 2017!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T21:34:39.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

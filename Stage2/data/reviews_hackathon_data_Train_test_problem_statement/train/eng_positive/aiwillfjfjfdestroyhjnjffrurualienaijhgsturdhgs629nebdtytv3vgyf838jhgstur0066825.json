Greg and Rusty worked diligently to make the experience smooth and easy for me.\nGreg took great pictures and provided exceptional tips on what else I could do to spruce up the site more. I had planned on getting a video of the boat in action but it sold before I got a chance. Feedback was spot on from Greg! Props for sure.\nRusty continued communication after we found a buyer what seemed like daily. He was very informative and made me feel comfortable about the seller/buyer experience.\nI will definitely recommend PopYachts in the future to any friends in my Boating Community whether it's buying or selling with the company. I have warm fuzzies about the company as a whole.\nThanks, so much, for all the hard work and the business model for continuing to strive for Excellence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T21:43:29.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

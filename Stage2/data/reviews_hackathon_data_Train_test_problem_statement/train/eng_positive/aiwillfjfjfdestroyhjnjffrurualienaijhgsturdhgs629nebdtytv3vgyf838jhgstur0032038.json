I was having issues printing off the tickets and kept running into barriers due to being in a wheelchair. I contacted TIcket City to see if ANYTHING could be done and I was sent a printout of the tickets. I am sooo grateful for this and the stress I was experiencing disappeared the moment the Dropkick Murphys/Interrupters tickets were in my hands.

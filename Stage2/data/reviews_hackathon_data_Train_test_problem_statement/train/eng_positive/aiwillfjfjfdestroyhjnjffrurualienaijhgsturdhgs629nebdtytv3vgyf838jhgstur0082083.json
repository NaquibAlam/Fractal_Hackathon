They had a great installation video for the ledges and I ordered 7 of them. They arrived last week (quickly) and I installed them today.\nThey went in easily and worked perfectly.\nThe fire pit now looks fantastic. I would highly recommend these to anyone building a fire pit.\nGreat product, great service.

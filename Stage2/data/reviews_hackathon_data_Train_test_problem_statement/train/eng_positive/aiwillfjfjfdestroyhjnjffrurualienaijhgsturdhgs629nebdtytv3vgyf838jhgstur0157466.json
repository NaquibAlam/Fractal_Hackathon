Imagine my surprise when less than three months into the program I've already received my first settlement offer and my negotiator Michael George is working on a second settlement offer. I figured we wouldn't hear from companies for a while. Michael has been especially wonderful. He has patiently, diligently, and thoroughly answered every question I have asked. He has always been very honest and upfront with me and he is working hard to get these accounts knocked out. I appreciate everything Americor Financial has done for me. I can't wait to get the call about the second settlement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:02:33.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Not knowing what to expect (our first order), we were thrilled when our order arrived well packed. The bread turned out to be the best we ever could find in the US. Three big loaves of excellent German rye bread, fresh, easy to cut and just perfect texture. So delicious! The salami was also excellent. All items were reasonable in price and shipping. We highly recommend LuxDeli!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:12:13.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

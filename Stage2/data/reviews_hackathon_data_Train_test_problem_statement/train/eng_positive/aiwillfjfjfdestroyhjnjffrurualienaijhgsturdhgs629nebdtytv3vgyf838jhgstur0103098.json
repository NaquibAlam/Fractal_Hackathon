Having reared my children and having plenty of 'my time' on my hands - I found myself with a lifelong love of animals a passion for writing and photography and a yearning to travel I discovered 'Trusted House Sitters' . To say my timing was not a coincidence is an understatement.\nFrom the outset of joining THS I cannot emphasise the help and support that I have received from the staff. To be honest the hardest part I found was sitting down and setting up my profile, however once I reached out to THS support line I was guided all along the way.\nI have completed copious house and pet sits to date. I just spent St Patrick’s week-end in a beautiful log cabin home in the company of two wonderful dogs, two cats and two horses in Northern Ireland.\nI cannot recommend Trusted House Sitters website enough. Daily, the site has been updated always with ‘ease of access’ in mind for the house sitters and home owners.\nLittle did I think the day I completed my profile on Trusted House Sitters in 2015 that today I would have completed wonderful sits in the Isle of Mann, Cornwall, Accost in the UK. Aghalee in Northern Ireland and two months in Lanzorote Spain, Howth, Kilkenny, Kildare and Co Meath. The icing on the cake for me with genuinely gratitude to everyone at Trusted House Sitters for their support I am heading off next month to spend three months in San Francisco – six weeks housesitting and spending the balance with my son and his wife and my three granddaughters.\nI have met amazing animals made great friends and now I have the opportunity of a lifetime to meet new friends and spend quality time with my much-missed grandchildren all thanks to Trusted House Sitters. Thank you so much.\nDerry-Ann Morgan\nDublin\nIreland", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:34:07.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

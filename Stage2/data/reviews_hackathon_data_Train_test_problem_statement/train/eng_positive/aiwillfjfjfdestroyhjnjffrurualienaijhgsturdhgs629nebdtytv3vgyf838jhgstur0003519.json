It's a good way to see many different flights and choose the best one for you. What annoys me though is the seat selection portion. If you select a seat (actually, if you select a seat preference - aisle, window, etc), you are charged 10$ per selection. The most ridiculous part, it's not guaranteed. So, fair warning, just leave it blank, and then select your seats (for free) when you check in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:58:57.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

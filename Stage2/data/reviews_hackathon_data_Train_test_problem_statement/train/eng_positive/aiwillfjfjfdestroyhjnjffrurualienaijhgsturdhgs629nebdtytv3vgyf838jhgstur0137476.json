The only problem was we couldn't get an airport drop-off at 7.30am. Apart from that, I'd recommend Ace to anyone.\nHowever something I noted was a hire to some Japanese tourists. There was a very helpful road video playing in the office displaying our road rules etc which I watched but these tourists never looked at it once. I think it should have been compulsory viewing for any arriving tourists before they are allowed to hire a car. They should also have to prove they have been in the country for at least 24 hours before their hire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T08:57:52.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

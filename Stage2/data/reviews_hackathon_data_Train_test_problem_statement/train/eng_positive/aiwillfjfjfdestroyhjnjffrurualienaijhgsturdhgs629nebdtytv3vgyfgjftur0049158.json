I have had 7 sessions on my tattoo now and the results are real! Be warned that it does take time because some people are looking for an overnight result. Not gonna happen.

I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a laser treatment for their tattoo or anything else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:40:44.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

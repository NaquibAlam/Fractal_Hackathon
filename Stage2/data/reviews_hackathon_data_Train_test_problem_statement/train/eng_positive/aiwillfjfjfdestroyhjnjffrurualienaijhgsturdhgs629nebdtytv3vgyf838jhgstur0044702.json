Another aspect of their service that I'd like to highlight is that it saves us a tremendous amount of time, as they have already filtered the top candidates for us.\nI highly recommend Toptal and will continue to be a happy customer of theirs!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:16:33.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

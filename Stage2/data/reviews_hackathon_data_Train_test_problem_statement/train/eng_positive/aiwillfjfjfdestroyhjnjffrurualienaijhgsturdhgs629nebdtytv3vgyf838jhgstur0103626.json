We knew the du Barry pearls that had belonged to my mother in law where not expensive but they had great sentimental value especially to my daughter as she had a very close bond with her grandmother. The jewellers in NZ said they weren't valuable and couldn't help her. She was so upset. I told my daughter that on my next visit back to NZ I would get the pearl necklace from her and take it back to Melbourne. I got the opposite response from Trewarne jewellers, they listened to my story and then provided a solution for me, they were so sympathetic. They went to a lot of trouble looking for a clasp that would suit the pearl necklace. The staff restrung the necklace as the threads were so worn on them and cleaned them. The necklace looks so lovely now and I know my daughter is going to be so happy on her wedding day wearing her Gran's pearls. I can't recommend these jewellers enough for the wonderful service they gave me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:14:36.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

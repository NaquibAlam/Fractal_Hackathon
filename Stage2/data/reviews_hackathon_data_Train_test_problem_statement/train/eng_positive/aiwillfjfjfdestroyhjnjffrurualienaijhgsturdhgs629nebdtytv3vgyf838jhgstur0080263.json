My slides were delivered in 2 days after purchase. Customer service was wonderful when I contacted them about returning them for a smaller size. I wear an 8 but needed a 7 as they run a little big. She cancelled my order, refunded my money within 2 days and I purchased my smaller size. They are super cute and can't wait to wear them on my birthday trip to Thailand. I'll be purchasing from here more often.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T22:46:53.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

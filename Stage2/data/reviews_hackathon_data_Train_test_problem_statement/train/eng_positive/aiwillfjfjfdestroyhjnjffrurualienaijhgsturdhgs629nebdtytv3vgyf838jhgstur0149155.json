I called Marine parts and spoke to Miguel and he found a pair that would work for me because they did not have the 13 inch fenders in stock by the same brand. He went to the warehouse and measured them and sent me a diagram before I ordered them. He went above and beyond for me and I will absolutely be buying more parts from Marine parts.

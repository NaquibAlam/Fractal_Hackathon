She was so honest with me and let me know step by step what to expect. When at first my attempt at a \"deal\" was rejected, I freaked out. I was reassured that Jackie would work it out for me and she did. I am so glad I went to David Sklar for the help and would recommend to anyone who needs the help that I needed. as an adult who was scared and not sure of her future, I was reassured that everything would work out, and it did.\nThank you Jackie and David Sklar for helping me out and getting me where I am at this point in my life. although the payments seemed high at first I was able to do two payments a month to accommodate other bills etc.\nTHANK YOU!

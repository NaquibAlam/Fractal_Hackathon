I'm an avid book reader and I love that Thriftbooks has a WIDE selection of books to purchase for such a bargain. I found many books that I have not been able to find in years. As far as shipping and purchasing go, I give them a 10/10!!! You can't beat their $10 (if in US) free shipping deal!!! Even if you order under that amount you only pay $1 shipping per book and that's still an amazing deal. I just wish I would have found this amazing site sooner cause they have all the books from $3.59 on up (new and used) !!!! I have purchased from this company a couple times and my orders have always been on time and in good condition. I love Thriftbooks and will keep on continuing to buy books from them!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T21:06:39.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I used Home Advisor many times to start my projects. You punch in your needs and, instantly, receive several contractors to pick from for your project. They are displayed with reviews from previous jobs and are star rated so you can make an informed decision. Home Advisor makes it very easy to select your professional for your job.\nWhat I do not like about Home Advisor is their lack of response to your reviews; Often taking months to approve them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T20:59:03.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

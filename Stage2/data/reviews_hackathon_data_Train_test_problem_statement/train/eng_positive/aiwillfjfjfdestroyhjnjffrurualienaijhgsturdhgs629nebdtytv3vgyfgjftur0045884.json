You can't beat the prices. They're always having sales and promotions. They have tons of different products. I LOVE their \"recommended for you section.\" The packages always arrive correct, no mistakes. The reviews are verified so you are only getting reviews from actual buyers. It's very easy to become an elite gold member by writing reviews of the products you purchase which entitles you to an additional 10% off everything, plus four $10 coupons valid up to a year. The customer service is probably the best I've EVER dealt with. My package didn't arrive once, the tracking (you can follow your package the whole way) said it was delivered. I sent an email to the company- the same day they responded and asked me to check with my post office. I did and it wasn't there. They immediately shipped me out a new package with none of the hassle I'm sure we've all experienced in these situations. One of the products I ordered was no longer in stock, so they applied a credit for that amount to my account. This is probably my favorite skincare website ever). Highly recommend, totally reliable, great customer service, amazing products that actually work, aren't just hype, and are priced appropriately. I not only purchase often, I recommend it to everyone. So many brands, things to try.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:25:11.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

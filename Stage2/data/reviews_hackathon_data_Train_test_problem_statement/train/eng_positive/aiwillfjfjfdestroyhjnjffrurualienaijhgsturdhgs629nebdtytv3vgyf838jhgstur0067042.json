The fruit (and other treats, if ordered) come stunningly packed in a wooden crate with wood wool and the fruit is the very best available. The cherries at Christmas are a particularly good product and have become a family institution. Delivery is always on time and exactly as requested. They also deliver to smaller areas. It surprises me that they need so little notice for an order. I cannot recommend Snowgoose too highly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T15:44:30.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

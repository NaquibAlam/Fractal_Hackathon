I felt relaxed, reassured and above all, just enjoyed every moment of our tour. Out private driver Hassan ( the \"First\"of Morocco tours) was so attentive and protective and insured our comfort and safety all throughout. The accommodations were exceptional and the private guided tours were all informational. The best was Halid who guided us in Fes. I will definitely refer this company with enthusiasm and again, thank you Aiste, for making this trip a truly memorable experience. Grace Brown of MA.

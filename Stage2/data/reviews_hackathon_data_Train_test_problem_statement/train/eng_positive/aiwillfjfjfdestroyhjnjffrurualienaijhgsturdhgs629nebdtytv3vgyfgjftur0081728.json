It states the Total Trihalomethanes (TTHM), four volatile organic chemicals which form when disinfectants react with natural organic matter in the water were over the maximum contaminant level. People who drink water containing trihalomethanes in excess of the maximum contaminant level (MCL) over many years may experience problems with their liver, kidneys, or central nervouse system, and may have an increased risk of getting cancer.\nEnough for me. Two years ago we installed a Pelican System on our home. We recentlly had the water tested and the lab says the water has no chemicals or other compounds which are harmful. Glad I made the decision to buy.\nWe had a minor problem with the delivery and return of an item but Pelican made it right and we are completely satisfied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:13:50.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

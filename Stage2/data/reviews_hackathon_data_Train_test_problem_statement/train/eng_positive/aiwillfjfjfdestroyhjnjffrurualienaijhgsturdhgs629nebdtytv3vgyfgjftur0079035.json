All the keys for your games are sourced from the game publishers/developers themselves so you can purchase safe in the knowledge that the game keys are all legit. e.g. I just bought a deluxe version of a game here for 5.99 so it came with the season pass for all the DLC. At the exact same time that game was still selling for at least 24.99 on Steam... and it was a Steam key that I received upon purchase here! I've been getting stuff from this company for a while now and I have never once had any problem whatsoever. Once your purchase is made, your keys are available within a few seconds. Take a look, you have nothing to lose here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:34:23.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Recently ordered 4 perfect fit venetian blinds for a pair of patio doors and kitchen window and they were half the price of Hillary's Blinds; £220 as opposed to £440.The company is very helpul and I have called them with technical queries on a couple of occasions and they are very helpful. They even sent me out a sample of their Perfect Fit venetian blind frame so I could check if there was enough clearance around my patio doors as I have protruding vents along the top of the frame. Their Perfect Fit venetian blinds (in the conservatory section of their website) look great and are such a doddle to assemble and install that it takes more time to unpack them than fix them to the window! Just be accurate with your measurments on this type of blind, but they do give you a little wiggle room. Deliveries are always ahead of the predicted timescale. I wouldn't go anywhere else for blinds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:41:33.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

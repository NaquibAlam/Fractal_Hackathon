She took the time to show me what I had already booked but after viewing the storage and looking over the items that I told her I was bringing she went above and beyond to showed me a bigger space. At fir st I was skeptical--- thinking she was only trying to get a better deal out of me but after looking at the second unit and telling her my budget I ended up with the WIN, bigger space and $2 under budget.\nOn the way up to the floor where my unit is located, Betty made sure she explained about lighting, hours of operation and where cameras where located. She went over the code and how to use it when entering the building. She took the time to show me how to look at the diagrams on the wall that would lead me to my storage unit. Very informative- -- explaining in detail how to apply the lock to the storage properly. She then had me try, to ensure I did it right. (Thanks Betty)\nWhen we headed down to the lobby she was patient with me as I made sure I had the right visa card to make transaction. What impressed me most about this experience was she actually went over the whole contract, even the fine print!!! A lot of times people just scurry through asking you for signature and initials and your responsible for looking at what is really important. She did complete opposite, EXCELLENT.\nI said to her then, \"If we had more people like you in customer service, the world would be a better place, don't change\" and I meant that.\nKeep up the great work Betty ;)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:21:56.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

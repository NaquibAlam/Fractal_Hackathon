The elevators are nice and wide allowing for fewer trips, the covered parking awesome for the rain and the check out system for carts ensures they are in one location and returned. Our nightmare experience with Extra Space including tiny elevators (you couldn't get anything wide in the doors), uncovered parking (in the rain) and you were on your own to find one of four carts in the entire storage to use. Only negative is there really should be a way to have access to at least one cart when the unit is closed on Sundays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:32:37.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

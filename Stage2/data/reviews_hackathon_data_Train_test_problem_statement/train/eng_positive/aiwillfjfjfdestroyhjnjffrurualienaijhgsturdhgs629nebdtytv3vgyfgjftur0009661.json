We received great help from Angela, as she helped us find the unit that would fit our needs. This is an older facility, but the units were in good shape, and they offered larger sized units than other facilities in the area. Our only trouble was trying to get a 26' U-haul truck to our unit location. The paved roadways can be narrow in some spots, but only for a truck this size; regular vehicles will have no problem navigating around the facility. We considered this our best choice for storage in this part of Austin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T23:09:29.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

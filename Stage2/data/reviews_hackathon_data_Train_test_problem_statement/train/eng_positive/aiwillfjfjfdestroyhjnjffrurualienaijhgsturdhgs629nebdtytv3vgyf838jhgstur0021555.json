Their selection of music, books and audiobooks is pretty good. If you like horror movies and documentaries, especially music docs, you'll like the movie section. I can't really comment on the games because I don't play any of them, but their audiobook section is terrific. My only complaint is about the search box; it's actually not very good because it doesn't pick up a lot of searches so you end up stumbling upon what you're looking for in their curated lists or by browsing the entire collection. Overall, though, I'm satisfied with the service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T10:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T23:13:06.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

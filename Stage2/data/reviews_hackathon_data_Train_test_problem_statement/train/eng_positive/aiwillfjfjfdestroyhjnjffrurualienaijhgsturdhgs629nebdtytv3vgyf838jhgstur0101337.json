For example, I got charged $88.98. A simple email or sms to say : You have been charged for two more days for the car, for use on the 22/3 and 23/3. Thank you.\nBecause if i keep the car longer than just two days, one look at my cc and i see a lot of amounts being charged but can't clearly understand what exactly it is for.\nThanks", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:36:33.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

But even Glasses Direct's list prices beat the major high street opticians, and the cost of extras (coatings etc.) is very reasonable. There's a decent choice of frames for everyday use, plus \"designer\" ones if you want to spend a little more on something a bit different. The glasses were delivered within a couple of weeks, which is comparable with other opticians I've used.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:21:16.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

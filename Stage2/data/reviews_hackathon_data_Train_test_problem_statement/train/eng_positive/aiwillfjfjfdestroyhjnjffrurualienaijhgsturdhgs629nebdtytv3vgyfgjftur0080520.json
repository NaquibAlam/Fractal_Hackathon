As we were also planning a big wedding at the same time, I really appreciated how easy Robin made it for us to plan our honeymoon! She could not have been more helpful in working with us to create a customized honeymoon by listening to what kind of experience we were looking for and making suggestions that would enhance that experience, all within our budget. This may not have been the easiest task since we were looking for it all: luxury, relaxation, adventure, and planned out details with built in wiggle room for spontaneity.\nRobin helped us create a honeymoon that exceeded our expectations- we stayed in 3 locations throughout Costa Rica, soaked in awesome hot springs at one hotel, indulged in spa treatments and an infinity pool at another hotel, had access to a private beach, and Robin even worked out upgrades to an amazing honeymoon sweet at our last hotel. The views were just stunning. We rode ATVâ€™s, hiked the rainforest, explored waterfalls, and interacted with wildlife. Planning was easy and fun, and everything went SO smoothly when we were there. Having the little behind the scenes details worked out beforehand made all the difference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:17:56.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was so pretty and convenient. Having used for almost 2 weeks, I found it very handy because it includes a SIM pin and a space to place your sim card - perfect for travel (my pin and sim cards were always gone:(( ), not to mention the wallet part of the case. They also do sweet packaging with a thank you card attached. Would surely recommend it to my friends ;)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:27:02.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

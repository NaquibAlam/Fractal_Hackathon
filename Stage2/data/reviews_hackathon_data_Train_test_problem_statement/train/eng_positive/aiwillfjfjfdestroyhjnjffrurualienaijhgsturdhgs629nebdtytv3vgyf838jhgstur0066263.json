They had me in and out with my tires and FANTASTIC prices within an hour to an hour and a half. They are conveniently located, (I did some shopping while waiting) and it took no time at all. All the staff was friendly, and welcoming. Josh Pierce got me the best rate on tires around!!! I highly suggest going to Town Fair Tire, I know I will be returning!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:20:28.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

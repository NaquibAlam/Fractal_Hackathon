The gentleman I spoke to was polite, knowledgeable and answered all my questions.

These were delivered on a next day service, sooner than I expected.\nThe quality of the items is fantastic with good attention to detail and a correct fit for advertised size, something of a novelty these days.\nI would recommend Goldtop without hesitation and look forward to using them in the future - try them, you won't be disappointed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T17:03:33.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Thats quite a feat with Thriftbooks considering all sales over 10$ have free shipping. Not to mention you can get books that are still brand new for half or more off. I got a copy of a book thats only 3 months old 28$ originally, and only paid 13$ for it. Most of the books are labeled as used, but i have yet to get any that I would consider anything less than good condition. I especially like the former library copies. They are hardcover new books with plastic covers over the dust cover!

On the day I went to have it removed I experienced car trouble so i took it to a auto repair shop and later experienced a service lockout because of not having it serviced in time. However, with the assistance of one of the best customer care specialist smart start has to offer (Brittany Justice) I was quickly given a few simple steps and in a matter of 5 to 10 minutes was back on the road. She not only helped me with getting a lockout code but made sure that I wasn't charged for a late fee since I had documentation on having my vehicle in the shop. She was a major help and deserves recognition because it's not everyday that you receive assistance from someone with a great attitude and one that doesn't overwhelm you with questions. Smart Start is defiantly the right option when it comes to installing an interlock device because they offer locations all over the map and it come with a great team that is ready to assist any problem!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T19:24:44.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

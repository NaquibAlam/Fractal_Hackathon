They were worried about my budget and suggested a couple other lenses, but I really wanted the best and went with the Canon at the end of all of our conversations. I hope it's as good as all the reviews I've read.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T02:01:33.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

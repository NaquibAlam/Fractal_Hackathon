My recent on line order had a ridiculous shipping charge which I planned to contact them about. However, I was contacted by them (before I even had a chance to call), telling me that their website had over charged the shipping amount. Needless to say...that impressed me!! Actually, I have always been impressed by their service whether by phone or their prompt delivery and good packaging of a shipment.\nGreat product and service!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T12:10:57.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

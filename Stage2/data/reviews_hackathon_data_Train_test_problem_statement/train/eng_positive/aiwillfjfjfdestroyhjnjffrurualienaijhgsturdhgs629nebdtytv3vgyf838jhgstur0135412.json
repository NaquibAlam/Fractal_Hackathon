I went through play asia website and it looked like professional website.\nI had purchased 1 OEM key which I tried and it worked. Thats great.\nNobody else can provide genuine microsoft windows 10 professional at this rate. I recommend go for this website.\nEntire process of purchase, payment and receipt of code works seamlessly. I paid using paypal. And immediately received product key at my email.\nIts also important to mention that I had purchased 3 product keys out of which first when I purchased didn't worked. Throwing an error that \"This key is already used\" I had sent an email about the issue. Customer support had handled it professionally and understood the issue. They issued a new key immediately next day. And that key worked. Thereafter I had purchased 2 more keys which worked perfectly without any issue. I really recommend this as a genuine website to buy digital content.\nKeep it up", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:42:06.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The house, Peace of Paradise, was perfect and gave us the ability to spread out and enjoy the space that was provided. All families had a private bedroom and bathroom. I thought that the town would draw them to explore and visit, however, the pool, the beach and the house kept our group with children aged 2 to 8 busy and engaged. It was a fabulous and memorable time for us and we are contemplating doing it again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:55:41.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A food/recipe delivery company was exactly what I needed. The recipes are fantastic, ranging from roast chicken to shrimp risotto. There is still some prep work, but they try to keep it to a minimum. You'll have to chop onions and herbs, but they will send you shrimp that is already peeled and deveined. The portions are substantial. I was expecting small portions to maximize profits, but I'm always very full at the end of a meal. The meals are very grain/veg forward, but there's still plenty of protein. Having groceries delivered and a variety of recipes is worth every penny.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:31:26.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

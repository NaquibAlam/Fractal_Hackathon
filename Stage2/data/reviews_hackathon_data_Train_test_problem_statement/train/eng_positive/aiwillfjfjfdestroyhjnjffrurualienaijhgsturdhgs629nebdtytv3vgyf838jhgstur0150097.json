The weather cancelled one of our tours and 2 weeks post cancel our agent was able to secure a refund. Appreciated his persistence. This is not a guided tour where you are with the same group through out your trip and Goway customizes to your needs. The only change might be to not take the trek across from Queenstown to Christchurch as we had to then fly back to Auckland to San Fransico to Minnespolis. Seemed even longer after that 12 hour coach bus trek the day prior. Getting in at 9:15 pm and scheduled to head for the airport at 8 am left us no time to see anything.\nMichael was very helpful and I must say the Elite tour to the Eco thermal park, the Whakerwarewa Forest and Maori Ceremony made Rotorua my favorite stop. The glo worm caves were abbreviated due to weather so a little disappointed but weather can't be controlled. Auckland had great restaurants as did Davenport. Queenstown very picturesque and Milford Sound is a must see. Goway specializes in this area so I appreciated Michaels insights. Saw a lot in 10 days and friendly welcoming country. Back packers dream with limited bugs and no poisonous creatures. Wished we could have done the black sand beach and rain forest but again weathers fault not Goways. I would book again with them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:13:43.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

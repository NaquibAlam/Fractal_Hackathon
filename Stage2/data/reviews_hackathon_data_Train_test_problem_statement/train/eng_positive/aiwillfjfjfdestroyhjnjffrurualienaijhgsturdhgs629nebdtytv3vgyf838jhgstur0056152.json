I got the best crop of cherries we'd ever had! My husband had built my bee house and they hibernated over the winter in it. They were back the following Spring. Unfortunately, we sold the house the following year and my bee buddies stayed in Missouri. Now, in Virginia, I am starting a new colony of Orchard Bees. The people at Brushy Mountain were very helpful - answering all my questions. The bees arrived safely and stayed in my refrigerator until it was warm enough. The company carries a full line of honey bee equipment as well. I recommend Brushy Mountain highly!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T23:34:20.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The only annoyance I have with the system is not getting the exact rate of the transfer until it's done. It makes it very hard to compare to other options and evaluate who can give you the best deal. It is definitely better pricing then a bank and the the little bit of an idea on rate you can get is better than the information a bank was a able to give me on how they get their rates. Would use again but would like more transparency on the rate, like a 24 hour lock on rate (i.e. you get rate x if you get your wire transfer in done within 24 hours etc)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:02:32.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

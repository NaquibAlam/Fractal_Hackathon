But, I need a transmission for my Pathfinder and Street Smart seemed to be my best option. What l found out through every step of the process is that this company operates exactly how their web site and videos claim. It was an extremely easy process. They delivered the transmission and radiator to my house and the driver took the delivery off the truck and set it down at my garage door. After I completed the install I called Street Smart and the core exchange was set up and just like that the core was gone and I had my pathfinder back on the road with a new radiator and refurbished transmission with no hidden surprises. The only reason that I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is that the transmission and radiator have only been in the Pathfinder for a couple weeks. However, as long as it keeps working the way it has been, which is flawless, I would change the review to 5 star. Only time will tell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T22:51:08.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

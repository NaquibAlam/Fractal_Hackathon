They were very kind and helpful. Everything arrived in plenty of time and all of the materials were of excellent quality. We purchased one of the kits (net, composite racquets, bags, etc.), a couple of extra paddles, and outdoor balls. The bags are nice to lug the equipment around. It's an easy enough sport that my 4 and 6 year old boys are able to play with their older brothers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:20:35.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

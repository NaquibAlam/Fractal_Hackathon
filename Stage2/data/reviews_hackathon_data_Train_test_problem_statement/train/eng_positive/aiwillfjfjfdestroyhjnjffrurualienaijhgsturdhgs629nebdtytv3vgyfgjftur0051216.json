My wife and I are very pleased and the total cost was very competitive. The adjustable split king bed base and mattresses are very comfortable, easy to operate, and are as quiet as I expected.. One slight issue: I ordered the delivery and assembly option, and I'm glad I did because each of two parts weighs about 150 lbs, my bedroom is on the 2nd floor and the staircase has three 90 degree turns. The logistics company (from Romulus, Michigan) did an excellent job of communicating but, unfortunately, the sole delivery/assembly person was reluctant to attempt carrying the bed base to the 2nd floor without damage so a second delivery was schedule for a few days later. Again, only one guy (a different guy -- James) showed up. However, James was able to carry the base parts upstairs by himself with no damage to the staircase, walls or wood work. He was very pleasant and competent and assembled the base and mattresses in good time. Actually, I'm glad delivery/assembly guy #1 was aware enough NOT to attempt delivery if he was unsure he could handle it. The lesson: the bed is great, the mattresses are comfortable and the price was right but, if you go for the delivery/assembly option, be sure to advise the logistics company in advance about any potential issues like stairways with turns to upper floors!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:04:14.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

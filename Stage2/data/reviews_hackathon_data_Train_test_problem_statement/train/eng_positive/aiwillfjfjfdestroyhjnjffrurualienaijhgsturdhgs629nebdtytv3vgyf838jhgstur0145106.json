But all the way from the UK? Is this site for real? What about the exchange rate? Everything on Wiggle's US site is priced in US dollars and that is what you pay. No extra tax, exchange rate, or shipping costs (if over $50, which isn't hard to do).\nShipping does take 2 weeks or so, but so far all of my orders have been delivered, and I have been happy with the products. I recommended to my Dad who is a cyclist, and he really enjoys the deals and quality so far too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:25:44.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

But Daryl the customer service representative that helped us, did everything he could to make sure we had a place to stay for the night. An as he promised sent us links to another resort to accommodate all the guest that we had. Because our experience at the first hotel we said at was a nighmear. The next day Daryl's co worker Leah took over the process of getting us into another resort. She made sure that we didn't have to spend any extra money an just placed the money we already spent towards another resort with the room we thought we were getting. Daryl an Leah SAVED our vacation. I would definitely recommend Vacatia to anyone who is needed to plan a vacation an get the most for there money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:05:14.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

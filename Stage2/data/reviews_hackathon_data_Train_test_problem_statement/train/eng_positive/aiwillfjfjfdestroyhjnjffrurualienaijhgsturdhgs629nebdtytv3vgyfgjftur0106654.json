Bought a small amount to see how quick and professional they were. Pleasantly surprised when my gold was received within a few hours. This is the first site that actually kept their word. Other sites like MMOGA took over a week to even receive half of my order. SeaGM also sent other items in the mail with the gold so it didn't look shady to any GM watching the mail. Thanks again guys, you've secured a customer for life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:45:00.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I've tried several different brands including well know Ones such as Bellami , and they just don't compare . Luxy hair is so thick and luxurious ,super shiny ,and will last as long as u take good care of them. These don't shed and are so thick you don't even have to use all the wefts. I'd love to have these In every color because they are just that great. I will forever buy luxy hair !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:13:16.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

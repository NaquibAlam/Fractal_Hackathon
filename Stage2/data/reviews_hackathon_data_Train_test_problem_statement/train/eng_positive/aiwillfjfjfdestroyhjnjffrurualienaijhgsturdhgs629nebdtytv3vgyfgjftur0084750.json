This is the first box that I have had this happen (out of 3 or 4). Tonight, I made a chicken dish which called for 2 Tblsp of Dijon mustard and the recipe assured me that more than this had been sent. In actuality, only about 1/2 Tblsp was sent-2 little packs. I had to fill in with my own mustard to come up to the called out amount. This was OK in the sense that I had mustard but I feel that I should have all the ingredients called for-after all, that is what I am paying for. But, the veggies and meat and recipes overall are great and I am very pleased, over all. These were just minor difficulties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T23:00:14.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Make sure you read the reviews beforehand bc I find that the sizes are often very different from American sizes.

Also when it charges to your card (I use Bank of America), it also adds a conversion fee, which I didn't realize beforehand (and also added a conversion fee when I got a partial refund for a product they did not have in stock - so I was essentially paying for something that wasn't my fault? - though I guess it might not have been YesStyle's fault either that their vendors didn't have the listed product)..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:31:35.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

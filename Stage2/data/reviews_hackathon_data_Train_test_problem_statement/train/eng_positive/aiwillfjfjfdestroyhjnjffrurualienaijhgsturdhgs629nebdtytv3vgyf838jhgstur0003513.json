The first time I booked on the phone because I had never heard of FlightHub and wanted to make sure they were legitimate since I was booking an expensive multi-city flight. The flights all worked out.\nThis second flight was easier since it was one city and back. I like the ease of finding my flight with the website. I love that telephone help is provided anytime. The fights are also the cheapest I can find.\nI screwed up with my booking because I accidentally booked insurance. I did not want it. I noticed I had booked insurance when I saw what my credit card was being charged. I quickly called FlightHub, and the representative was pleasant and removed it for me.\nI am so happy I found FlightHub. This is one of the better flight finder sites out there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T11:19:17.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

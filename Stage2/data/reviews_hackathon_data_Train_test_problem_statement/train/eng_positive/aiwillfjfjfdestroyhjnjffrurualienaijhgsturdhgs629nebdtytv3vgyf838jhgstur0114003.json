I was told about the site by a friend, but was very cautious about using it at first. Now I don't think twice - it's the perfect way to know your pet and home are safe and happy. We've now had three different sitters, another two in the pipeline - one couple we've had a pre sit meetngreet over lunch with.\nThe TH website navigation is different and improving all the time, due to the nature of the service the website provides and it's priority in confidentiality and security.\nThe additional agreements and manuals are another great idea and useful for us all. It's adding the little information things, such as location of the indoor garage switch, that makes the sitters stay more successful for everyone.\nJust love it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:33:41.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

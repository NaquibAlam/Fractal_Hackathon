The following day I changed my mind as I work quite close to the AllGifts.ie office, so I contacted AllGifts.ie to see if I could change the delivery option. Sarah replied to my email almost immediately and had my vouchers ready for collection when I called soon after. I was warmly welcomed with a smile. I collected a second voucher the following day and had the same great service. I would definitely recommend AllGifts.ie to everyone!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:31:44.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

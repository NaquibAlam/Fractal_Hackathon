Honestly, from start to finish, everything exceeded our expectations. Detailed itineraries gave us absolutely every bit of information we needed and every single pickup, tour, etc. was timed to perfection. Our private drivers were always early, incredibly knowledgeable and provided educational experiences we had no idea we would be getting. I think other travelers that we met along the way wished they had such well coordinated plans. Our two hotels were beautiful and perfect for our desired vacation. We can hardly wait for our next Costa Rican vacation....but we'll be bringing the kids on this one! When we are ready, we are certain that Caitlyn will be able to put together a vacation that will really please a couple of teenage boys!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:23:57.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

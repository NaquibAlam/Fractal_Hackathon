Just wish the description gave more information about the dress, like the inside support, lining, mesh areas. My dresses back is completely mesh which I didn't realize, you couldnt tell it was that way from the picture. I assumed I wouldn't be wearing a bra with this dress anyway so I don't mind but it would have been nice to know prior to purchase. I was also a little worried about the inside bra support of the dress it didn't specify if the dress had any, which it really doesn't. I love the dress though just wish the description about the dress was better. Overall it's a great product", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:24:09.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

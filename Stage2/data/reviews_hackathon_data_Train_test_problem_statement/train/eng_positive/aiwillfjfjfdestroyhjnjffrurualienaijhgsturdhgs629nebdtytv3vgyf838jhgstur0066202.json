However, I do have a suggestion regarding printed instructions that come with products that need to be put together. I ordered the Cypress Solar Meltzer on my last order (catalog #825). When I attempted to put it together the instructions had been photo copied and the step by step images where so dark you could not see the photo image clearly, some I could not make out at all. Now, I am an inexperienced bee keeper that need clearer instructions on how to put things together. It would have been helpful for the individual part to be better identified in both written and photo set instructions. I finally got it put together after several hours of trial and error. Also, the instructions did not mention should this Melter be painted or not.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T08:37:12.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

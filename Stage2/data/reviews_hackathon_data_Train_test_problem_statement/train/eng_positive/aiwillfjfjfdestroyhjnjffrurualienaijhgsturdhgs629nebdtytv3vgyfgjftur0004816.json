I noticed prices were going up rapidly for the dates I was searching. My best priced flight was to book two different airlines. I spent over an hour booking my flight to Phoenix through Air Canada utilizing a credit voucher so this had to be done via telephone. In the last couple of minutes while waiting for the A/C travel agent to confirm my flight, I booked my return flight through Alaskan Airlines within seconds and was confirmed before the A/C travel agent returned from putting me on hold. Flighthub is fast, simple and seamless!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:07:35.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

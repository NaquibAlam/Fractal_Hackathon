I went to their live chat (which was great) and was told to call the 1-800 # for a full refund and to rebook. They said full refund was possible as I called within 4 hours of making the reservation. I was dealt with very professionally, was given the opportunity to choose another flight time at an additional fee, but in the end, I was happy to do that because my entire air travel was such a great price. To top it all off, the agent offered to make my seat reservation at no extra charge because of the hiccup. This saves me both time and money, so I am a happy camper. I will recommend CheapOAir to everybody....I already do....LOL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:47:24.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

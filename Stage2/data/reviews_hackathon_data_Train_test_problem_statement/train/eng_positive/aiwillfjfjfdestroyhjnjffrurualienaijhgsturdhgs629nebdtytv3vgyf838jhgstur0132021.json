Still, I had my heart set on a mid size SUV that me and my sales person went over, yet land up not qualifying due to my wages! I did have to make a trip from Lafayette twice in a uhaul, due to financing requesting that I first produce a Indiana identification card, and I have a valid Illinois license.

We would have loved to get the vehicle that we sorta signed for during our pre qualification process, yet we appreciate that my brother in law introduced us to Oak motors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:29:30.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Caitlyn had helped me throughout the process. I am buying from abroad, she has kindly answered all my questions via email on a timely fashion, and also helped to organise a meeting where my relative in the US could come in the NewYork office to see all of the stones I liked and the settings that could potentially match them. I received the stone shortly after the requested GIA certificate was produced and I was thrilled by the beauty of it. I have since taken it to my local jewelers to fit the stone onto a setting (i couldn't decide which setting would fit well with my wedding band as it was being resized), and the gemologist at the jeweler had also praised the good value for money and high quality of the stone. Thank you for making me a very happy bride to be!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T16:12:23.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Fitter was polite and well educated and took great care whilst fitting the tyres. There was a slighte issue with a valve which I found to be leaking causing the tyre to deflate. Called up and spoke to a lovely member of staff who got someone out to sort out the valve today. Great service all round and a pleasure to deal with.

Plants were packaged well and looked very healthy upon arrival. Built a trellis just for these plants. They went into my new garden on 3-1-17. Then we had those nights in the low 20's. I was a little concerned the plants may not recover. It's 3-27-17 and the plants are sprouting new buds on the vines. A testament to how they earned their name, Arctic Kiwi. Would recommend to anyone interested in growing Kiwi, in Georgia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T08:48:49.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

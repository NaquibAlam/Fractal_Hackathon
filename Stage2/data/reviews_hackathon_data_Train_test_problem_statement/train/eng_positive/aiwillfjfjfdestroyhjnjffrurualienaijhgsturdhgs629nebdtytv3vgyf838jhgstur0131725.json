I purchased all new rotors, pads, E-brake shoes and hardware for my F150. All of the components were delivered as ordered. The made a call before charging my card to verify my identity too. The warranty stated that all torque spec must be used or it will be void. I called to confirm my axle nut torque specs as well as my lugs and they got me the answer right away. Nice to know I can call and talk to a real person, and that all of the products are manufactured right here in the US.\nKeep up the great work! I'll be returning for sure!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:44:05.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

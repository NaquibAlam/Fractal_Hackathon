I am very health conscious and a wellness professional. I like shellfish, but do not like fish. If it is even remotely fishy tasting I can not eat it. I know that if the salmon is very fresh it won't taste like fish. I decided to finally give Vital Choice a try after reading countless reviews over the last several months. I ordered the 6 oz. Skinless Boneless King Salmon - So glad I did! WOW! The salmon was amazing! It had no fishy aroma whatsoever and the flavor and texture was delicious. My husband and mother-in-law also said \"this is the best salmon I've ever eaten\". That's all we talked about for a week was how good the salmon was and couldn't wait to eat it again. I will definitely be ordering again and hoping the quality remains the same. If it does, I will be a very loyal customer. Thank you Vital Choice!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:11:32.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It is easy to communicate with listers. I like the categories of information that is included in listings. I like that \"employers\" provide an online guide that fleshes things out in more detail when your \"assignment\" nears. I like that emergency veterinary assistance is available (I hope I never have to use it!).\nI do have a couple of suggestions for the website. Maybe I didn't use the filters to their potential, but I couldn't find a way to search within a range of dates that match my availability. Also, it might be helpful to limit the number of applications that a lister could receive, it might have reduced the frustration I experienced in trying to get my first assignment. I was successful in getting local assignments but entirely unsuccessful for overseas ones. Maybe if the site prompted listers to indicate whether or not they are looking for local people only that might help? I didn't post a video as it would have required posting to YouTube first and I got lazy: it would have been nice if I could have downloaded my video directly to the TrustedHousesitters site.\nI definitely plan on listing my place next time I travel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:51:40.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

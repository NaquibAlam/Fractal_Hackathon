Size options are great! Overall finish is good with sharp precise cut lines except deepest cut around perimeter of raised panel next to routed curve up to face. This area requires lots of sanding before painting to remove rough finish. I ordered 15 pieces totaling about 60' and one piece was incorrect height dimension: ordered 26 3/4\", received 26 1/4\". Of coarse this was the longest piece at 143\", but I was able to add a 1/2\"strip at the bottom rather than return it. Would be nice to get primed or painted panels to better seal the cut edges of the MDF which sponge up the coating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:36:20.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

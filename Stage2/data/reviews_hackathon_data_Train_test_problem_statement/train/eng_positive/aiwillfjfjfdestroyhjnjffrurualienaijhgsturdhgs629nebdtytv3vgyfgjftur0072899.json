Fourteen years ago Luke sold this place to us, 15 years ago Arch Staver sold our last place for us. Over those years Luke, Arch & Nelson Alexander maintained the relationship and supported us in our other real estate endeavours. Last Saturday it all came together again and Arch did the honours and got us all, once again, a great outcome.\nThis wasn’t a straight forward sell. This property needed a team that “got” its special qualities and value. Luke and Rick Daniel did just that. They recognised the true value of the property, they planned and executed the dream campaign and they went over and above to ensure that prospective purchasers had everything they needed to buy with confidence. Then with Arch - is he the best Auctioneer in Melbourne or what? He did the job, hecklers and all. Maintained his professionalism in the face of challenges and got the outcome that the campaign had made available to us.\nDuring the campaign Luke was clear and forthright when he needed to be to ensure that we, as vendors, had all the information we needed. He also ensured that his professional advice was heard, even when we initially might have resisted. We’re grateful for that.\nFinally to the rest of Nelson Alexander, to the whole team of agents, to Monique Verga for making the admin wheels turn, to Charlie for introducing the buyer and for all sorts of other stuff that just happened without us being aware. A big thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:35:33.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

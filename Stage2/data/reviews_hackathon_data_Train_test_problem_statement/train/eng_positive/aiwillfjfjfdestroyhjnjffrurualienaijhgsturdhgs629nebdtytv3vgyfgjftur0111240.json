I recently purchased a tote bag and a print from them by an artist I had never heard of, Veronica Minozzi is an Italian artist, and creates beautiful digital artwork, many of animals. I collect rabbit items, and she had many to offer. It was hard to choose. I ended up purchasing a tote that was larger than I expected. I returned it, ordered a smaller one, as well as a print a different picture.\nI am delighted with both items, and highly recommend Fine Art America if you wish to own beautiful items for your home; items everyone will ask about, as they are not common, run-of-the-mill pieces of art. The prices are reasonable, the site is easy to navigate, the ordering process is simple, the return policy is fast and everything comes packaged very well to prevent damage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:26:03.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

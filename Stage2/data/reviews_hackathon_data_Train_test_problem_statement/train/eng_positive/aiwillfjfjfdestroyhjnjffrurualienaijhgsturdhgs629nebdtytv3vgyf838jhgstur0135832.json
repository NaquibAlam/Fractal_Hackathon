I asked that they not be heavily pruned and sent late as it's very cold here still. They came in awesome shape, very healthy, alive and safely packaged. And they're nice and big. Better than any other nursery I've ever ordered from. Bare root plants set better roots than potted too so they will be fast growing. They were boxed together with good root protection too. They are soaking and will be planted tomorrow. I'll always order from them again. The quality and value is perfect.

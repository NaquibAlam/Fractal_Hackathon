And I was worried about delivery to the country on the other side of the world from me. (Canada-Azerbaijan). Once I chose the bouquet and placed the order, the process of international delivery was easy, the delivery was available as soon as the next day, I didn't place any cards (that was offered by FloraQueen ) because I wanted it to be surprise. I must say I was impressed! They sent me emails to inform me of their every step, the delivery was prompt, the service is amazing, my relative didn't want to accept flowers since she didn't know the recipient, they emailed me right away to ask my permission to reveal my identity, surprise was successful thanks to FloraQueen! The bouquet was identical as seen on the website and fresh! Highly recommended!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T21:58:24.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Great quality merchandise & hassle free returns were the main reasons. The fact you are now carrying plus sizes has made me even happier. The fit of the XXL leggings & capris have been fine for me but not so much for the bras and tops. I can't wait to try on the 2 bras and the dress I ordered today. Thank you for providing us larger women with more options to enjoy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:11:08.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It exceeded my expectations regards quality given its budget price, however the stand did break when i leant (probably to heavily) on it.\nAn email to customer service on the night was answered start of next working day with \"we'll pop a replacement in the post\"... a replacement stand arrived the next day. (wow)\nOnly time will tell on the bikes longevity, however can't fault Bikes2udirect... buy with confidence .\nWell done and thanks for the great service ! 10 out of 10 from me :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:56:41.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

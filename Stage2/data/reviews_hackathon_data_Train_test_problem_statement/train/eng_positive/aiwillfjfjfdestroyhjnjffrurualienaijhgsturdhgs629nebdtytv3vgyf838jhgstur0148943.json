I ordered a simple set of spark plugs. The USPS lost them. (And you want THEM to be in charge of your healthcare? Really??!) When they didn't show up, and tracking showed them going missing in Jersey, I called. They didn't make excuses. They didn't leave me on hold. They did the right thing! They UPS'ed another set out to me immediately, and issued a call tag for the missing ones, just in case they showed up. I received my second order of plugs quickly. My first order showed up after a few days and I returned them on their dime, no less!\nThese guys are the bomb! I might even pay a little more occasionally, but I will probably never order anything for my Mercedes Panzer-wagen again without talking to these folks first. These guys lost money on my order just to make it right. They're standin' tall in my book!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:38:48.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

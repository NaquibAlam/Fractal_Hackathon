From small dual core AMD servers to big HP servers with two 6 cores E5 XEON CPU's.\nYou also can configure the server yourself and have fully customized server. I need to point, in this case, the price is bit higher than similar pre-configured server.\nEvery server can be with SATA disk or SSD, so you can choose between blazing speed or lots of storage - tried both and currently have server with 2 TB SSD space and another with 12 TB space.\nYou can also choose between several Linux distributions. I personally use CentOS 7. They also include old Linux versions such CentOS 5 or CentOS 6 if you are stuck with it for some reason. Ms Windows is also supported.\nEven you choose custom configured server, usually it is available in 2-3 hours.\nServers can be in USA or Germany. Both networks are fast and reliable. For most servers, you can get up to 4 IP addresses, but for some servers you can get more. This is something you need to check before order.\nTechnical support is OK. I used it several times and response is promptly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:38:19.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

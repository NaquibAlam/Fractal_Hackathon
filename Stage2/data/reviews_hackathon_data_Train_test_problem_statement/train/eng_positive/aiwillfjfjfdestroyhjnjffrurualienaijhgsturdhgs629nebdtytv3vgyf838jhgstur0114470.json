The products have always been as-described (mostly electronics and rc drone parts and tools) and of good quality for my needs.\nOnly once (out of maybe 10 orders now) did an order arrive with an incorrect item. And I was a little concerned because a $35 item had arrived when I had ordered a $200+ item!! Yikes!\nBUT, they quickly corrected the issue, sent a new original item as a replacement, and even let me keep the incorrect item, which was something I could use anyway. It only took a few email exchanges and a few days, due to the time differences between China and US. I thought the service was quite good.\nI would recommend them highly, and have always had good experiences.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T18:58:36.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

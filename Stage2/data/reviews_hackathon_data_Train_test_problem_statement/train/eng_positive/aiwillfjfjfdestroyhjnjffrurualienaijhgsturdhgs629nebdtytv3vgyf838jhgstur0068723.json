To be sure I had the part number correct, I used the Parts Town 'chat' feature; easy and quick response. They assured me it was the correct part (based on the information I was given by the manufacturer), so I ordered it. The delivery was made right on time; I was notified, just as I had requested. It all worked out wonderfully, until I learned that the manufacturer had given me the wrong information concerning the part. Now I had to return it. I know this can be a nightmare sometimes, but the rep. at Parts Town responded quickly to my inquiry and the return and credit back process came off without a hitch. Couldn't have had a better experience from a company I was unfamiliar with. I would highly recommend them!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T13:41:47.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I went into to their showroom in La Habra so i could actually sit in the theater seats to see which ones were the most comfortable . As soon as we were buzzed in we were greeted by a sales rep named John Jasso. John showed us around and answered all of questions until we finally found the seats we wanted. As a salesman myself, I always look to the rep to point me in the right direction and John did just that. We bought 4 chairs to start and will keep coming back as we add onto our media room. John provided exceptional customer service and we are very happy with the products we bought.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:35:33.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

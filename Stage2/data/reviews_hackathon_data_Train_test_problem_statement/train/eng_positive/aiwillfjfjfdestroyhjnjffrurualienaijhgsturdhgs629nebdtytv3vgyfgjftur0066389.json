The only issue I have is that no one in the beekeeping business seams to know how to use a tape measure. 19 7/8 by 14 are the standard outside measurements for a langstroth garden 8 frame with 3/4 wooden-ware, not 19 3/4 by 13 3/4. Both the slatted rack and queen excluder are misfit with my existing equipment. Other than that they are assembled well with quality materials. I guess if I want them to fit properly I will have to make a few boxes too their size. Don't worry, no matter what I buy or from whom I purchase it, it's very rarely the right dimensions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:55:24.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

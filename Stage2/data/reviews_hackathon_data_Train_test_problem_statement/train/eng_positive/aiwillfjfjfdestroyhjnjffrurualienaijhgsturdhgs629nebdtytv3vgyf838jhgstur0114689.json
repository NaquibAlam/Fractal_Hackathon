I have seen other options on etradesupply or other website for oem replacement and they charging too much for shipping from states and reviews were not really good for their replacement, so then i decided to order from screen country since they ship from canada n reviews were great. So i crossed my fingers n ordered the screen and i m really happy with the outcome.\nFirst of all shipping was fast, secondly the screen is working like oem n thirdly there customer support is really nice n responsive. So I would definitely recommend to u if u thinking of replacing ur iphone 6 screen urself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T17:27:54.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

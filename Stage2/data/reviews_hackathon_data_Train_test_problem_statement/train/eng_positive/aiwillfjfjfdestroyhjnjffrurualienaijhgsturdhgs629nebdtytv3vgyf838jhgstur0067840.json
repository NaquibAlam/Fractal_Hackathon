These sets were installed and out of our shop within a week.\nWe were also impressed with quality and ease of installation. I put a short commercial on the JJ's Cycle facebook page showing how they worked and within one day I had to order 3 more sets.\nI'm looking forward to a very active relationship with XKGlow products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T15:31:02.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

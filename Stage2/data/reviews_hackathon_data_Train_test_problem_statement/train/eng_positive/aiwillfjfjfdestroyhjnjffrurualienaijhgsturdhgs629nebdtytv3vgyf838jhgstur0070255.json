They do a great job of making sure you get a good deal and listen to your concerns.\nI ordered a set of TOYO Versado's on Monday for an install on Tuesday but due to the snow events lately they did not come in until today. The price shown for the Noir's was about $100/ ea. Great price and a great tire.\nNothing like driving on a new set of tires!\nThank you TFT\nJohn M.\n2006 Accord EX-L", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:26:04.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

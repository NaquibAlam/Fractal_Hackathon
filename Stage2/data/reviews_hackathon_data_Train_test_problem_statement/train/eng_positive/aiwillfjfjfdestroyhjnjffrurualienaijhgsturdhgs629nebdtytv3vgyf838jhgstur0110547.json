You just can't walk into a Wal-mart and get these. I had been looking for these particular flags for several years.

I even caught a few people giving a thumbs up sign.\nFrom now on, I'll always check with American Flags first.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:46:43.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Then there was the 2 guys who did not want to see the Jayco, they just wanted to negotiate on price, as a cash purchaser. I assume they were some kind of wholesaler wanting something for nothing. After two weeks of this kind of caller, I began talking to real people who wanted to see my Jayco. The second couple who looked at it, bought it on the spot. They are great people from out of town and I know they will have great fun with this camper. I have read articles before about what to expect at first and they were correct. The bottom line is that RVT has serious, qualified lookers and if wait and you work with them, they will look and they will buy. Thank you RVT!

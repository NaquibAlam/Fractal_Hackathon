I found the book on Amazon for $142 and thought I was lucky since her schools bookstore was selling it for $192. I found it on Biblio.com for $70.75. I know this sounds too good to be true but it wasn't. It was the exact book we needed for half the price. I will shop for all my my college kids books here from now on!!

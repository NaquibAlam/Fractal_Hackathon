The special blend of food they make and deliver to my pet suits his sensitive stomach. He was really struggling to keep anything down and I tried all sorts of different brands and nothing seemed to suit him at all. I discovered tails.com through researching for food specially formulated for dogs with digestion problems and filled in his details. I'm so glad I did. Maximus took to the food straight away which was a relief after trying most of the brands you can get on the high street and is now at a healthy weight and doing really well. I don't feed him anything else and all of his treats are also made by tails.com. Would highly recommend this company and its products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:23:26.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

First person I spoke with on the phone (I unfortunately did not write her name down!) asked what I needed to accomplish, she recognized right away another department would be better suited for my needs, right away got me to someone and that gentleman (Eric) guided me very quickly through setting up a new account. After hanging up with him, I needed to switch the main email for the account, and couldn't because I had already used that one in my initial attempt to set up a free trial. I was assisted by a Chat representative, Tierra, and she had no problem deactivating that account so I could switch it over for my boss.\nTruly appreciated the efficiency to make this process easy. We're actually attempting to fill MY position as I'm relocating out of state, so I'm on ZipRecruiter as a job seeker as well and I'm very happy to know the wheels behind the scenes are running smoothly for everyone!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:24:10.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They don't \"belong\" to anyone so they can do the right thing by steering the hapless caller to the best possible solution. They are unfailingly polite, patient and, thank goodness, have a sense of humor.\nPEOPLE, it's a MINEFIELD out there! Get some help making these important healthcare decisions. And, thankfully, you can always call the good folks at Select Quote: and shop around for something better.\nFor some reason, Blue Cross and Blue Shield aren't part of Select Quote: .\nKeep up the great work, guys and gals!!\nAnd MANY THANKS.\nTHUMBS UP üëç and FIVE STARS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:50:42.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

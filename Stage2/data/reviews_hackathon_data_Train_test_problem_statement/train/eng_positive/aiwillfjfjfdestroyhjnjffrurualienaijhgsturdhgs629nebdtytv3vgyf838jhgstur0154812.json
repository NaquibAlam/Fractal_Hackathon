Was just fantastic!!!! My wife and I were just getting irritated with the time it was taking to complete the process and luz kept talking to us to keep us busy and she quietly took off in my car and filled the tank with gas and got my wife and I both drinks. I was just delighted beyond all means with her. She is a keeper !!!! Not that any one person wasn't doing what they could to speed it up just she went above and beyond... thank you for the experience luz.

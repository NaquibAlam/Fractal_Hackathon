There had been a few times when some of the quality of items weren't of standard and they've compensated and made sure that I was happy with my purchases. For example, this order I had a BB cushion and when it arrived, the product was dried up and the BB cream that I did get out of it was oily and oddly colored. I sent an email to their customer service and they were prompt in their reply and offered to send me a replacement cushion at no cost to me. I did not have to send back the old one, instead just send them a picture of the defective product. I do not blame them one bit for the cushion being dry, the product was not expired and probably didn't have much to start in it. As far as the rest of my order, everything was well priced and came in good condition. The sizing for 2 of my items were a little off and as a result I had to return those even though they were of great quality. Shipping was fast for me as everything was marked \"Ships within 24 hours\" and I was eligible for free express shipping. I also never forget to get the \"Free Item of the Day\"; it is a great add to the site. Overall, I'm really pleased to be a customer of YesStyle and have recommended it to many of my friends, all of whom have also made purchases on this site. Out of all the sites I go shopping on, YesStyle is probably one of my top favorites. Thank you for making my shopping experience wonderful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:21:45.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Our wedding is in June and the pressure was getting to much! Not to mention the worry and feeling anxious that my grandad won't be here to give me away, it's basically now or never. So knowing my credit isn't the best I just hit a wall and thought this was the end! Until I came across amigo loans! After having a chat with my sister who wanted the wedding to go ahead as much as me she very kindly agreed to stand my guarantor! I only applied Saturday evening Tuesday Â£4000 cleared into my account! So a massive massive thank you! You've not only helped my dreams come true but given my family hope and something very good to look forward to!

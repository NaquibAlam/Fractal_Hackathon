I experienced someone rear ending me on a freeway to water damage in my home. The service I received in the two situations was wonderful. In both instances they were concerned with my safety first. They gave me the names, numbers, and addresses ( which were close to home)of who to contact for repairs. The individual was professional, caring and knowledgeable.

Excellent service all away around!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:00:10.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

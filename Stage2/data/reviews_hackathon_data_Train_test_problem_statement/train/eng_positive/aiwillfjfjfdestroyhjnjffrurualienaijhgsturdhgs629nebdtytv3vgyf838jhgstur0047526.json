This is a new edition but is very annoying and useless is the last time I buy a connect. Difficult too comeback and read the material after doing the online quiz. Totally a nightmare and a useless way of spending money. The publisher should have given a cheap paper book to read at home with the connect, which is to use for one semester. To solve this issue searched online for a very inexpensive book. Until I found your book online for a great price less than $ 5. dollars. It is an older edition but is useful to read and memorize certain definitions that never change. History of Finance changes as new elements come to be in the financial world, such as the crash of 2008, which is not in your book but can go back to connect and see the differences. I am very great-full to your E Bay price purchase because in Amazons do have a store card so had not paid the connect yet, but have charge it on my account. I am looking forward to see what else you may have on store for other classes. To study is expensive and I do not have a job, money, financial aid or any help from any kind of scholarships. So I am very glad about people like yourself that sells a great product for a very reasonable price, almost a gift. An old edition is a great way to study the same material. Thank You so much for your help...You are great!!!\nSincerely,\nLiliana Prina", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T11:28:54.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

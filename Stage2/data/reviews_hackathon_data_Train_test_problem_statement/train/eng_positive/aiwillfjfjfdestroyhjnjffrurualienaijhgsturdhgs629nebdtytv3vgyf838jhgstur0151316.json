When they arrived, it turned out I didn't know my correct ring size, but PrimeStyle was more than happy to organise to have my rings resized at a fraction of the cost of having it done at my local jewellers. All the staff that I dealt with were so helpful and friendly and it was very reassuring to receive updates letting us know the progress of our purchase. We are so happy with the rings and I have even received comments about them from staff at jewellery stores regarding how unique and gorgeous they are. Would definitely use\nPrimeStyle again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:13:18.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

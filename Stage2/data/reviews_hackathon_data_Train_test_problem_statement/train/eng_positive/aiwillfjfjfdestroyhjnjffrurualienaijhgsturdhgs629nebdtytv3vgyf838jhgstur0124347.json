I was way too early, though ordering trees I'm sure they had plenty of time to grow in a healthy environment before coming to me as a result. The order status check on the web site never worked for me, but my email inquiries were answered pretty quickly. The trees arrived and looked great. I had space to keep inside while the weather is still volatile so requesting an early (relative to what it would have been ) shipment worked out for me, but without that I'm sure the wait would have been even longer. I do see very good reason for payment up front as it is a big investment sometimes to actually grow the product, but it would be nice to have tracking or email updates in the order to not charge your credit card then have to just hope things are proceeding as expected. Since this was my first experience with the company a part of me was worried with what ifs when the web status check didn't work. After delivery- well worth the wait and I'm looking forward to getting them planted and growing. I'm hoping they stay as healthy as they look on arrival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:23:14.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

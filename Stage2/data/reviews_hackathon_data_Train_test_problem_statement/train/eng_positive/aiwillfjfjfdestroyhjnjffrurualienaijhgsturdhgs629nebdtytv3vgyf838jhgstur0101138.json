The booking process was easy and the documents came in a lovely little Travel Wallet (you just don't see service like this anymore)!\nThe trip all flowed so well. There was always someone waiting exactly when and where they said they would be and all ran without a hiccup.\nWe spent most of our trip in Hoedspruit. Highlights for me were Camp Jubulani, this is 5 star luxury! The attention to detail at this place makes for such a wonderful stay. The Rangers, the Chef and all staff to be commended.\nThe Thonybush reserve and collection is another I would highly recommend. The difference between having a tracker and a guide at the reserve was definitely something that made the experience just that little bit more special. The passion of the tracker and guide shone through seeing all the big 5 within 24 hours. We stayed at Shambalala and the Main Lodge here and would recommend without hesitation.\nCannot speak highly enough of service levels from start to finish and the quality of the accommodation and transfers. I will be using Bench for any future trips to Africa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:23:41.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

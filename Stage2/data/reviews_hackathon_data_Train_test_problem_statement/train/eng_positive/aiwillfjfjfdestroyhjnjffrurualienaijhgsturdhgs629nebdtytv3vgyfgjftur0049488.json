New designs all the time!\n2. Great quality! I've bought items for $12.00-$20.00 at retail stores, but none have compared to the quality of Fabletics. They keep everything in place while I run, from head to toe so to speak. Fits great! And sweat resistant!\n3. The only downfall is that credit does not last long! You cannot let it add up over years because the credit only lasts a year :(\n4. On one hand, you have to continually skip, every month, otherwise you'll be charged. On the other hand, once you are charged, you just have to use the money, therefore you may often check the website and use the money you were charged to buy something of your liking.\n5.

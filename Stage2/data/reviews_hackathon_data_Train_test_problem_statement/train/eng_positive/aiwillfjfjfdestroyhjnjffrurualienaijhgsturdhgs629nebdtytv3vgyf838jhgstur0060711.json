I have very thin, fine hair that just sweeps the top of my shoulders. I have worn hair pieces and wigs in the past, but styling is limited, they are also uncomfortable. Because my hair is so fine and thin, permanent extensions can be damaging and are not an option. After some research and reviews for clip-in extensions I came across Luxy. I had a lot of questions and the Luxy consultant was wonderful! I sent her a photo of my hair taken in it's natural state and natural light. She emailed me back and recommended that I purchase the 160g in Dark Brown. My hair arrived about 3 business days later. I could not believe how beautiful the hair was. The look and the colour was that of natural hair. The strands from top to bottom were in excellent shape. My best friend, also my stylist, could not get over how beautiful they were. We took them into the professional cosmetology store and the workers, also licensed cosmetologist, were amazed with the quality and colour of the hair. My best friend and I wasted little time in snapping in my hair. For the first time in my life I had a gorgeous flowing head of hair.\nI have since tweeked the placement of my extensions, have curled, straightened, and styled them in different ways. They look as beautiful now as they did when they arrived. No shedding, no fading and no splitting. I love the way I look and the confidence I have with my Luxy hair. I highly recommend emailing a consultant with your photo to help make the best decision for colour and weight, and to answer any questions you may have. While waiting for your hair to arrive be sure to visit the Luxy YouTube channel for tutorials and care.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T17:53:13.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

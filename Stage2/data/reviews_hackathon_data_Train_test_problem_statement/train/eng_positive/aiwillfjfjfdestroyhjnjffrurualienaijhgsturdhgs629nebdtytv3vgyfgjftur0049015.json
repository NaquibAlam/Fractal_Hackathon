It looks just as we expected. I was careful about the proportions of the photo so that we would not lose anything in fitting it to the dimensions of the canvas. There's something about the canvas print that is more attractive than a glossy photo. Our print has no frame and a \"mirror\" edge, and it looks starkly simple, which we like. The mirror edge is good, for it looks like the print was folded over the edge, but nothing is taken away from the actual photo. We're happy with this canvas print, and we've ordered another print of another photo.

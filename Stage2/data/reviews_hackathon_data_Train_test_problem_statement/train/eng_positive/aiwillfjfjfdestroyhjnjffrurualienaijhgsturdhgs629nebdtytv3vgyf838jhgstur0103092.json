I drove from Queenstown to Auckland during the course of that time. The car was a small Tiida, and it's gas mileage was great and the car gave me no mechanical issues going through the mountains. The reps I dealt with in the office were also friendly.\nThe only hitch I faced was that the price I was Quote: d over e-mail ended up being different than what I paid in person. This issue was resolved (after a long e-mail exchange back and forth over the course of a few weeks) by them issuing a refund for the difference, so I'm a happy guy.\nI recommend renting from them because they did have a good price and car, just be sure to verify the Quote: to what you pay in person. My only recommendation to Omega is to attempt to resolve problems a little faster, but again overall this was a good experience and I have no major complaints.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:08:35.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

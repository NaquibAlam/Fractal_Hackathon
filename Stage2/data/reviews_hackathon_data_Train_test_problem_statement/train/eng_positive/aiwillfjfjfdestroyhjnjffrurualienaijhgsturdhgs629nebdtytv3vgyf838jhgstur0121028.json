Most of the time when I shop there it's for major purchases (i.e. furniture, major appliances, large item electronics). I feel that this is where they excel. They do a good job of screening their products and typically only have the high quality versions of anything they sell. I have had to use their warranty program before and they were very good about honoring the terms without making me run through so much red tape that it isn't worth the claim. I have also had a few things that I bought the warranty for and they didn't need it. It this case RC Willey gave me a gift card for part of the warranty price that I paid. They have regular sales that are amazing and make the value of their products even better. My only complaint or criticism is that sometimes they have higher prices than their competition, so you do need to price check before purchasing. However, that's a sound practice regardless of who you buy from.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:24:45.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

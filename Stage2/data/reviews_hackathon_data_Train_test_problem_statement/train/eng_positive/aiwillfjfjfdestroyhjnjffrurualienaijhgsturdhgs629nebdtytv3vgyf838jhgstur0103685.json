Next to the Armed Forces Career Forces Center. The customer service and his personality was so upbeat and informative that it made me want to bring other folks with me to the place. Speaking with him gave me the idea of pursuing a Personal Trainer or Nutritionist . I give this store and even the guy who had just started working there 2 thumbs up and of course 5 stars. I purchased a fat loss weight monitor for my lady who wants to try to lose weight. I also purchased a watch-like device called Polar Loop. I will be back for more products that I can use. I wish I knew about this store when I was in the Marines. This Young Black Marine Corps 7 year old Veteran is proud to have come to this store. Please keep Mr. Jay there he is awesome!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:19:06.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

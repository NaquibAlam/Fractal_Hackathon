I called them and they had me talking to a lawyer in no time. Although I felt that the payments were a bit high I had to reconsider my thoughts. Would I rather deal with the IRS on my own or get help from someone that was used to dealing with them? I paid the fee which was done in 10 installments and they got the IRS to settle with me for $200.00. I would definitely recommend Tax Tiger to anyone who has a problem with the IRS. Thanks again to Brenton Schick and all the wonderful at Tax Tiger !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:52:00.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

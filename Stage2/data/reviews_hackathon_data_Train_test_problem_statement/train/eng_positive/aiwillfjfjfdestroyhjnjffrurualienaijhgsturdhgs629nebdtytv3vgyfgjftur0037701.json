In the description it says that they have a convenient place to hold your business cards. When I received them there was no such spot. When I conducted a chat with customer service I was informed that there was a different one that had to be picked out in one of the first steps of ordering. (I have since gone back & gone through everything & can't find that place) I then asked why it was described that way without stating that it could come with or without the groove for business cards? I didn't get an answer to that only a cop out saying that they would give me 15% off a reorder. Why would I reorder & spend more money on something when it didn't come the way I expected in the first place? I don't need two name plates for each person in the office.\n**UPDATE**\nThe company contacted me & corrected the problem with the glitch on the description. They have since sent me the original desk plates that I ordered & they are great. They work perfectly for what I needed & look very professional.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T21:54:40.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

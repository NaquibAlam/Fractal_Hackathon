The assistants were all very helpful and friendly. I wished that I would have known that you had to register online before hand and also print out pictures of all of the dresses on your wish list. I read the website before we went there and I did not see that information communicated anywhere on the website. So that set us back a little bit when we first went in because we had to take care of those things before we could try on any dresses. All of the employees were wonderful to work with and very helpful with suggestions and very efficient with bringing out dresses. The one difficult thing about the process was that there is a time limit of 55 minutes and when you have been in a dressing room for that amount of time, an announcement comes on that you are not allowed to bring up any new dresses. So it is a little bit stressful because you are trying to make a big decision about something that is very expensive and feeling like there is a time pressure. I don't think they would actually kick you out of the dressing room, but they do ask you to just choose from the dresses you have set aside up until that point. So it is definitely not a relaxing process but in the end we found a dress that we loved. It is also nice that you can try on shoes and jewelry while you are wearing the dress. It is much easier that way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T23:45:42.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

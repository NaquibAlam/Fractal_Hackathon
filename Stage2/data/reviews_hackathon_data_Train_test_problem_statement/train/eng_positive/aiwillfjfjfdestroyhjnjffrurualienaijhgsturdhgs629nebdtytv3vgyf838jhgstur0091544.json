Hadn't heard of them before finding them in a Google Search for those \"1-800\" guys. Lens Direct came out cheaper and with free shipping (after a coupon code I found online). Placed order around 7PM on Monday night and my contacts arrived on Wednesday of the next week (9 days later) with the free shipping option and after my new Rx was verified. Will definitely order from Lens Direct next time! They are also a Google Trusted Store, so you can have peace of mind that your purchase is protected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:17:53.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

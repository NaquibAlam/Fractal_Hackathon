We can sometimes find one at our local Kroger but not this season. I decided to go online and order. So easy and they were looking on sale with a free gift and free shipping! My daddy was so excited when his surprise package was delivered. His local butcher sliced it for him and he sent me pictures of the beautiful center slices. He got 14 packages after eating his fill of Country ham and biscuits the day he had his ham sliced. Thank you for making him so happy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:37:07.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

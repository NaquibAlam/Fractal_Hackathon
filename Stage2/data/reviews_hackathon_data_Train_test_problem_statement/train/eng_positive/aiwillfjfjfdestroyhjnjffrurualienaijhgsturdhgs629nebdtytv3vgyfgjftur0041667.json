I had ordered parts for my Atwood stove (wires and ignition switch). When I received the parts the new wires were all one length, where the old wires were different lengths, so I was not able to complete the repairs. I received a prompt response when I contacted customer service about the wire issue. It was requested that I provide a model number for the range. The issue I had is I had to take the stove apart again to lift up the range top to gain access to the model number. I was not asked this when I ordered the parts. The model number should be easily accessible or should be requested when ordering. I also requested written instructions for the repair. I was sent an email stating I just had to remove a few screws. This was not the case. I would order again but I guess I need to be precise with what I need and I can not count on any instructions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:33:04.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

HE IS SO PROFESSIONAL AND KNOWLEDGEABLE . MY SYSTEM WAS NOT EASY, BUT HE HAD THE CODES IN HIS HEAD LIKE A COMPUTER. VERY CALM. WAS LIKE DEALING WITH A BEST FRIEND. I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT WITH THIS COMPANY THAT IF I NEED THEM THEY WILL BE THERE. READ HORROR STORIES OF OTHER COMPANIES. YOU ARE NOT LOCKING YOURSELF IN A LONG TERM CONTRACT, THAT IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY YOU ARE STUCK. BEING BILLED MONTH TO MONTH IS THE WAY TO GO. THEY ARE NOT THE LOWEST PRICE BUT NOT THE HIGHEST. ABOUT AVERAGE. READ ABOUT THAT SIX DOLLAR COMPANY WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. I FEEL I HAVE BOUGHT THE CREAM OF THE CROP. AND WHY GET THE ORDINARY WHEN YOU CAN HAVE THE EXTRAORDINARY. I CAN SLEEP GOOD. FRANK, THANKS AGAIN.\nDAVE & SANDY\nCOOPER CITY , FLORIDA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:30:06.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

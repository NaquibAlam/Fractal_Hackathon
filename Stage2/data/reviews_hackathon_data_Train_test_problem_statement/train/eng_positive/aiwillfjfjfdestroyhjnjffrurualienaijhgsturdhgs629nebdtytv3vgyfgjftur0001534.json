I was online searching for a possible solution when I came across the Pelican Shower Filter. I figured it was worth a try. After the first shower with the filter installed I was sold forever. Great product, works as described, easy to install and autoship makes it a no brainer. I have recommended this product to friends who report that the Pelican worked as well for them. Also, great customer service!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:34:56.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

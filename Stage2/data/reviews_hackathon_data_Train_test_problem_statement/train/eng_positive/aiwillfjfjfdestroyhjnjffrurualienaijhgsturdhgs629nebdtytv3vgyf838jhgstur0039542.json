I was ringing everywhere looking for one and no one could help. When I rang TK's the lady (Valerie) on the phone understood what I needed and went out of her way to make sure one was in stock in the country. The ordering was simple and 48 hours later my small toddler who had not had a good night sleep for a long time finally got some rest. I now use the humidifier every night and in future Tony Kealys will be my first place I will ring or go to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:46:10.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

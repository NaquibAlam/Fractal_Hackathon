Ordered some samples which arrived promptly and suitable packaged, unlike some from another company which took ages to arrive and were not securely packed. Went ahead and placed order - found the website easy to use. Confirmation of order and updates on order progress and dispatch we excellent. Time between order and receipt was really not very long at all! Blinds when received were well packaged, and exactly as we expected. Can't say how Blinds2go are when there is a problem - that is always one test of good service in my experience. But based on our experience so far, we would not hesitate in ordering our next set of blinds from them. Oh and PS - we did survey prices elsewhere and there really wasn't anything much in it, and some were a lot more expensive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:04:30.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

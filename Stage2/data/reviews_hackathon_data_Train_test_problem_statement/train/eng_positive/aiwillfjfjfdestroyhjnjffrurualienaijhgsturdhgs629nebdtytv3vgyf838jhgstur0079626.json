On line, big box stores, even considered making new cabinets myself. I could not beat Cabinet Giant for price or quality anywhere. All solid wood or REAL plywood (not furniture board, particle board, or even cardboard), very nice door hinges and drawer slides (soft close, adjustable), and delivered to my home. I used some glue with the assembly, but clearly didn't have to with very good fit (tight dados, solid metal clips; you will need a rubber mallet). We had one cabinet with damage; followed instructions on the website and Cabinet Giant replaced the entire cabinet within just a few days. If I bought this level of quality locally, I would have paid double maybe more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T12:44:09.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

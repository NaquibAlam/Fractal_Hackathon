The ship was perfect and the crew was friendly, kind, and helpful. I did choose the D deck due to worry about motion sickness but I was fine. Due to the steep stairs down to D, I wish had gone with C deck. The engine and anchor noise was loud. The food was wonderful though a lot of fish and chicken but it was well prepared with varied side dishes. The shrimp ceviche was amazing! The hikes were challenging for sure and the snorkeling was wonderful. We did not snorkel at Los Lobos though it said that we would. They let the Grace snorkel there that day. I was disappointed as the first snorkel elsewhere was rough with changing current. Other snorkels were great. We saw 3 kinds of sharks and 3 kinds of rays on one day. Our naturalists were very knowledgeable about everything. One naturalist, Roberto, was a little more patient with the older folks. Alex, the other naturalists was very knowledgeable about topics. Panga drivers and other helpers were very good to help get you into/onto the panga. It can be tricky. Arrangements were good and flights were fine. Unfortunately there was one child on this trip that was annoying and ii-mannered. The guides tried to keep him on track as his parents were not doing that. There was only one child so his parents should have tried to find a trip that was more suitable for children. He had to have special food at dinner which was ridiculous. They let him get in front of people and wave sticks around and bang on everything in sight. Not Quasar's fault but maybe warn parents that NO special considerations will be given or something. Met lots of nice people other than that family. I highly recommend this trip and this ship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:42:59.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

John Nelson at Instant Tax Solutions assured me that they were a legitimate business.\nWith that being said, I took a leap of faith and did business with them.\nChristine Hill worked on my account. This woman is awesome at what she does. Christine worked very hard to get things done for me and my husband. She went above and beyond, I know that she really put in some long hours working with the IRS on our behalf. The end result proves it.\nShe was very attentive, she made me feel like I was her only concern. How many times can anyone say that ? Lol now a days, people are very rude and don't seem to give a dam. Not Christine, at times when I was feeling frustrated, she'd take time to let me vent and told me that she was there for me if I ever just needed to talk.\nThis company was true to their word, I paid their fee and was still treated very well. Unlike most companies who just want the money and once it's paid, you're no longer any use to them. So, if you are wondering if you should use Instant Tax Solutions to help you to deal with the IRS, please, do not hesitate to call them. You will be glad that you did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:53:22.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

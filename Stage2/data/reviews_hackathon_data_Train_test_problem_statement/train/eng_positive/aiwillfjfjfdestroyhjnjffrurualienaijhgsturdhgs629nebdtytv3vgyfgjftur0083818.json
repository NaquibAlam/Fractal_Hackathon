Unfortunately after I already picked the date to have Chocolates and Flowers sent to her, she was asked last minute to travel to another Country for her job. Flowers and chocolates arrived on time. Their was a misunderstanding between me, my special someone and coworker communicating though each other through 3 different countries, to where I thought the chocolates never arrived. However ZChocolat responded fast to my emails and jumped through hoops, contacting the delivery company and than back to me to figure out the problem. Like I said above, there was no problem everything did arrive smoothly and on time and it was misunderstanding on my end but ZChocolat couldn't have handled it any better. Seems like they are ran by good people", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:44:48.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

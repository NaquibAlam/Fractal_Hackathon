I was dissapointed to discover though that the insurance I purchased online when I booked the car was provided by a different company. In the event of an accident I would have been charged an excess by redspot, I would then have had to chase the insurer for reimbursement. Confusing, unclear and misleading. Better to get insurance through redspot when you pick up the car then it's all bundled together and you wont pay excess in the event of an accident. Apart from this I was happy with the service provided.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T23:46:08.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

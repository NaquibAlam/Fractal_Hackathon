Spoke with a very polite woman who took my information that ensured my Fed Ex delivery three days later (including a snow storm day!). I got that \"small company\" feel from the ladies in customer service! They were terrific and I'm thrilled with my perfect frame! I'll be buying from this company again AND recommending them to others without reservation! Thanks, White Mountain!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:09:04.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

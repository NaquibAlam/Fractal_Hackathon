We were picked up in Belfast and ended our tour in Dublin. Mark our driver was very knowledgeable and accommodating. The days were full but not overloaded and had enough down time. We stayed in a variety of accommodations. Guest houses, hotels, and a castle stay which were all lovely. Would highly recommend them for your Ireland adventure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:48:54.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

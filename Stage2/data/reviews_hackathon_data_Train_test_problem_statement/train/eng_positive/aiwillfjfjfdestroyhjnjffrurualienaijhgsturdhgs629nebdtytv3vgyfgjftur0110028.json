I was so impressed with the professionalism and knowledge of my sales rep, Sarah Buss. After giving her the measurements of our current projector set-up (screen size, distance, etc) she pointed me to a perfect replacement. She gave me her honest opinion on a good machine. She told me about other machines that would have cost more money but then explained why they weren't best for what we needed after speaking about our worship area. After deciding I was ready to purchase, she quickly got everything taken care of so we could get the system overnighted for our Sunday morning worship service!\nI never once felt like I was being \"sold\" something. She spoke like a consultant and I have no doubt that taking care of our needs were her top priority!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T10:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:49:49.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

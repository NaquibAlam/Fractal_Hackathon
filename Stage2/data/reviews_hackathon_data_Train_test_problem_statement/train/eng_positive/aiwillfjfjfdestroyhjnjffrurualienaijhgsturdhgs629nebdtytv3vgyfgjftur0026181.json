The handyman service did a creditable job on our bathroom project. My husband wasn't satisfied with the painting, but the handyman service let him paint over a long weekend before they came back to finish the job. He was very grateful for that. The general contractor still has our project in the works and has submitted plans to the Bldg Dept., so, that opinion is still out. We asked for an electrician for our elderly neighbor and she was very satisfied with his work and would hire him again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T19:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:58:26.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

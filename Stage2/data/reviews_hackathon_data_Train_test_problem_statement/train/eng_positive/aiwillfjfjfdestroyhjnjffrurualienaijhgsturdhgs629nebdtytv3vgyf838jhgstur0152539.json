With the help of Costa Rican vacations, we had a worry-free, amazing time. From the 1st phone contact, to the confirming of plans, to the trip, everything went so smoothly. We are 70 years young & wanted to do some adventure (ziplining, volcano hike, river rafting, catamaran cruise), as well as relax. Our consultant Rebecca Anderson made it all happen. All of our drivers, guides, & hotel staff were so friendly. Hotels were beautiful, food delicious, adventures well run & exciting. We felt so secure & pampered. Everything was taken care of for us, and we never had a worry about where to be when, yet were on a private vacation, not with a tour group. We were amazed at the price. So much less than if we had tried to book everything on our own. We had private transportation everywhere, giving us a chance to interact with local drivers. We met so many fun people, learned so much about the beautiful country, and had the trip of our dreams. Thank You for making our Anniversary Vacation Amazing. We highly recommend Costa Rican Vacations to anyone wanting a great trip planned for them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:52:06.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

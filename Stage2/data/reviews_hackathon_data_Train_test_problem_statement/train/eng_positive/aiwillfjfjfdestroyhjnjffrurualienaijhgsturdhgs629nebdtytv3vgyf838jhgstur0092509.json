I have been seeing ASAP ticket commercial on TFC, I'm a little bit skeptic with the company. I decided to give it a try and make a call, Magnolia was the agent who took my call, and all I can say is that, I have never been so satisfied with her professionalism, knowledge and caring attitude. She did not only took interest of satisfying our demands but also has a lot of patience and concern acknowledging the time difference between Los Angeles Ca. and Philippines. she follows up with me and took all effort in assisting me in reserving our seat request. Magnolia is a gem and asset to your company. make sure that you take care of her to keep her. very efficient in her job! Kudos to Magnolia, Cheers to your company. good job. far better customer service than Expedia. keep up the good work!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:36:55.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

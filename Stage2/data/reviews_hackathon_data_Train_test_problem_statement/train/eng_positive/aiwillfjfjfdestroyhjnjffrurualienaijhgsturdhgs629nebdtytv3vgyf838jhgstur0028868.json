The wax is to be used to paint on as starter strip for foundationless frames. The queen excluder is curiously shaped, and the outside frame edges are rounded, that will pose a water problem for the lower box, also it is only in a 1/2 inch deep wooden frame the dimensions were 19 15/16 by 13 5/8 by 1/2 , so it won't fit properly on my equipment but I will more than likely just modify it and hope it works out okay.

Our hosts, David and Wendy, made every accommodation for us so that we were well prepared to take care of their home and their beloved dogs, Jake and Umbro. Being members of Trusted Housesitters enables us to travel in a new way without hotels, and the bonus is that we gain the privilege of becoming friends with the most lovable dogs AND their masters.\nWe are delighted that we took the plunge and joined the organization. Doors have opened to us with new vistas and possibilities for travel and cultural immersion. This is a unique and wonderful way to broaden our horizons and make new friends at home and abroad. We give the experience 5 Stars!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T13:18:34.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

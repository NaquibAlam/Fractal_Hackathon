All of us eat better because of it. Working full-time and trying to come up with a healthy dinner every night is tough. It requires planning, trips to the store, food prep, clean up and creativity in coming up with different and tasty meals. Munchery does all of that for you. The food is delicious and you can order same day. You can order meals that are ready to eat or meals that require a little prep if you enjoy being in the kitchen. We love the variety and getting to pick from a varied menu every night. I can't imagine going back to regular cooking. My family eats better because of Munchery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T14:22:10.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

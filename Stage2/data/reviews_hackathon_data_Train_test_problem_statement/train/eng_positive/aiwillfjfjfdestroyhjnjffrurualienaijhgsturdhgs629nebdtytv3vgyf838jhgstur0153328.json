Much better than wearing goggles over my glasses. The entire order was done online without speaking to a customer service rep. I faxed the Rx from my eye doctor after ordering the Smith goggles and a few days later a great package arrived with a solid case and my new goggles with Rx insert. A few days later I was skiing in Colorado, able to see much better than I have in years, Should have ordered years ago. Great product and customer experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:27:22.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Its website is easy to use; prices are excellent (competitive with other online bicycling sites); its VIP Club refund of 10% of the price of your purchases reduces the prices even further; shipping is fast (free for orders > $50); and the one time I did experience a problem, they were easy to work with. I have used other major online bicycling sites for items that BileTiresDirect does not carry, and the other sites are also good. However, I tend to be loyal to companies that consistently provide excellent prices and services--and BikeTiresDirect does.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T13:39:40.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I started up again Alvin Tomattis was excellent. With a clear explanation of steps to take, I had my passport sent out and returned within two weeks. I now await my passport card which he said would take a couple of weeks more. I was certainly skeptical sending my passport out but the procedure they use with FedEx helped ease my mind. Additionally, constant email updates were great. Thank you Rushmypassport.com and Alvin.

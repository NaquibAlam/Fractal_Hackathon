There are a few things. One if the article I received via email. Some of them were very helpful, but when I went to find them on the site, I couldn't figure out how. Also the vendor search needs to be more specific. For instance, if you want to search for mens' wear you have to go through what seems like the wedding dress tab. I think there should be a separate tab. You should also be able to search separately for sites that do both ceremony and reception, just ceremony, or just reception. The vendor information needs to be more up to date. I found several vendors who were no longer in business. If they aren't paying members (I know vendors pay to be on WW) then please put that somewhere with the caveat that the information isn't up to date. I didn't just use WW for vendor search, so I didn't waste my time with those out of business vendors (a quick Yelp search solved that).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:00:06.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

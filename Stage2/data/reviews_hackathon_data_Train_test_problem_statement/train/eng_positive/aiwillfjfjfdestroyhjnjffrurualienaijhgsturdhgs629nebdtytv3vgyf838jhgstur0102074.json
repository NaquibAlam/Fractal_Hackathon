I had seen their YouTube channel/videos a few years ago and always loved the videos and tutorials. I ordered the Mocha Brown Luxies in 220g. I recently cut my hair shorter, and had no problem blending my luxies! My hair isn't naturally straight, so I only wear my luxies a few times a month and am saving them for my 21st birthday in a few weeks! I can't wait to see how they look curled! The shipping was so quick (although I paid for 2-day shipping). These luxies are almost exactly like my natural hair color, and they look super natural on me. They're super comfortable to wear, so soft (I always brush them) and they don't tangle up on me at all. I love my luxies!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T09:25:24.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Having never placed my belongings into storage before, I was somewhat trepidatious about the undertaking. The Taxibox team could not have made the experience (from the first booking to the final drop-off) any more seamless or pleasing. All staff members (and I spoke to quite a number over the seven months, both on the phone and in person) were very friendly, helpful, and treated all questio ns seriously - even the ones I was pretty sure were the 'stupid ones'.\nI only once had to access my Taxibox during its' time in storage, shortly before it was re-delivered. This was required at very short notice, and I was given plenty of time and access space.\nPerhaps my highest praise would go to the re-delivery: my new home had limited parking available, making the drop-off tricky. Despite this, the team went to enormous lengths to work through the issue with me at a time when I was otherwise very busy with other aspects of the move. Their patience and flexibility made the re-delivery easily the most seamless part of my most recent house move, which did not go unappreciated.\nI was also pleasantly surprised to learn there would be no re-delivery charge, as I had stored for longer than six months. No complaint there. The overall cost of the storage was very reasonable and affordable.\nI will be using Taxibox for my next storage endeavour and began recommending it to friends months before my storage had even concluded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T04:53:14.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

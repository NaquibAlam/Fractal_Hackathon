I am so glad I called and spoke to him as I was ordering the wrong chair and he guided me in the right direction!! After hearing what I wanted he immediately hooked me up and believe it or not the whole process took less than appx 5 minutes!! Alex was so professional yet laid back and patient with my questions! He has also promised to follow through with me as soon as my chairs arrive! Like I said, I'm so glad I called!! Good job Alex, I look forward to getting my new awesome chairs!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:09:00.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

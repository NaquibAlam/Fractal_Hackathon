Totally Wicked not only provides excellent products, and some of the best customer service I've ever received from ANY company, but they keep their customer base updated on the laws and changes being made throughout the industry.\nI typically call in my orders. I speak with Angela most times and this last call with Shelby. They always take their time to ensure I am 100% happy with my purchase, and I never feel rushed to get to the next customer.\nI've purchased several different devices from Totally wicked. Although I have many \"mom n pop\" vapor stores in my area in NW Arkansas, I would rather wait the mail time and spend the same or less money, to get the quality that I can count on from them.\n10/10!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:53:42.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

For example, an outfit that I could've ordered for $59.95 I ended up paying $84.85 simply because I wanted the Capri tights instead of the full-length tights. That was the only difference! I don't have a problem with you advertising an \"outfit\" but I think you should allow VIPs to choose the length of the tights they wish to order. This really is disappointing - and I'm sure the majority of your VIPs would feel the same.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T13:29:31.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

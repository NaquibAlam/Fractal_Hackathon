Would help somewhat when choosing color. Otherwise the ordering process was easy. I couldn't give it a 5 until I actually get my order. Excited hope I'm not let down.\nUPDATE: I never received my order. I ordered 3 different styles. A couple of weeks after I ordered, I got an email saying my order was on back order with no delivery date. After another 2 weeks. I sent them an email canceling the order. Now I am waiting on my refund. S disappointed !!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T15:00:05.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

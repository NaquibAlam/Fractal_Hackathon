Satellite would not offer sufficient speed and DSL was not even an option. So, I was left with cellular service from a national carrier to access the intranet. Prior to the WeBoost, data speed was below average and constantly fluctuated to the extremes. I did a preliminary install over the weekend and immediately dropped my -100+ db to -81db. Speed test using my cell phone showed 16 down and 8 up. In addition, the house has a metal roof and my improved speed was consistent throughout the 1700 sq. ft. I work from home so I am thrilled with the results. I will be keeping the unit and permanently placing my WeBoost antenna on a pole. While researching my options, I found the WeBoost customer service very helpful with answering my questions and concerns. I called them at least three times before making my decision. The unit arrived in great condition with all the components and parts. The directions for the install could not have been simpler to follow. The only draw back was the length of the antenna cable. Thirty ft. came with the unit but I am guessing that like me, most people could use at least 50 ft. Although the unit is a little pricey I think it was worth every penny!\nChris\nWV", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T16:56:47.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

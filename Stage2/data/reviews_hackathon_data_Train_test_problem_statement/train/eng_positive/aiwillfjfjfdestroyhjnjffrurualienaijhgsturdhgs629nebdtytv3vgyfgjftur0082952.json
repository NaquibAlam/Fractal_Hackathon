They have a big range of gear. I've always found the products I've bought to be decent quality and priced very well. If i had to nit pick on something.... I bought 2 olympic bars and on one of them the knurling was a bit uneven and messy in a couple of spots. Not a deal breaker but it means being a little more careful where you put your hands! and having said that, the other bar was perfect! I've always picked my orders up so i have no comment on their delivery service!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:26:51.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

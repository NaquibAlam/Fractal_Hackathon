I decided to order fondant from Brushy Mountain (same place where we buy our woodenware and have been very impressed). I was worried it would be a while before we received the fondant. I know the hive would be ok for a bit, but with the very warm weather, they were flying and using up their stores quickly. And we still have 8 weeks of winter. The fondant arrived well before I expected. Happy beek. Happy bees. :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T23:32:53.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Shipping was free and fast. The bike came without delay and was exactly as described. I had a question about the seat post size and called Erik's for help. Like me, they could not find anything online regarding the size. The employee took my name and contacted the warehouse to have someone physically measure the post from a like bike. They called me back within 30 minutes with the results. This customer service is appreciated!! I will look at Erik's for all my bike needs in the Future!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:02:48.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

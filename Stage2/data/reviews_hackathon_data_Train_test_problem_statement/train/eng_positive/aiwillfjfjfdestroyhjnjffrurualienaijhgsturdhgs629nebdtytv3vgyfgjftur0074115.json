We agreed a set rate we pay off every month as a level pay scheme and it takes the surprise out of our bills. Would like to be able to submit our meter readings more often online but there's only a one day window per month to do that which isn't flexible enough for us. It can be done by phone but I'm more inclined to look after these things after business hours. We have seen our bills decrease in the year with energia and should they have a competitive price when our 12 month contract is up we will stick with them. We also recently had our heating break down and unfortunately it took a week before we could get someone out to look at it (6 in the house and no heating during a very cold week in February) for him only to diagnose the issue and disable the water heating \"for safety reasons\" (which we have since been told wasn't necessary) and the Quote: to fix the problem was about â‚¬100 more than a local contractor did for us. While the serviceman and the phone staff were very pleasant to deal with and obliging, the speed of service and pricing could be improved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T12:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T12:36:00.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

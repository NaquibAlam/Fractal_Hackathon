I've chosen the free shipping and mailed the customer service about the order confirmation. Since my first mail I was in touch with Lindy who was talking care of my \"case\". In a nutshell, my first item was lost during the delivery ( therefore, I don't recommend the free shipping option), Lindy proposed to send another one before the investigation with the post office will be finished. I got the second one within few days. Eventually, the first package reached also my address with a bit of a delay ( 5 weeks after the purchase). I've been offered to keep both of the items to compensate the delivery story. To sum up, despite the problems encountered during the delivery I am still very satisfied with the quality of the service. Thank you Lindy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T16:12:14.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

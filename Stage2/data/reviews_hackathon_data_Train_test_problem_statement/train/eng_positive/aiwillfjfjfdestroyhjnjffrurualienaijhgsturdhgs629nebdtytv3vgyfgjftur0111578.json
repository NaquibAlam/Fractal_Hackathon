Many times, people come in donating unopened, new bags of food. A lot of the time, you see chewy.com on the boxes. The donors go on to explain that they 1) ordered the wrong food ro 2) they are on auto-ship and dog no longer likes that particular brand; or dog passed away 3) etc., etc. They then tell us chewy.com tells them that rather than return the unopened bag, to donate to their local animal shelter....and customer still gets a refund!! Thank you!!! Our pet food pantry is now more full than empty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:14:52.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

From planning the trip through getting us to the airport for the return trip, everything was very professionally handled. All things promised were provided. Local agents were on-time, friendly and very knowledgeable. They provided their insites and expertise which made the trip more enjoyable and resulted in additional excursions. In a few instances (Example: lost phone on plan, missed pickup for a tour) the assigned agent stepped right up by ensuring we spoke with the proper airline representative to locate the iphone, and picked us up and conducted the tour on their own time.\nI will recommend Goway Travel to my friends and associates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:58:34.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We drove 2 hours to shop at Peaches and it was well worth the drive. We received 5 star service from the minute we walked in the door and that's saying a lot in a world where most businesses don't have a clue how to give good service much less great service. They have built a finely tuned business that caters to young girls and women and they made us feel like we were valued customers even though this was our very first visit. They made sure that absolutely no detail was missed. We tried on several prom dresses and weren't sure if we were ready to make our final decision that day. But there was no high pressure sales pitch. They welcomed our questions and and answered them thoroughly. They even saved us from choosing a dress in the same style and color that another girl had already ordered for the same event. Wow!!! We drove home that night and ordered the dress we decided on about a week later. We were amazed at how quickly the dress arrived and how detailed the email communication was every step of the way. We are true and loyal fans and will be back next time we need a dress and will recommend your business to anyone who will listen to us brag about you incessantly!!! Thank you!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T23:37:38.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Ink station has originals as well as a selection of compatibles at greatly reduced prices in a variety of package deals or as individual toners. I have used compatible toners before without issue so was happy to try Ink Station as they had the best price and free delivery on my order as it was over a certain value. The order arrived on time, it only took a few days as it was in Australia, delivered to my door in excellent condition.

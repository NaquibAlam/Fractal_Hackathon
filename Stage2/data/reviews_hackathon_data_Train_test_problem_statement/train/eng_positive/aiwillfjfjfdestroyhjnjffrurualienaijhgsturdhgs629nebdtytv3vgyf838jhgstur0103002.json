I have received great results by calling North Shore on the phone.The Customer Service has been outstanding.\nI am a care giver for a lady and handle a lot of things for her that she has a problem taking care of herself. If I see an item that is new to me, the Customer Service folks always ask if I would like a sample of the product when order anything else from them.\nDelivery times are very good and the orders are complete when they are delivered.\nIf I hear that anyone I know is in need of supplies for the products that North Shore Supply carries, I have suggested that they contact North Shore Supply and discuss what is needed. I usually give people the web address AND the phone number.\nJoe Boyd\nAntioch, Ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T11:35:25.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

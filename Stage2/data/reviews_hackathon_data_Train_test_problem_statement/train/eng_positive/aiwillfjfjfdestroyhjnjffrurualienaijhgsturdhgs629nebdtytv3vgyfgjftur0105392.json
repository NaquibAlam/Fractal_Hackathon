We wanted it to be memorable and nostalgic and I opted to seek canvas print services. I am just so thankful I came across Canvasdiscount. To be fair, many people commented about the quality of the photo upon printing their canvasses. But I believe it's the size and quality of the picture they uploaded. Mine was perfect.\nAnd to this day, I have my 3 huge canvasses posted on the wall of my living room, and I still smile everytime I look at it. I remember our families and our wedding day. ALSO! Shipping was superb and unexpected. It came so fast, less than the days indicated. It also packaged very well and upon opening, it was tightly secured. I wish I can share you my wall and see my canvas prints. It's lovely.\nWill definitely get more canvas photos from this company! More power!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:43:09.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I did it though, slammed $300 down for Green Day pit tickets and was told they would come maybe 6 days before the concert. Needless to say they are sitting on my fridge(after purchasing maybe a week later and this was in January) counting down till September 5th. The transaction was painless, my anxiety sated and I will definitely purchase through here again. They even wished me a good time on the envelope! Very happy with the service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:21:44.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

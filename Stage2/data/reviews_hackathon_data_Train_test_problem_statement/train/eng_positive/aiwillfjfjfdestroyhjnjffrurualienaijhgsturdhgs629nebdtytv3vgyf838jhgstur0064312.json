Got a vehicle upgrade on collection which was a pleasant surprise. Originally rented for three days for a business trip, once I arrived at my destination I had to extend the rental by another three days. This was done very easily over the phone and the extra rental was even cheaper than the original rental price. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Easirent to friends and family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T22:40:59.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

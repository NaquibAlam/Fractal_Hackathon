The service was exemplary; they sent a lovely guy called James to do the work who was a real pleasure to have in the house for the week the work took. Nothing was too much effort for him as he had to work around an inquisitive two year old and pick his way through the random toys scattered around. By the time he had finished everything worked perfectly, all the mess was cleared up and he made sure we had the water and heating back on every evening in time for supper and bath time. I'd have James (\"James with the magnificent hair\" as he came to be known) back any time we need a plumber.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:40:14.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I believe it will fit our plans more than what we had chosen. He had just been there so was able to answer very specific questions we asked about rooms, activities etc...He never made me feel rushed and took a second call to help us, a conference call with my daughter where he was able to book both of us together. I have always just used apple vacations online and been fine with that but from now on, I will call Roman. We also each saved $100 with the promotion they had running on the website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T07:42:51.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

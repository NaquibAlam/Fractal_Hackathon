Having done home exchanges before, we were open to the notion of strangers looking after our house, but we were still a little hesitant because of the dogs. Nevertheless we took the plunge and signed up. We couldn't be happier - customer service responded to an oversight on my part and quickly gave me a partial refund. The website is very easy to use and within hours of posting we found a wonderful couple (from 7 responses in one day!) to look after our home and pets. This is a life-changer for us, giving us a newfound ability to travel without the expense of a kennel and concern about how the dogs are doing in a strange environment. We have already arranged a second house sit and look forward to more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:42:10.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

As time went by it got worse and more complicated, to the point that when I contacted Precision, I had just received an order to garnish my pay. After one phone call my garnishment was rescinded and I signed with Precision: at a fair fee schedule of monthly payments and with hopes of finally ending my tax nightmare.\nDuring this time I was also immersed in a new job, a divorce and raising my two children. It was slow going; I was late in getting documents to Precision and thought for sure they would cancel our agreement. But, they never gave up on me and continually, professionally, and personally were extremely patient and understanding. Their advice, perseverance and attention to details involving my situation; both for my taxes and my personal issues paid off in the end with an OIC that I had not thought possible. My tax debt of over $170k was settled for less than 4k!\nFor the first time in many years I now have the opportunity to get back on track and manage my finances and personal life on my terms, and not beholding to the IRS. I can not be more pleased with the service and results that I have received from everyone at Precision!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T22:33:47.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

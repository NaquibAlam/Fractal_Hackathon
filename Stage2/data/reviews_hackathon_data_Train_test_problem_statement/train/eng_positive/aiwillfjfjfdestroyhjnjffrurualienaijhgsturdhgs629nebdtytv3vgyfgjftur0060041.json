Nice to have our own apartment to get home to during the day. The company was easy to communicate with, both before and during our stay. We got instructions on how to get from the airport, we were met when we came off the boat, and guided to the apartment. We even got help from our contact person at VeniceApartments with our lost luggage at the airport - he made sure the bag arrived at the place we were staying. From our experience, I highly recommend VeniceApartments when finding a place to stay in Venice!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T16:25:46.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Received a tree in great shape, very healthy too. However I am 5'10, and root on the ground next to me, the tree was just about 6'. So I was a bit surprised, and disappointed. To be fair, I do not know how trees are actually measured by nursery's. Perhaps before any trimming? I don't know. But I did expect it to arrive between 7' & 8', so that is my review here. Based upon the quality of the tree I received, I would definitely buy from them again! Maybe next time I order an even larger size though????", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T03:44:20.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

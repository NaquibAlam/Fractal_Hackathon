WholeLatteLove.com has by far the best selection and very competitive pricing. It stocks recognizable brands with excellent reputations for quality products and dependable warranties.\nHowever, with all the models WLL has for sale, we had questions. When I called up Tech Support, the gentlemen spent a good amount of his valuable time explaining the advantages of each of the three machines we were considering, and he never once hedged his answer when we asked him a question. He was pleasant to deal with and very helpful, and armed with the information he had provided, we bought the perfect machine for us.\nIt arrived on time and was packaged well. It works flawlessly, is easy to operate, and makes perfect espresso. We could not be happier. And by the way, this is our third espresso machine, and it is head and shoulders superior to the first two. Thank you, WholeLatteLove. You're the best!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T05:10:18.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Everything went as stated. The transmission shipping box was clean, Trans was clean as new, each bolt bolt hole in trans was clean with excellent threads. The unit functioned perfectly! My application (Grand Prix GXP) is somewhat rare. GM used a performance style torque converter in this application, that I was concerned would be lost with a \"rebuilt\" trans. Stree Smart said it would be the correct one, and it was! I'm Very, Very pleased with the whole experience and will be back again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T15:36:39.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

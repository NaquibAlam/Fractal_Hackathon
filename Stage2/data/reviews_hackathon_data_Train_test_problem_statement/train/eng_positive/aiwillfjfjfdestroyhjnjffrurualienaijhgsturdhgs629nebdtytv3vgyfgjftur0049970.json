Carl and Leah always spoke in understandable terms, were attentive, patient and polite in giving information at the initial stages, in giving updated reports over the duration of ‘the opens’, in addressing any concerns and in having us all auction-ready.\nFurthermore, I would like to note the security which I felt in having my home in Carl’s leading hands as his knowledge, experience, confidence and positive attitude were always present in all our interactions; he carried the load of the work enabling me to largely experience the process in a stress-free and, as mentioned, secure way.\nIt is the third experience of using Nelson-Alexander in the sale of ‘homes’ within the family over time and consistently there has been satisfaction with the service and the outcomes.\nI happily and highly recommend Carl Sacco, Leah Cicutto and their team at Nelson Alexander.\nKerin Godfrey", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T23:54:45.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

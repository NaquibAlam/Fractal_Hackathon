The reviews it got were bad, but for the price, I ordered a dress for my prom anyway. The dress is so beautiful, looks amazing, and just like in the picture. However, please note before ordering: -The sizes do not fit as you expect. Ensure you measure yourself using the size chart before ordering, don't just order the size you usually would. I am a UK size 10, however I bought a UK size 16 for this dress and it fits perfectly! -The delivery takes longer than it states, so if you are in a hurry to receive the item, you should purchase from elsewhere! I ordered mine on 27th January and received it on 15th February. Hope this helps :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:48:45.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The only problem is the clasps easily come off with any stress to them. In the process of trying it on two of the clasps came off because the stitching holding them is not good. Luckily we were able to find the clasps so we can put back on. We will also be reinforcing all the clasps to prevent them from coming off in the future. Other than this I have no regrets purchasing this dress because it is beautiful and other than the slight problem we had it is everything I imagined it would be when I ordered it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:28:41.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Diane and Paul's knowledge of the area and experience helped us make informed decisions tailored to our family. They were always available. patient, and candid in their guidance. The Evolution yacht in the Galapagos was perfect - cabins, public areas especially sun deck, food, crew. And, our naturalist guides, Sam and Walter, were readily available to share knowledge and help everyone enjoy the experience. We had a mixed age group ranging from 12 to 70+. The teenagers brought great fun to the experience. Daily schedule was excellent with at least 1 hike, snorkel, plus other activities each day, with time for an afternoon rest and cocktails on the sundeck before the daily naturalist presentation and dinner. Don't hesitate to travel with Quasar - you'll be very happy!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:07:39.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

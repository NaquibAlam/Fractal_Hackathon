So we found FreedomVoice through an online ad and noticed they were a bit cheaper than our current provider. We decided to give them a call and test out the waters. We wanted to ensure that we'd still get the same service even though it's cheaper. We've been pleasantly surprised time and again at how much BETTER they actually are! We're paying less and getting better service! New service requests and support tickets would take days with our previous provider, but FreedomVoice has things up and running before you end your first call to them! We also like how we can setup almost everything by ourselves through their website without needing to call in. It's easy to see how they provide their startup offers with such confidence; once you try them, you really will be satisfied! Thank you to Carl and the rest of the team!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:55:33.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

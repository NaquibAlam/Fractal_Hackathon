Clear and informative web site made me find compatible product easy. Good payment process with plenty of shipping options. Delivery was exactly as promised, no delay of any kind. The only thing that can be improved is packaging. In my case two screens were placed in one padded envelope without any barriers between. Envelope was not secured in the cardboard box. This potentially could damage screens during the shipment. I, however, was lucky and this did not happen.\nThe quality of the product is very good, works perfectly OK, will see about longevity.

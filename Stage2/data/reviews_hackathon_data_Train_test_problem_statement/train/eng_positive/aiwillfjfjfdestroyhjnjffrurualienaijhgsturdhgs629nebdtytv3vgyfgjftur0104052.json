I am really pleased with the pram, I am still trying to get used to handling it all as in setting up and putting in bassinette etc.. but it seems quite easy. Only thing i would say is that the bassinette does not have a support strap inside to keep baby in place when lying down and so if you are using this mode and lift up your pram up a couple of steps for example your baby can slide down a bit in the bassinette. Otherwise so far so good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:25:01.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

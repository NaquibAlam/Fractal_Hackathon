The main problem I have is the significant time wasted because a) I can only request 1 day at a time instead of being able to compare pricing for 2 or more dates and b) if I compare 1-way to round trip options the screen keeps reverting back to previous data. For example, if I select 1-way for a specific date it takes a while for the screen to display info, only to result in the wrong flight details because it's displaying round trip details for a different date entered previously. Also, users have to be careful to avoid automatic extra charges by selecting NOT to have extra insurance and other options.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T10:56:19.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Husband is in wheelchair. I use lift to put him in extra long shower slider chair/toilet chair. It was perfect in length to when I slid him over into the shower...he actually was in the shower. Worked Perfect. Previous ones purchased where not extra long....so he ended up in the opening of the shower which was not doable. It is very sturdy and of good quality. So happy we found this product. Thank You. It changed our world. PS....since the shower curtain will not go over the bars....we cut the curtain to fit right down over the bars and used Velcro. worked great. :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:26:48.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Lots of Merchandise is displayed but inventory is almost non-existent. it's frustrating and takes so much longer to shop this because it's necessary to open item after item, starting with the first choice on down, searching for something in stock in any size. There are many good choices which would be great if available. Instead, it's a downer to shop for what you CAN'T have.\nThe new size filter will be a big improvement, but only if what is shown is available in the given size. It would also be an improvement to have a \"back\" button in the website instead of having to use the browser back. Every time it's used the system has to re-aquire the website.\nI selected the two special items, then clicked a clearance sale pop-up. Great sale! I put a sale item in my basket and, planning to return, went to other pages to check colors & matches. I suddenly realized there was no evident way of getting back to the sale page, and time was running out. There is no tab, link, or announcement on the home page and the pop-up wasn't popping-up, so I completed the check out with two seconds to spare.\nLater, I called customer service. The rep was very helpful. He explained how I could re-do the order, including the additional items I wanted. KUDOS for Customer Service. Work on that website and inventory for 5 stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T04:50:19.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

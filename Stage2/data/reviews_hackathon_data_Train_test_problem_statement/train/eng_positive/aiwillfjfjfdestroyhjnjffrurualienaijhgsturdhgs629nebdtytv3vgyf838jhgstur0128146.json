I check prices on Bookscouter, and I sell to several different services, but I use sellbackyourbook.com the most because their prices are usually the best. I send off the books, with their prepaid label, and they put the money in my PayPal account. It takes a little time, because the books go by media mail, but I get an e-mail from them to let me know the books have arrived and another when they have been checked. Once they made a mistake and said I omitted a book, but when I e-mailed them they quickly corrected it. Other than that I have had no issues, but I was impressed that they got back to me immediately that first time. The good prices and smoothness of transaction make this my first choice when I'm clearing off my shelves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T19:32:22.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

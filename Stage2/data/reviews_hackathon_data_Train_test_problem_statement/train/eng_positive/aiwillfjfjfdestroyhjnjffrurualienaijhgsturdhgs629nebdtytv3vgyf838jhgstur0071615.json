They will also assist you at one of their outlets, which will cost more and use DHL as their shipper, which makes tracking easy - if you want parcel pickup they will do that to. You will also get a more competitive rate than going through DHL directly. P&S were also a cheaper option than using Australia Post . Be aware of supplying copies of all relevant documentation so that your parcel doesn't get stuck in Customs like mine did in the destination country (Germany). If you don't have tracking like you do with P&S's service, then you've got no idea what is going on and the parcel will eventually return to sender !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T09:56:10.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Was allocated 11-1. Mobile driver (Sean) contacted me half an hour before arriving at 11. Extremely polite. 2 tyres fitted within half an hour. This is the third time I've used tyres on the drive and I have had no complaints on each occasion. Definitely beats the bad old of days of turning up at the garage to be ignored by a group of mechanics covered in oil! Thanks very much, would recommend to anyone. Convenient and competitively priced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T18:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:35:08.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Each time I bought the template and the template was exactly as it appears. Each time I also invested in the installation package to get it uploaded to my domain. And without fail, each time it was completed within minutes.\nAfter I purchased the template, within 3 minutes I received a phone call (late at night) asking if I purchased a template. I said \"yes\" and the caller thanked me and assured me they would get working on it right away. I thought this level of security was very impressive and professional. In fact, I'm now considering this in my own business practices.\nOnce I started trying to edit my page, it was not as easy as I had hoped. My limited knowledge of web design, html, and word press (in this case) really hindered me. I did not purchase any support package (not sure if they even offer that for sale) but I decided to write to support anyways and ask them for help. And within 24 hours the support team wrote me back and said they had fixed my issues for me. (thanks Alison!!)\nThis was not the first time I was impressed with their support. A few years ago, I purchased a template for an Ecommerce site (magento), and each time I needed help, they responded politely and professionally and helped me along the way until I felt my site was perfect. They never asked for more money. It was because of that experience that I came back to them for my new site. And because of their commitment to their customer's satisfaction that I will continue to come to them and advertise for them for anyone looking to build a professional site.\nFor a MINIMAL cost, you can have a professional looking site, with professional coders willing to help you along the way, and the complete support you need. It is absolutely a no-brainer going with this company for all your website needs and honestly you would be throwing money and time away by going elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T06:50:42.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I put in my criteria for a car needed in Ft Myers, FL and they came back with a rate that was 100.00 cheaper than anything I had found, on any of the other sites. Within an hour I had a confirmation that they had brokered a deal with Alamo for my car. Printed out all the necessary paperwork and when I arrived at the airport, went to the Alamo desk and gave them what I had, and I got my car. I will definitely use them all the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:36:49.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

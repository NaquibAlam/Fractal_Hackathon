I completed all the verifiable levels and had 3 honest/verifiable external references. Within 1 week I had my first house sit (a 10 day sit) based on the owner contacting one of my references and within 2 weeks I had my second house sit (3 months), which I just completed. I couldn't have done either of these if it wasn't for the network that is available through Trusted Housesitters. I am currently between house sits as I need to take care of some personal business but I would like to continue at this pace as a Trusted Housesitter.

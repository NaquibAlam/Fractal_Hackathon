With this system any water flow into the home beyond what is scheduled will activate an automatic stoppage of water into the home from the main. Besides buying a fail-safe system, you are also getting the expertise and service of a company that is the best that I have ever experienced. The phone never rings more than twice before you get help from the people that designed the system. They do stand behind it with service and warranty.

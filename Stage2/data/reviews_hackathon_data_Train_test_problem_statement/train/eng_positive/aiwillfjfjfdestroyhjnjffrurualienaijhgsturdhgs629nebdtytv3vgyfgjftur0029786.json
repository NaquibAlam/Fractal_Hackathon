I bought a used Rogers iPhone 7Plus over the weekend hoping to get it unlocked so I could use my Fido SIM card with the phone. I wasn't able to get it unlocked by Rogers because I am not an existing customer. I found UnlockRiver off of a youtube video and tried it out. Received an unlock code within 24 hours and worked perfectly. Hopefully it works in the long run but so far I'm completely satisfied with the service. Yes the price is a bit hefty but it gets the job done.

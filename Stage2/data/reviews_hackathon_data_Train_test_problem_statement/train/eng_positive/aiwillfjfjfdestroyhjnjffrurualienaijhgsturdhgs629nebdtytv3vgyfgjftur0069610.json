Ordered 2 for $20.00.\nAt checkout it said free shipping. After checkout they added $11.00 for shipping. Called and talked to 3 different people. No explanation as to why shipping was added on after checkout. Asked to cancel order and received conformation later in the day. After receiving the confirmation I received an e-mail that the order had been shipped. Called today and was told that the manufacturer had refused the cancellation. I said that I did not want them. After some arguing about their deceptive checkout she said that I could return it for a full refund. The manufacturer is supposedly sending me shipping label. She said that they would waive the return fee. I am sure that this will take another 2 weeks And I will be charged some kind of fee. I don't care whatever they would offer that I don't want their filters. Getting thru to them takes 20-30 minutes and then they transfer you for another wait before you talk to someone.

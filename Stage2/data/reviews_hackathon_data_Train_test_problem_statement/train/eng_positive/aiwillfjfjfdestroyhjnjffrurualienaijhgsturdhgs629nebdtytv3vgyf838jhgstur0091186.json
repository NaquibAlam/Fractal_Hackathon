We all enjoyed our stay there, the pool and outside space is excellent and having the pool heated is a big plus and was used every morning before breakfast. The closeness to the town centre was probably he biggest bonus as it was easy to get right among the buzz. I would say that the kitchen oven is need g replaced as it seemed not to heat up well and the frying pans are a bit passed their best. Everything else was very good with lots of lovely hot water and the view down to the sea was a bonus too. All in all we would be happy to return to the villa next year, when all being well we should have a new grandchild so the extra space will be very useful. As ever many thanks to your prompt action on the one or two requests we made to the support team, these are the things that make us want to use Optima Villas.

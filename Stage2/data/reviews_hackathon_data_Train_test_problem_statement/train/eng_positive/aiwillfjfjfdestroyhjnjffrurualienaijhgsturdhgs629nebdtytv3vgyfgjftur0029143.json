Since then, Articulate have moved to the Cloud and introduced new products such as Rise and Review. They have also greatly improved the number and library of templates and characters. Rise and Review are exceptional additions to the Articulate family.\nMy only concern is the pricing strategy. I understand moving to the Cloud with all of the benefits that provides in terms of stability and upgrading applications. But at a projected annual subscription of $999 and no projected facility to pay for individual applications, I wonder whether this might be off-putting for those, like me, who create eLearning for charities and seek no payment and for those who do not use every application this might cause hesitation in commiting to products that could not later be amended.\nFor me, at the moment, the suite of applications and the most exceptional community are benefits that would lead me to persuade she who holds the purse strings that I could not live without them!! But my task would be made much easier if there was a more flexible pricing strategy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T20:12:45.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

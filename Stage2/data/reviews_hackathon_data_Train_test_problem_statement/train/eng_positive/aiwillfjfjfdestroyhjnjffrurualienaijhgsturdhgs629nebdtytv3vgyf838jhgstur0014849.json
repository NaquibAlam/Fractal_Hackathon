We use their contact database to manage our membership, track event participation and develop focused email lists to promote our event both inside and outside the organization. A a small, all volunteer and non-profit club, it's important that whatever systems we use are easy to understand and use, intuitive in nature and deliver good results for the efforts expended. CC meets all these criteria and more.\nOur email campaigns and events are successful and very professional looking. Communications with our members are easy. Managing email lists is simple and easy and keeps our time spent on managing our membership efficient and productive.\nCC's templates work well for us and since many of our emails and events are the same year to year, updating and re-sending them saves us a ton of time on developing and launching a campaign. I did take one star away because sometimes the templates are less than user friendly and can be frustrating to work with.\nWhile using CC obviously costs money, we have found the annual cost to be well worth the time, energy and productivity saving realized by using them. I feel that our growth in both reputation and membership has been in no small part a result of our using CC, the professionalism they impart on us and the ease of use that keeps us as a customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T22:30:59.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

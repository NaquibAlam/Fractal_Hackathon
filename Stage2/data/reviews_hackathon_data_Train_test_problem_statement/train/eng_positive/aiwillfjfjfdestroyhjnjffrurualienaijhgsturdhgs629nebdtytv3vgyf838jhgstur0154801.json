It's fun to look on their website and to see what they have available to order. The choices change daily and there's usually around 10 dishes to choose from. Almost everything I've ordered has been quite good and I have a choosy palate. The food ranges from fish to pasta to chicken and much more. I don't like to cook everyday and enjoy ordering two or three dishes from Munchery every week to fill that need. Try them, you'll like it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T14:33:29.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

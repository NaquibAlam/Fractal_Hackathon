Within 48 hours of filling in the easy to follow online claim form, I received an email informing me that my claim was going to be settled in full.\nI can't recommend rentalcars.com highly enough!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:12:12.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

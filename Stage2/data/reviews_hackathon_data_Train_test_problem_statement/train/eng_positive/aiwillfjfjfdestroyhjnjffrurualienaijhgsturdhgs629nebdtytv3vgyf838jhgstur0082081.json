Knowing that we had pet insurance meant that we could focus on getting her the treatment she needed and getting her home asap. Claiming is so easy and payments are processed pretty quick. I highly recommend Bow Wow Meow to everyone - never had an issue with a claim and if you need to speak to someone, customer support is great. Easy 5 stars from me :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T21:14:37.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I wasn't looking to spend a lot on my prom dress this year so I kept it under 200 but most of those dresses only came in small medium and large which makes it hard. I'd love to see at least x small and x large but also short regular or long lengths. It will help the costumers be more satisfied and the business as more people will be willing to buy a dress. Also love the return policy! Makes it less stressful to be able to order a couple dresses and return the ones I'm not satisfied with!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:29:46.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Overall, they seem to be healthy, although one of my hickories had a broken tap root. Also, it is a little early in the process to evaluate some of them, as they haven't started leafing out yet.\nI selected the option to have them be delivered in Spring, since I ordered them in mid-winter. This is a great option to have, although I didn't know when they were going to be arriving.\nI'm excited for my trees to grow! I should follow up on this in 3 to 8 years, but that's probably not going to happen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:42:33.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We were given a new Toyota Rav4 Hybrid. Lovely car. The staff are very nice to deal with, polite and helpful. Be aware of the high charge for fuel when paid up front. We were charged 84 pounds for a tank of petrol but when we had to top up the car again during the trip 20 pounds was half a tank. The hybrid car was not very economical, best we had (using the onbord computer) was 34 to the gallon over nearly 400 miles of mostly dual carriageway driving. The rental company has very keen pricing, are very helpful and I would definately recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:55:33.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

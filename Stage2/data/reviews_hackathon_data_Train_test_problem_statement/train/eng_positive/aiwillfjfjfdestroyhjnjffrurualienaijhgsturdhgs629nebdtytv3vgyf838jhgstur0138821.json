He has found it easy and reliable and can now contact family members when he is out if he needs to. It has proved very useful to pick him up after appointments as he can now just call when he is ready, and it has added to my peace of mind to know he has it. I bought the phone outright and used a cheap sim as he intended to use it only in emergencies and the plans did not suit his needs. I was disappointed to have to replace the phone so soon after purchase because of the discontinuation of the 2G network and thought perhaps the KISA team might have been aware of the coming need to change before selling the original phone. Aside from that my only other comment is that pocket dialling is a slight problem so some sort of key pad lock might be helpful. Otherwise an excellent product and the KISA staff have always been easy to deal with and very helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:28:22.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

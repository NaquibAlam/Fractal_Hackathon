The online ordering functionality and website layout makes it incredibly easy to place your order and filter through the restaurants menu options. They also are always there should any issues arise and handle the communication between the customer and restaurant which is a huge time saver for someone with a lot on her plate! Only complaint is that I want them to add more restaurants!! We want to be able to use them more frequently!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:22:30.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

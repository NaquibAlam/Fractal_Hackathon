I would recommend them every time.\nLucy is very committed and genuinely cares for all our dogs and all her hosts and she matches them well.\nWe feel so lucky with the service and would like to say 'thank you' to Lucy and all her hosts!\nWoof woof woof üêæ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T20:30:47.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I reckon quality is worth paying for.\nThere are several suppliers who print and bind well, after all their printing and binding equipment is available on the open market but to me the most important factor is their software. I never allow a Wizard to design my book for me, I put every picture through Photoshop and place and size them all individually. Now that Shakespeare have closed down this is the only company I know that allows total control of size, location, alignment and framing both of the pictures and accompanying text.\nIf you want the best, this is it.\nThe only deficiencies are the inability to print a whole copy of the book as a final proof and to show just one whole page in proof-read mode to maximise screen area. You can only print one double page at a time and that is tedious with a large book.\nThese are hardly life and death problems though. If I found a better supplier I would consider changing - but there isn't one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T13:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:04:23.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

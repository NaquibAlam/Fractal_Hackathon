There two inconsistent and confusing statements about that product. One would expect this to be truly smoked sable (hot or cold). This is not the case. There is another description for this product and talks about infused smoking. What is infused smoking? What specifically is being used for it? This is not adequately explained. What is the brand of product being used.\nI have assumed that this product is ready to eat. This is not the case, it has to be cooked. I have thawed and broiled the sable. It tasted very good but the mystery of infused smoking influenced how sable tasted. Please help me resolve this mystery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:14:16.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The product was easy to install and customer care was quick to respond to inquiries. The product was delivered to my home and the self installation guide allowed me to set up the system and have it working the same day.\nI love the mobile app and the ability to control my home lights and garage door with my cell.\nOverall the product offers a lot for the price you pay for it. Definitely worth the investment!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T19:01:56.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We had alot of questions that were all answered immediately and booking the trip was easy. We were able to fly out from the location we selected and secured non-stop flights which was very important. The price is very good for the destination and Roman our booking agent was awesome. We are looking forward to vacation, a great trip and making memories. I would definitely use Blue Sun again. Thanks again for your assistance in what we know will be a great time!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T07:32:49.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

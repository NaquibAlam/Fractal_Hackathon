We however, we were very disappointed that we didn't have ocean front accommodations on all three islands. Oahu was excellent, Hawaii was unsatisfactory (1st floor overlooking the pool and it's noise) and Maui was unsatisfactory (balcony view was overlooking the tennis court and parking lot). Out of group of 38, several couples also experienced non-oceanfront rooms. They were also very disappointed. We requested oceanfront accommodations when our arrangements were made with our travel agent. This disconnect needs to be resolved in order to fully enjoy your vacation in paradise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:09:32.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

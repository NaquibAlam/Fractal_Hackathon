Food was plentiful and delicious. Crew was very friendly and helpful. Captain and expedition leader worked hard to make sure we had many landings and experiences. Very reasonable policy regarding bringing liquor on board. A few glitches here and there, with team leaders learning to work as a team, and I would have liked to have my window cleaned properly, but all in all they did an excellent job and I definitely recommend the company.

Today, the restaurant I ordered from messed up my order completely. The mishap caused it to be delivered not only late but also with key items missing. For those that work in a corporate setting, mainly a law firm, you understand how \"hangry\" people in that setting can get and the small window of time people have to take a lunch. The food was for a 2 hour board meeting and I received confirmation via EZ Cater the order was on time to be delivered at 11:45 am. I receive a call at 11:45 from Kendra at EZ Cater informing me the restaurant did not make my order but they are working on it now and will bring it no later than 12:30. Of course this sent me into a panic but I sent out an e-mail informing those attending the meeting of the mishap. The food arrived and by the time the caterer left, I noticed some items were left out of my order and other things were just wrong. Kendra from EZ Cater called me back and could hear the frustration in my voice and went above and beyond to make it right. She contacted the restaurant to arrange for them to bring the correct items back and to discount my next order. After an hr and the meeting was over, the items never arrived so I contacted EZ Cater to cancel the rush order. I was able to talk to Patch (Patrick) on chat and vented my frustration. Kendra placed notes on my record so Patrick already knew the background story of the fiasco. He also apologized on the restaurant's behalf and adjusted some items to be taken off my current invoice. The service that Kendra and Patrick showed today is why I love EZ Cater! Their thoughtfulness and kind words were really the highlight of my day. I felt so defeated after the horrible way the lunch was handled by the restaurant and the care those two showed to rectify the situation was mind blowing. I can't give them enough accolades for what they did today. I don't know what is given to employees who go above and beyond but I hope it involves a promotion and raise. These two individuals are definitely who you want to represent your company. If it wasn't for them, I would've cancelled my account today. Kendra and Patrick if you ever get to read this review, thank you so much for what you did today. You both made a stressful situation better and handled it with ease and compassion. If I could, I would give y'all a bonus and a promotion. You both deserve it! Thanks again and take care. EZ Cater, give these guys a promotion!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:21:23.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

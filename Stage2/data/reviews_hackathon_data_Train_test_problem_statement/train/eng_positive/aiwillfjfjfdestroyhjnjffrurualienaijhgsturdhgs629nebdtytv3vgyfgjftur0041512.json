MyChromo GmbH responded immediately to my first email with a clear breakdown of the expenses (cost of watch, shipping, PayPal, German duties) and on the time necessary for custom clearance and actual shipment. Within hours the also responded to following emails. At the end, it took less than they stated. Two days after sending the payment I received the watch.\nBravo!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T19:31:01.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

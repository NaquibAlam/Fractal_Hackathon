Went online and found this service and sort of felt like it was a longshot. Called them Sunday night, got all my papers together on Monday, fedex'd them out and sure enough, my passport came back on Thursday so I could catch my Friday AM flight to Ireland. It worked for me. Although they say 24-hour service, with the delivery and all, for me it was mail out on Monday and get back on Thursday.\nThe service isn't cheap, but it did work and helped me avoid a real catastrophe. Nice people... Good communication and thorough. If you're in a rush and you can afford it, it certainly worked for me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T20:29:02.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

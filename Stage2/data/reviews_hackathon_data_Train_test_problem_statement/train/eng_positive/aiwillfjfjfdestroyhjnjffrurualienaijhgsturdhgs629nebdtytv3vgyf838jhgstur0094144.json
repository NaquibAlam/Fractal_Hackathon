I now believe I have a reasonable grasp of the concept of solar energy, certainly enough to be able to decide what type of equipment will suit my requirements.\nInformation regarding the three installer companies was sent to me immediately and they all called me that day. One, from our town, arranged to meet me at home the next day. We had a long discussion regrading the type of panel and the use of micro-inverters for my installation. He then climbed up onto the roof to measure the areas on which I required the panels to be placed.\nBefore leaving he presented me with his Quote: .\nThe second, from a city approx. 100km away, visited a few days later. He was not completely switched on regarding the equipment, in particular the options re micro-inverters to extend the system later and to add battery backup. He promised to give me a Quote: but two weeks later, despite several unanswered calls from me, there has been no further contact.\nThe third, from a border town not too far away, took two weeks to pay me a visit, although the day before he did send through a very low Quote: . He also did not seem to be on top of the equipment required, calling micro-inverters \"microwaves\" and suggesting that he would fit the inverter next to the meter box! I reminded him that an inverter would not be required since we were installing \"microwaves\".\nI accepted the local Quote: , although it was the highest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T06:15:00.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

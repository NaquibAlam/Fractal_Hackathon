I no longer wanted to keep my landline phone service and Smith Thompson offered a wireless alternative. Not only am I saving almost $800 per year by not having a home phone line anymore, but I am also saving another $500 per year compared to my old security monitoring system. We recently moved and Smith Thompson is with us at the new house as well. Very Happy with our service and how affordable it is.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:26:00.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I had already tried the glasses on at a department store so I knew the style and fit was to my liking. What really impressed me about SmartBuyGlasses was how responsive their customer service was. I used PayPal to purchase the glasses but PayPal used the wrong shipping address. I used the customer service chat feature and they were able to correct the shipping address in a matter of minutes. The glasses arrived in a few days. The glasses were also about $60 cheaper than what I could find in the department stores! Thank you SmartBuyGlasses!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:19:09.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

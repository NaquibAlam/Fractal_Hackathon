When I first discovered them I tried ordering without their assistance and nothing I got fit (my god-daughter loved it though because she got several free outfits). However once I decided to let them pick my outfits based on their recommended size I've been loving them and I get a lot of compliments on my outfits too. I'm a fashionista in the gym...lol.\nOn another note, I just noticed that they've now added plus sizes and I'm so happy to see that...hey big girls like to look sharp too.

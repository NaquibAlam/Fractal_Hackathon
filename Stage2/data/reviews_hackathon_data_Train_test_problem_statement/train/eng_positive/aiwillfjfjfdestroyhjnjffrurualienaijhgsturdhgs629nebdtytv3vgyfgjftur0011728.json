The Banker Dan Levescue\nvery effiecent, accommodating as well as friendly. The loan assistant Jerry Evans was also excellent. Every thing they said happened exactly as stated.\nI have had several mortgage transactions, all were tedious, slow and very annoying and usually at least one negative surprise . Quicken was so fast and easy ,I can not think of one aspect of the process to improve. I will strongly urge anyone in need of a mortgage or refi, to make QUICKEN THEIR FIRST AND ONLY CHOICE.

I really didn't know mattresses only lasted 10 or so years. Except for back pain, which I didn't blame on the mattress, it looked and felt fine.\nWell, these things sure have come a long way in 34 years. Definitely softer on the top than our old one but very supportive throughout. After a few minutes of laying on it you feel as if it has enveloped your entire body and provided support to every surface. I woke up with no back pain after the first night, I never expected that.\nI was hesitant ordering online but the reviews sold me plus I had recently done the same thing with a leather recliner from Casco Bay and that worked out great.\nI would say that if you want a state of the art mattress, quick delivery, and a product of exceptional quality then order from Saatva!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:29:12.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

For almost 12 months now I have used 3 different transfer companies to try to get the best rate. This is important being as the Pound to Euro exchange rate has been so volatile of late.\nThis month I tried 'CurrencyFair' for the first time, and I found that their exchange rate was really EXCELLENT compared to the others I had been using. As long as they continue to give me a top rate I cannot see any reason to change them.\nWhen I first tried setting up my account with them, I had some questions, which were quickly answered by a member of their team, and once I finally set up my account with them, my transaction was quick and easy. My money arrived in my overseas account the next day, as expected and their charge was really minimal, especially when compared to what the bank charges.\nThis was truly an excellent service, and I only hope that I will be able to continue using CurrencyFair each month in future.\nWell done to them - Five Stars all the way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T09:16:20.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

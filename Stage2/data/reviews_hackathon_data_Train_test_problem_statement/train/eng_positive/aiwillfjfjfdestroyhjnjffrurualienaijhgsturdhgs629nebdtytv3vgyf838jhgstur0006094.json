I had a great experience with them. But I think the property itself could use some updating. The office could be updated and the security of the location also. The fence around the facility is pretty beat up and in the back corner anyone could step over and walk onto the property. Also the entry gate needs to be updated to be on the same standard as other places. But overall great staff, great prices, but needs some TLC.

I was impressed with the live chat as I had a few queries which were answered immediately. My son is special needs with LGS and due to the massive side effects of anticonvulsants we felt our next step was to try Endoca Hemp Oil....we have tried pretty much everything else so why not give this a try. I am happy to say that with the first bottle we feel that we have had a few improvements and we hope we will have more. We have had a slight reduction in seizures, definitely a difference in his recovery after seizures, even the very strong ones which would sometimes leave him very disorientated and agitated. When he has these \"after effects\" we occasionally have to give him Stedon or rectal Stesolid but since using the hemp oil we have not needed to use either of these medications. Sleep was also a very big problem for him but over the last couple of weeks there has been a slight difference there too, much calmer and even slept right through a couple of nights. Another very very big plus for us is that there seems to be no side effects since he started the hemp oil, so that alone has made the whole process less daunting. We will continue to use the hemp oil and it would be nice to see more improvements. I would like to say to anyone reading this review, try it, I recommend it and believe you have nothing to lose. Lastly, I must also add that during our trials we have the support of our neurologist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:08:46.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

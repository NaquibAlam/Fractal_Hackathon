I have been dealing with Carl for over 10 years and I can not speak highly enough of his professionalism, honesty and integrity during what can be a stressful period. Carl brings real local knowledge - not just of the local market but of the surrounding areas which becomes critical when considering how to market the property. Now introducing Leah who completes the team to provide a perfectly working machine with a broad smile and heaps of energy. Leah has been a dream to deal with. She is incredibly efficient and makes all processes completely effortless. The Auction Campaign all in all was a piece of cake and I walked out above the reserve. Couldn't be happier with the process or the result. Thanks Carl and Leah.

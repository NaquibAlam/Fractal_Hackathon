They have helped me when I didn’t get my items or if something was faulty. Banggood worked with me/fairly. They do have Live support 24/7 and a sales team avalible (though not fluent in english)during specific hours to help with product information, Pictures are detailed from multiple angles with product description and unlike other websites their product matches the picture. They have helped me find items associated with certain products, making my shopping experience easier. In the case of Name brand competitors such as a top rated shipping company I got my money back but I never ended up with my product twice, because they had placed my order with fake sellers. As far as I know bangood does not have fishy sellers/or warehouses. Ive order a decent amount from banggood more then I care to admit, I love the fact they offer wholesale deal and free shipping on a majority of their products, and sometimes offers sales or deals on certain items. Tracking and or Insurance is Highly recommend for more expensive items . Banggood is one of my Favorite Online websites and top Chinese Online retailer , Some websites charge shipping per item, and on the small objects its not that bad, but overall the shipping cost will add up quick, which I only use if I can not find what I am looking for at an reasonable price. I enjoy using banggood shopping for unique products that are not common / mainstream and much more costly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T07:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T22:40:19.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

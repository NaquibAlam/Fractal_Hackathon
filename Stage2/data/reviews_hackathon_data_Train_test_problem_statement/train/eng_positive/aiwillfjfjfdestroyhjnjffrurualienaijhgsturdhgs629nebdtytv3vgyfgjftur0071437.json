Was contacted shortly after to confirm arrival time. The Omega d√©potons Nelson isn't at the airport, so they come and pick you up and take you to get your car. That all worked smoothly. The woman who sorted out the paperwork for us was lovely and had a great dry sense of humour. The car was as advertised (something unusual with renting cars, in my overseas experience at least). The drop off was handled efficiently and we were given a lift to the airport. Would definitely rent from these guys again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:03:17.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After ordering, I discovered a similar model on sale on Amazon for less. There was no problem in cancelling the order and ordering the cheaper model. The system arrived ahead of schedule (within 6 days). As it had a trim plate that was not large enough for my installation I returned the smaller one for a larger trim plate. The return and refund was expedited with excellent customer service.\nAll in all I am quite impressed with the quality of the product and the service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:53:32.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

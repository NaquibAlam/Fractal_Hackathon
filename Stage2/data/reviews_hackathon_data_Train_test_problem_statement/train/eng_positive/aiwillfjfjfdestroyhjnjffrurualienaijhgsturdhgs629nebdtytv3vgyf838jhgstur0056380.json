In both cases, my money reached its intended destination very quickly, at the exchange rate advertised and agreed.

Needless to say this can be a bit alarming, but don't panic: it is coming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T14:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:07:26.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

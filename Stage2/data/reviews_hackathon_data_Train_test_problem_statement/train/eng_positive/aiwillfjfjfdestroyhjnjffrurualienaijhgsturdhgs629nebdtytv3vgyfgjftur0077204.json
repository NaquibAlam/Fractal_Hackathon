We were new comers to Costa Rica and a little nervous about going to a new country where we didn't speak Spanish. Robin Sabine, our agent at Costa Rican Vacations, took care of everything! Arranged for our pick up at the airport, helped us get through customs, made us feel safe the entire time. Even called us out of the blue at our hotel on several occasions to see if we needed anything.\nI can't say enough good things about this company. We have just used them for our second trip to CR and would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:17:26.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The Island of Cuba is approximately the same size as Tennessee, 42,000 acres, and its shape is as if giant hands had seized Tennessee by its East and West borders and stretched it out to a ragged 780 miles in length. The name Cuba (pronounced “kooba) comes from the word “cubao” of the aboriginal Taino inhabitants of the Island and means “a place of much fertile land.” Its current population is approximately 11 million, made up of almost every race on earth. Since ownership of guns is illegal, Cuba has almost no crime, and every city and village is safe throughout. In short, a most inviting prospect for a tour.\n Jennifer and I arrived at Sky Harbor in great spirits for our Educational Tour of Cuba with Joel and Judy Brooks, our traveling companions. Jennifer and I were particularly anxious to try out our new “TSA Known Traveler” status because it would allow us to get in the short Known Traveler line for the grueling passage through the electronic security system. Sure enough it worked and we did not even have to open our suitcases, open our computers, take off shoes, or show other electronic gadgets. What a relief! Our tour is with Globus Tours, a well-established American tour company with a splendid reputation.\n In no time we were safely aboard our Airbus 321 and sailing away to Miami. When we arrived we took the shuttle to the Sheraton Airport Hotel and checked in. At 6:00 PM we met the other members of our Tour for an initial briefing and “getting to know each other” session. Delia Niezguski, a very attractive, very competent Spanish American Group Leader from El Paso Texas, explained to the 27 of us all the details we needed to know. Afterward we all introduced ourselves and when one woman introduced herself as Meredith Parker of the Makah Indian Reservation, which located on the northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State, I almost fell off my chair! I blurted out “Meredith, I haven’t seen you in 100 years!”\n Well it turned out that I had never seen Meredith, it was her grandmother who was a good friend of mine when I was tribal lawyer for the Makah Indian Tribe back in the 1960s and thereafter. But Meredith said she had certainly heard of me and all the legal work our firm did for her tribe in winning, in the United States Supreme Court, the treaty-guaranteed right of all of the Washington coastal tribes to one-half the salmon in the Puget Sound and offshore in the Pacific Ocean. Then we all schmoozed a bit, and laboriously filled out our visa application and two other detailed documents required by Cuban authorities for our tour. We were delighted to have Delia for our Group Leader because not only did she exude confidence, but she taught Spanish in high school in El Paso, Texas for 20 years. What better preparation to lead us through Cuba?\n Before we began the tour, the issue of Cuban money was explained to us. The Cuban equivalent of our dollar is the peso, divided into cents. Visitors may not have or spend pesos but instead must spend CUCs (pronounced “kooks”) – which seems to stand for Cuban Units Convertible, although we could never get the exact words no matter how hard we tried. The discount rate is 13%, so $100 will buy 87 CUCs. American dollars cannot be used in Cuba, although they are occasionally, and there seems to be no repercussion from their use\n At the end of the meeting I telephoned Mark Bain, our wonderful nephew, and arranged for him and his lovely wife, Ayme, to come to the Hotel for dinner. The six of us enjoyed a wonderful dinner in the Hotel and we caught up with all of Mark's and Ayme's doings. Mark is a lawyer and percussionist and Ayme, a jazz singer, is just finishing her degree in Autism and Speech Therapy. They met through music as Ayme was performing in various venues in the Miami area and Mark had his own band. That meeting led to marriage and a most attractive and highly talented couple.\nDay 2\n Next morning Delia gathered her flock and we proceeded to the Miami Airport. She had arranged for us to be processed as a group and so we had our own American Airlines agent checking us, in. Unfortunately, the procedure was extremely slow and somehow Jennifer and I wound up the last two people in line. We explained to the agent that our TSA status had not been printed on our boarding passes and provided her our TSA numbers. But once she plugged them into the computer, it refused to recognize them and so our special boarding status was denied!\n During the process, though, she did discover my frequent flyer number for American Airlines which she put into her computer, and then printed out a second boarding pass for me bearing my frequent flyer number. She handed our boarding passes to a Cuban agent who stamped each with a little round circle in which was printed \"Cuba Ready,” the sine qua non for visitors to Cuba and gave them to me. Jennifer, Delia and I traipsed on down to our boarding gate security line and I handed our passports and boarding passes to the agent before heading to the electronic scanning system. I was surprised to be called back by the agent who pointed out that we had given him two boarding passes for me and none for Jennifer!\n Egad, the ticket agent handed the Cuban agent both boarding passes of mine, so Delia and I scurried back to the American Airlines agent's window to retrieve the other boarding pass. The agent was shocked to discover what she had done and quickly turned to the wastebasket in which she had thrown Jennifer’s boarding pass by mistake; fortunately, the wastebasket was open at the top and she easily found it, so Delia and I scurried back to the gate where Jennifer awaited us. When we went through the security line it seemed I was a walking metal storage area because when I put my iPhone and iPod and pens in the basket for the scanner and went through the doorway, the buzzer sounded and I was sent back. So I found the hearing aid controller in my left pocket which I placed in another basket and went through the second time – no dice! So I removed my watch and took out my nonmetallic wallet which I placed in another basket and tried a third time – no dice! In the end I had to place my belt in another basket for the fourth try, holding my pants up with my left hand; it worked and fortunately I did not have to remove my wedding ring or unscrew the anchors in my lower jaw of my two dental implants! Life can be parlous indeed!\n The flight to Cuba was an excruciating one in an Airbus 319 in which we were jammed into a three-row section with the seats in front of us about two inches from my knees – simply horrible! Luckily the flight to Camaguey (pronounced “Comma-way”), one of the three largest Cuban cities, was only 54 minutes long and we were happy to squeak out of the plane at the Ignacio Agramonte Airport. Agramonte was a hero in Cuban history; during our tour we encountered many monuments, squares, and buildings named after other heroes in Cuba’s history. As we exited the Airport we found a large gathering of Cubans, anxious for the arrival of the relatives from the United States whom they had not seen for many years, and a parking lot full of American automobiles from the 1950s. I spotted my 1956 Chevrolet and a 1950 Cadillac almost like my Cadillac Coupe Deville \"Clytemnestra.\"\n Once aboard the coach for our tour which turned out to be brand spanking new Yutong Coach, built in China since no American vehicles have been imported since the Revolution in 1958, we met our Tour Director, Giselle Farinas, a beautiful, petite young woman who graduated from the University of Havana with a degree in Language, and who spoke beautiful English. We became very fond of her throughout the entire tour as she was so charmingly vivacious and practically a walking encyclopedia concerning Cuba’s history, its culture, its people, its monuments, its geography, its cities and its enticing sites of every kind.\n With our coach driver, Jorge, at the helm, and Giselle standing with her microphone at the front of the coach, we set out for our first adventure – a visit to the Maria Taquina Art Gallery, set in a tight little cul-de-sac at the end of which was an ancient but small Cathedral. The little square in front of the cathedral featured a number of life-size bronze statues of people in daily life poses: housewives sitting on chairs and chatting, a man pushing a cart loaded with large ollas for water, a man sitting on a park bench reading a newspaper. We all took pictures of ourselves in various poses with the statuary and entering the gallery for an introductory speech and a viewing through the open air garden area and rooms full of paintings and sculpture. The gallery personnel seem to be quite proud of a small bronze in the garden of a woman who had pulled down her panties and was squatting to urinate with water dripping from her bottom into the pool beneath her and spilling over into a larger catch basin! I must say I was somewhat taken aback!\n Giselle showed us a number of other beautifully restored squares in the city and we could easily understand why Camaguey is known as the “City of Squares.” Jorge drove us to our five-story hotel, the Gran Hotel, where we settled in, then gathered in a charming interior courtyard, open to the sky, and furnished with cast-iron tables and chairs and large pots of houseplants. We were served our first traditional Cuban “welcome drink.” It is always served in cylindrical glasses two inches in diameter and six inches high, and is a mojito – comprising sugarcane juice, lime juice, soda water and mint. After it is served, a waiter comes around and pours in the Cuban rum to complete the cocktail. A charming tradition!\n We then congregated in the dining room for a magnificen", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:09:34.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

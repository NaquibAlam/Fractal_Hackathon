I was asked by a close friend to purchase a website template she wanted for a business and needed a domain transferred from one site to another. I found a site for her, transferred the domain and downloaded a template she liked from Template Monster. The purchase process was straight forward and very speedy and was quite secure. I received a call and text confirming what I had done and the credit card, text, and email confirmation. Impressive!\nThe people I spoke with were very professional and security minded. Once I downloaded the template and transferred it to the site, I needed help as this was the first time I had ever done anything like this in a Windows environment. I searched out some tech docs on the very easy to navigate Template monster site and was able to perform the install with picture pages for reference on the tech docs from their site! However, due to my inexperience I ran into some buttons and functions I made when setting up the basic website prior to installing the desired template from Templatemonster. I received a follow-up email on my template purchase from Zoe Brooks. She was professional, understanding and knowledge about the tech support process and she even setup the support ticket for me when I informed her of some challenges I was having. I then received emails from the following technical people in this order, to assist me with different formatting challenges I was experiencing...Joy Anderson,Susan White,Grace Kerrigan, Alison Mitchell, Tyler Warren. All of these techs were very helpful, well knowledgeable about the product, and extremely accommodating in support service! Some how, I am sure due to my\nlack of knowledge, the template was slightly larger on the new website than it was from the demo on Templatemonster. The techs Alison Mitchell and Tyler Warren, I believe, suggested they could re-download the template and install it again for me! Their efficiency was perfect and their attitudes were kind beyond belief! They were able to get the website up and running. The entire team exceeded my expectations in technical support and genuine customer service! I deal with large companies like Hewlett Packard and IBM and they could truly learn technical support skills and problem ownership and kind attitude from Templatemonster! Had it not been for the before mentioned team that all worked together with me, I would never have gotten the website up and running for my dear friend!! I highly recommend any first time or even experienced website technicians or masters to use Tempatemonster for not only their amazing and dedicated tech support but also their wide creative variety of templates for a cornucopia of business needs and styles to personal fun sites. They are a remarkable company with true professional people that care about your needs!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T10:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:30:09.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

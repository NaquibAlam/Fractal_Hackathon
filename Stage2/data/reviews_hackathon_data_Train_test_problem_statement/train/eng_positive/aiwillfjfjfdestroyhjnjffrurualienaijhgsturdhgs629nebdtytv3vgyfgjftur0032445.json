When all the camp participants had arrived, the weekend was about to start. The meals were nice, the games and courses were great but also really exhausting (Ultimate Frisbee! Water Battle!!! Parcour!) and so, no matter what you booked, the Nature-Ticket(bring your own tent, mixed genders possible) or the Camper Ticket(sleep with your guys/gals and leave your snoring girl-/boyfriend in another one), you sure slept tight as hell. It was uber-fun, peaceful, easy-going and relieving. Oh, did I mention no cellphones allowed? Completely forgot about that. It was the same on that weekend. I didn't even think about it once.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T23:04:20.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We became aware of Pelican Water Systems through our plumber. I quickly called and worked with Patrick for our order. I had many questions, of which all were answered. I had a small hiccup on my end with regards to the faucet finish that I had ordered; but, that was quickly remedied by the Service team. Clemente was excellent on the phone and went the extra mile to ensure I received my replacement faucet overnight.\nThe water quality is amazing! We are extremely happy with the product and hope that the quality of the water holds true in the coming weeks and months. Great Customer Service and a true focus on ensuring the customer is fully satisfied.\nThanks.

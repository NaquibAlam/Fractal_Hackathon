She was like a second family for me during my Erasmus Semester in Paris. She showed me the whole 10th arrondissement in the Parisian way and introduced me to so many places I’ve never been before. I loved the breakfast on the weekends that we enjoyed together with Philippe and the Apéros in the evenings. It was the perfect possibility for me to improve my French and get to know the Parisian life better.\nThe apartment was very clean and fitted perfectly for two people. The room is very calm because its window is on the courtyard side. It’s perfectly located, near the two stations (Gare de l’Est + Gare du Nord) where you can take the metro or the RER to the University Sorbonne or you can take the Metro nr. 7 at Poissonnière to the center of Paris (Louvre, Opera,..) and you can even walk to the center in 20 min., to Montmartre in 15 min. or along the Canal Saint-Martin that is just 5 min. away. It’s surrounded by everything you need: supermarket, Boulangerie, market, shops,…\nI will remember this time always because Philippe and Martina were so amazing with me. I’m looking forward to many more evenings together! Thank you for everything!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T17:52:39.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

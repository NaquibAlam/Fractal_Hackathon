I read a lot so I like to buy books at a discounted price. Thrift books has been a life saver! I love that I get free shipping on all my orders (I never order less than 3 books so I always hit the $10/free shipping). My favorite thing is the reading rewards. What other book store or site will give you coupons for 1/10th of what you spend on books? I've earned and used 3 reading rewards coupons over the last 3 weeks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:13:45.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

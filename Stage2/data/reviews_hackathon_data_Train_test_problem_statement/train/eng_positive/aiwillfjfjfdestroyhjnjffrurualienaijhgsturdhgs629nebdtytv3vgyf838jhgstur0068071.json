I ordered 6 pair of frames to try them before I buy them with optics. The process took a little time bc 2 of the pairs were on backorder, but everything went smoothly. The only two detractors are that: 1) I received no less than 14 emails about the status of my order. While this is annoying, I can't really complain bc I knew what was going on every step of the way. 2) even though they sent the order in 3 different shipments, they waited until The two back ordered glasses came in to send the other four. It was a bit odd, but I can't complain bc of the price. I've had the best experience with them so far so I am ordering my optics with them and returning the glasses that I don't want. I only planned to keep one of the six pairs, but now I've decided to keep two of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T15:16:06.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

She told us about all of the different regions and the different activities that we could. We chose the activities that we wanted to do and she set up the rest. She coordinated it so that we could stay in 2 different hotels for 4 days each with a nice hike during the travel time between the 2 locations. There were people staying where we were that we're trying to find transportation back and forth to each event but all we had to do was wait for ours to show up.\nI can't recommend the service enough. We are going back in May for our second trip and she is handling everything for us once again because of how simple she made it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T23:18:47.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

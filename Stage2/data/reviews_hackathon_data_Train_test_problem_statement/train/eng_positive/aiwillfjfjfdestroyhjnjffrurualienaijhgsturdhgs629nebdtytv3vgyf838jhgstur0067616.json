Even though when you sign up it says you will get a certificate.\" ** Since leaving negative feedback with Trust Pilot, I was contacted by the VP of operations Don B. The next business day with a phone call, Email with my Certificate, AND a paper copy in priority 2 day mail headed my way. Not to mention a gift card. Also a long letter explaining everything on the probable mix up that had occurred, and sincere apology. The mix up was at no fault of Corexcel and was due to the publishing company called Cengage and possibly a computer glitch between Corexcel and publishing company Cengage. Unknowingly, i initially called Cengage because their contact info is in the course content and not Corexcels contact info and me being under a severe time crunch, All of which i discussed with Don B, which they are working on to correct. I hate writing bad reviews and i'm really glad that i was able to talk to Don B. and discuss the matter. I have not had a better experience with ANY company on how forthcoming with the want/need to correct and resolve a issue a customer has had. Not to mention a gift card as a added sincere apology. I highly recommend Corexcel courses to anybody that needs certain courses to continue their education. Also i am happy to upgrade my original rating. Thanks again !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T21:10:10.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

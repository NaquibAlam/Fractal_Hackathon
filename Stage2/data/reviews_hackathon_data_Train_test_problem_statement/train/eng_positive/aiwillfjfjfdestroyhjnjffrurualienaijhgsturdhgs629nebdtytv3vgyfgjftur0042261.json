We were building a lakeside cabin, and I wanted to 'hide' the TV in the great room, making it a design element rather than a distraction. Kevin and Randy worked with me patiently and diligently, even searching and finding artwork to match my vision perfectly. They helped me pick out my frame and wood style, and matched my stain perfectly from a wood sample that I provided. When we encountered an unexpected hanging issue, they reworked and reinforced the frame mounting to meet our special needs. I have rarely, if ever, encountered such excellent customer service and responsiveness ... they really care, and want me to be totally happy. And I am ... I recommend FrameMyTV to everyone who visits (after I show off my disappearing artwork)! Totally impressive!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:31:11.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We keep returning because the tile quality is fabulous, the showroom setup gives you good ideas and the staff provide excellent service. They always help us with design ideas, colours and options. We have never been disappointed and the tiles that we choose look as good today as when they were first put up.\nWe have just updated two new bathrooms and the tiles are brilliant. We also always use Porcelanosa adhesive and grout because it then comes with a 10 year guarantee for peace of mind. Thanks Porcelanosa and particularly Mike and Helena in Reading for your great service.\nPaul A Reading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T22:45:46.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

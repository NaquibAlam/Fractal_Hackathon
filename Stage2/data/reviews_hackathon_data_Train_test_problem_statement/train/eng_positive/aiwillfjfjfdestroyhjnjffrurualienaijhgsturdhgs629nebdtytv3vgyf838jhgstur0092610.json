We toured the Amazon on the Amazon Clipper for 6 nights. The boat was perfect for the seeing the river wildlife up close and personal. The staff was exceptional. The food was delicious and homemade at every meal. Our guide Herman was extraordinary. He was very knowledgeable and fun to be around. The trip had an excellent balance of activities and rest time. We were busy but never felt rushed. We also had enough time to relax, take a nap, read a book or play card games.\nI would HIGHLY recommend this trip to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:45:01.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

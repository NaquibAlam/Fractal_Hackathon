Also gave us some ideas for future orders. Loved the mock up product emailed through to us as well. Totally hassle-free process from initial order to delivery of final product. Lisa was responsive, answered all my questions clearly and made the whole order and payment process simple. Fantastic turnaround time - final product was on my desk 5 working days from payment - exactly as advertised!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:10:57.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

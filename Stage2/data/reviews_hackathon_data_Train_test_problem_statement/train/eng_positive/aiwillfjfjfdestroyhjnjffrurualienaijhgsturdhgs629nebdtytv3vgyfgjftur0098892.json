There is no guarantee you will get that seat.\nThey do offer an insurance option but it would have been easier to make a decision, whether or not to get it, if the price (or an estimate of the price) was there. So I declined that option (will get that elsewhere).\nYou can choose a meal preference (e.g. vegetarian, Kosher, gluten free etc). This works well if you want the same thing for both flights.\nThe price was good. I will know more after I have taken the flight and see that it all works smoothly - then I'll post again.\nI have a print out of my booking - I assume that's all I need when I arrive at the airport. It did not actually tell you this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:54:54.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

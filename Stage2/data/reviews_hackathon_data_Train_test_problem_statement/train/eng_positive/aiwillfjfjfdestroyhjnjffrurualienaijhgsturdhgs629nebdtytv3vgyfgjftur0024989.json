Not only did I get the book that I wanted (used), but it arrived in excellent condition, in quite a timely fashion and the price was well beyond reasonable. I also like the fact that their data base has a tally of many other (hard to find) books which conversely offers the option of receiving email alerts if and when they come across any available copies of the aforementioned.In short: reading is food for the brain and - in some cases- the soul and It's a breath of fresh air to know that there are still those out there that mean to keep this valued part of the human learning experience alive, especially in a time rife with distractions (i.e. social media, television with its' asinine reality shows and any multitude of other time wasting activities) it's heart-warming to be able to still find ways to enjoy the tactile experience of cracking open a \"real\" book versus staring at a tablet and fatiguing your poor eyes. Whew. That was longer than I meant to type. I'm just a very passionate person about books and knowledge in general.\nPeace and Harmony to all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:35:14.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

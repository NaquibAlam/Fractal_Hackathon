You can sort whatever city and neighborhood you are looking in and it will sort and find a list of sitters for you. There are profiles of sitter and house, restrictions, customer reviews for each sitter, price, and experience. All sitters I have used have been pretty wonderful, and it is so much more relaxing to know you are leaving your beloved pet with a caretaker in a home, rather than a boarding facility.

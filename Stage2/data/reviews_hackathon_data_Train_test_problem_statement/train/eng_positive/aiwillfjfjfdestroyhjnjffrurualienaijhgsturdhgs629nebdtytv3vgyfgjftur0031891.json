My only critique so far would be the vegetable in my first order were a bit overcooked. Other than that, the salmon was delicious, the delivery was made in a timely manner, the driver was courteous and professional, and the portion size was perfect for me. For those who have really big appetites, you may want to order a side dish. I can't wait to try my next delivery, and hope the food will be just as flavorful as my first order. I will definitely be ordering from here again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:28:41.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

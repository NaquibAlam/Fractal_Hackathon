The team are fantastic at getting what we need, and even sometimes helping us find things they don't usually stock. The product quality is fantastic, and we often order made-to-suit electrical and data cabling which is perfect and very high quality. Their shipping is second to none - from metro same-day jobs to mine sites in the middle of nowhere, it's all been spot on, on time. One single incident amongst hundreds of flawless orders, where a problem with a courier's driver left us short of cabling to finish a critical job - our account manager Okan went the extra mile late on a weekend to get the package found and delivered ASAP. The team have always been awesome to deal with, very friendly and willing to help. Thanks 4cabling!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:55:46.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It opens you up to a network of people from all over the world! It's pretty easy to use and good value for money compared to some sites where you pay a daily rate.The onus is still on you as the home-owner (and as a house-sitter too I think!) to ensure you due your due diligence and choose wisely. I think establishing your expectations and that of the house-sitter upfront is really important to ensure no disappointment (e.g. do you expect your sitter to be self-sufficient, or are you happy to assist with transport if they are travelling), other than that, so far gut instinct and reviews have had us have one awesome sitter after another. So thank you :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:45:56.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

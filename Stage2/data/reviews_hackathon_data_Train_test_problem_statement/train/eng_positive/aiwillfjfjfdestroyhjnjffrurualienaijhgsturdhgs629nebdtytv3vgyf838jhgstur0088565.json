I found stockwiseauto.com to have the best prices online and better than the local auto parts stores. I purchased a set of strut/spring assemblies for a 2003 Nissan Altima. Shipping was about 5 business days. One of the packages arrived damaged while the other was impeccable. I was a bit concerned with the damaged package, but upon inspection I found the strut to be in good condition except that the brake line bracket was bent a bit. It wasn't severe and I was able to massage it back into place. I believe the packaging could have been a little better, but I also believe the shipping company could have been more careful with package. The parts were nearly identical to the OEM parts and I had no issues with fitment or installation. I would recommend stockwiseauto and would shop there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:29:24.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

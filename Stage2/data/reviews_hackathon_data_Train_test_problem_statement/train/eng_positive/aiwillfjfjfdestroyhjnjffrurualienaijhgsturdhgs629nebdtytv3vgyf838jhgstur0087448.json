I emailed TShirt Studio, they responded within an hour or so and arranged (without any issue) to send out an alternative size. It arrived the next day.\nAll companies should work like this, I will be glad to carry on buying from here with this level of customer service.\nThank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T22:07:35.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The $5 coupons for every $50 of books purchased is an added bonus and I have earned ten or more of them over time. I look at the site nearly everyday and when I did have a question, I always received a timely and detailed response from the company.\nMy one caveat is that until a couple of months ago, I checked everyday the new arrivals in the history category which numbered 150 - 200 daily. However, now when I click on New Arrivals, over 10,000 come up which makes browsing through all the New Arrivals impossible and much less enjoyable. Even though I look up books using keywords, it was always fun to find a gem in the New Arrivals that I might not have been looking for otherwise.\nHowever, I still love the site, especially the means to create a Wish List.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:46:05.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

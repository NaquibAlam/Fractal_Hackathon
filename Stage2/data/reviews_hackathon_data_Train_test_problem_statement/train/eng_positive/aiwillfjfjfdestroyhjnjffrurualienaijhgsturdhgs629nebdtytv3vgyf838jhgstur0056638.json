It was so easy to set up and use. We love having the fobs allowing us to arm or disarm the alarm with the push of a button. Also great to be able to do the same using our smartphones from anywhere ( as we discovered on our recent trip to Mexico)!\nReally happy that it's a wireless system. We highly recommend Think Protection!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T19:44:03.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

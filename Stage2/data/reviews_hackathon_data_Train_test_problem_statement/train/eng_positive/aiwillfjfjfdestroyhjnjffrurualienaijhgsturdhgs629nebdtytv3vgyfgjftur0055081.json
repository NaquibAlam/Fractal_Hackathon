Their prices are a good few euro cheaper than the healthfood stores here in Dublin so I decided to order my shopping with them. The order took about 9 days to get to us as they decided to wait until one of the items was in stock before shipping the whole order. This was the only minus point thus 4 stars. I will probably order from them again as they stock some hard to find brands and items not usually found in the other shops.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:43:05.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

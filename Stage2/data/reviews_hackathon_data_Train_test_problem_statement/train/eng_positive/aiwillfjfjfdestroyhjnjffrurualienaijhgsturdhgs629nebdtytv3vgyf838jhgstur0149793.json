I had to do this because of poor relationship decisions and I was happy with my current lender. So after weeks of getting the runaround from other companies I finnaly spoke with Miss Romona and litteraly all I had to do was answer a few questions send an email or two with my current insurance and registration and everything else was taken care of. I expressed I only wanted to deal with a reputable lender even if that meant I didn't go with the best deal but I was set up with Chartway Federal Credit Union and they have been great. There customer service is awesome and was even able to save some money in the process. Miss Romona was in constant contact with me even from her personal cell phone after work hours when I had questions and that speaks volumes to me that I was not just another number to her. I NEVER leave reviews and I was so anxious and skeptical of this entire process at first I was extremely worried that something would go wrong or I would end up being screwed over, but it honestly could not have gone better and I'm absolutely relieved!! The only downfall I saw was a hefty service fee that was tacked onto the new loan that I was not informed Chartway would be adding to the coast of the loan, but I had no other option but to refinance my car and I would rather pay that fee and know I'm in good hands then to be screwed in the long run. Again very happy and if for some reason I am ever in need of refinancing again I will certainly be back to speak with Miss Romona!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T05:02:16.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

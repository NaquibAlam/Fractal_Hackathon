How right I was ! Very clear and easy to use website, even with my lack of expertise. My design had 3 lines on the front and all the family names on the back so a lot of printing. The cost per T-shirt came out at just less than Â£12 which I thought was exceptional value especially considering the quality of the garments. First class service throughout and will definitely use again .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T23:09:13.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

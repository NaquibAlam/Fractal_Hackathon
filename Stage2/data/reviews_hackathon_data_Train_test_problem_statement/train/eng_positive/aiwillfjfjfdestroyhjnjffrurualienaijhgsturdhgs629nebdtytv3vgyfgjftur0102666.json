The owner Margaret made us feel very welcome. The information pack had everything we needed to care for and enjoy her lovely comfortable home (with every mod con) the sparkling pool and the beautiful grounds and gardens. Margaret also gave us all the information we needed to explore the surrounding towns of Tamworth, Gunnedah, Coonabarabran, Willow Tree and Murrurrundi. This house sitting opportunity gives both international and Aussie housesitters an insight into daily life on a large working property surrounded by fields stretching to the distant mountains. We loved every minute of our time at Spring Ridge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:47:19.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

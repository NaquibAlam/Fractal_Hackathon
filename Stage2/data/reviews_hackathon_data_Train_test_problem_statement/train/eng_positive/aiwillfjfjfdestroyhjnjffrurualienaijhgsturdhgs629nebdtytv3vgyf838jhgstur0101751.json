I watched an excellent You Tube video on troubleshooting but I still did not have success. I called and actually spoke to same guy who made video (sorry - his name escapes me). His assistance went far beyond my expectations. In the end with his help I ordered a new kit (receiver and remote). He explained when order would ship, how and expected arrival date. Kit arrived just as he predicted. Before I replaced receiver I tried remote straight out of the box and it worked! EXCELLENT. I also have a spare receiver should the need...

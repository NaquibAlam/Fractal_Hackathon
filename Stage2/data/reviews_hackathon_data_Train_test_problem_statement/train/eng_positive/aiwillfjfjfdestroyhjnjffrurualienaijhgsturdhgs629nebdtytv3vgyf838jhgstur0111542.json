I think that's a good thing for bike path safety reasons; sometimes I pedal under my own steam at 27km/h for a bit of extra exercise. People who normally ride along at +30km/h might find this frustrating because their bike is now 7kg heavier but not giving any power. Pick the right kit for your needs.\nDropping down some gears and putting in more of your own effort for hill climbs, take offs, and spending a bit of time above 25km/h means I can get two return trips to work (~60km), instead of the 1.25 return trips when I was mucking around exploring the battery and the control system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T18:25:45.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I primarily needed the information off the two drives because they contained my research for my game development. I stumbled across Secure Data Recovery Services while researching a lab to send my drives to online. The customer service there was fantastic. After receiving my request, Mitchell Moore contacted me further with excellent assistance throughout the whole process. Mitchell and his team were able to provide diagnostics and discovered that the Read/ Write Heads were torn and bent. Unfortunately, they had to address the issues in a clean room where both the hard drives were imaged. After the imaging process was complete, the RAID was reassembled into the correct configuration and the data was extracted. After the information was extracted, my data was transferred into an external hard drive and shipped back to me through FedEx. The entire recovery process took less time than I expected. Not only did I get my research back, but all of my data was recovered. I feel like I got my lifeâ€™s history back. So if you are someone or if you know someone with a RAID 0 hard drive failure, I highly recommend contacting Secure Data Recovery Services in a heartbeat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:06:25.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

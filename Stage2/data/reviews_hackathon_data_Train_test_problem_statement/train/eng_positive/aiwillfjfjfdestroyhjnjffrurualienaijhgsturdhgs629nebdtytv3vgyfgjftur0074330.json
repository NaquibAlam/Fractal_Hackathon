Was very skeptical at first because you always hear about people getting scammed. Looked up Ace ticket and found they've been in business for a while. Plus they're local in the Boston area so I felt comfortable purchasing from them! The process was simple and very quick! Received my ticket in the mail early. I will be purchasing my Boston sports tickets from Ace from now on!! Thanks and go Patriots!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:43:52.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

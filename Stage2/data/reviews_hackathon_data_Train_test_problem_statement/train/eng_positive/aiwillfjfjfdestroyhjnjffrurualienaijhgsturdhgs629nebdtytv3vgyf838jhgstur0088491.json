I was so lucky I made the decision to go with her right away. She has a beautiful, dog-friendly area where dogs are safe to have fun and play outside yet stay warm & able to snuggle inside. She treated my Luella like a princess. I went to meet Claire and her husband before confirming my Luella would stay with them. Between them both, I could not have been blessed with two nicer, dog-loving, responsible people to watch my dog. It was the first time I ever left her so I was sad and nervous. Claire sent me updates everyday starting first thing in the morning during my vacation without Luella. She sent cute photos, videos, and well-written summaries of their day. She also gave Luella her vitamins, probiotics and food exactly how I had instructed. Any supplies Luella needed more of, Claire went out & purchased & supplied me with an itemized receipt for any of these items she purchased out of pocket for my baby. I cannot recommend her enough. Luella came back just as happy as ever with no change in her personality or love for me...which was a concern. (I am extremely fussy who I let around my dog.) Luella and I look very forward to seeing her again soon. Can't say it enough: CLAIRE IS PERFECTION....responsible, kind, caring, reliable, honest, trustworthy, intelligent and an amazing listener....as well as a woman who is fantastic with dogs. It was an honor having her watch my dog.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T13:21:23.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Beyond the products, the site really helps manage what you ordered and/or have in your cart. I cannot tell you how helpful that spreadsheet is to check off duplicates.\nTime your orders wisely! Some come early, some right on time. Keep an eye out for their CNYE closures.\nThe shipping and handling DOES hurt a bit and at times it bites into what you save...but honestly the selection, quantities and quality are worth it. A lot of what they offer I find in my country heavily marked up. Doing the math...with shipping you ended up saving with the bulk orders rather than a bunch of small ones where there is NO promise of the color or size plus individual shipping over and over.\nYou can trust this company. They'll contact you if there are problems as well.

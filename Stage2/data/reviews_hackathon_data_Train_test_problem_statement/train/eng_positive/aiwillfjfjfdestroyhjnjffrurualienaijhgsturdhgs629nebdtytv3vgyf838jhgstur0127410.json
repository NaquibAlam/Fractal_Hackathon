I selected the option for the trees to be delivered in the spring. I live in Maryland, and the trees arrived in early March. The whole order arrived in one narrow/long box that I was not sure would contain all I had ordered, but I needn't have worried. All trees were bound securely together inside bubble wrap with roots wrapped up in a plastic bag containing some sort of hydrating gel medium. The 5-6' saplings were pruned essentially branchless, the chestnut saplings bore 4-5 branches each. All trees were dormant but alive and healthy by all appearances. I was able to plant them the next day, and as far as I can tell now (nearly 3 weeks later) they are still alive but have yet to show any further outward signs of activity/growth. I expect they may remain like this for another week or three. All in all I am so far very pleased with my experience with Willis Orchards, their website was easy to navigate, their stock seems good and of good quality, and what service I have received has been good. Hopefully the trees will continue to do well though if they don't at this point it would likely be the weather's or my own fault.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T09:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T08:48:25.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Being a young couple, we had a strict budget, but never felt pressure to spend more than we were comfortable with. The design process was really fun to go through. We always felt in control, but when we needed guidance, our designer was there to help. My favorite part was the wax model, it's so helpful to see the ring and hold it before giving the final go-ahead. I never thought I could get a completely custom ring and still stay within budget. I loved everything about this process!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:42:28.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

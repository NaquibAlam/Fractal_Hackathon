The whole experience was a delight and very customer focused. The process for selling my watch was quick, simple and clear. It was the first time I had bought a pre-owned watch and I was very (very) impressed with the condition of both. The website has all the information you need and the team at Watchfinder are very proactive after the sale, calling to confirm the shipping preferences and following up by email to confirm all is ok. I would also highlight the great experience I had with Luke Johnston and Bryony Gammon. I managed to scratch one of the watches I bought on the first day I had it (!) and the Watchfinder team were brilliant in getting it polished and back to me within a week. I strongly recommend this company for its great service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:25:31.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Wow, I'm am so impressed with everything about this company. A beautiful puzzle with strong pieces and beautiful vibrant colors. My first WM puzzle was the Van Gogh collage. The pieces were in great condition, out of 1,000 pieces, maybe five had a little bend due to shipping I guess. I just pressed them and they lay flat. The pieces are so well cut that it's very clear if a piece is in the right spot, either it fits perfectly or it's not the right one. I also want to mention the great customer service. From the start, WMP was interested in whether I was happy w my order. And when I thought I was missing a piece, they helped me out immediately. (I found the piece.) I just finished my second puzzle, a beach house w covered porch, and it's more beautiful than it looks in the picture. Can't wait to start another one. I highly recommend these puzzles and this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T10:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:08:16.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

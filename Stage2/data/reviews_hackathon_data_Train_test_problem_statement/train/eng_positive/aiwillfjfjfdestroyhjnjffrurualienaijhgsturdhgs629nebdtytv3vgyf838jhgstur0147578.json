I have a wedding to attend\nin Toronto that weekend and went to look for affordable fair as things are\nin process. lol. financially. Going through a divorce. So that I got\na ticket for just over $400 from Edmonton, excited me! And I booked it.\nHowever, when I got my electronic ticket and saw the airport name,\nonly then it dawned on me its not in Toronto and Im flying to Hamilton.\nSo the down side is when I searched flights to Toronto, and the fact that I don't know Ontario at all, made an error myself. Hope I can resolve it. They seem like a wonderful company and I would recommend them to anyone.\nPerhaps if I get the credit for this review, I can change my ticket without switching fees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T08:21:57.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I placed an order with FolderPrinters and the rest is history. I had questions even before I confirmed our order online and when I called their contact line, I was greeted by Michael, an actual human. So often, contact line numbers go to automated voicemail systems. Michael was courteous, helpful, and answered all my questions fully. Once the order was placed, a proof was sent over for review. I called again to ask for changes with the proof, and once again, my query was addressed in full by another one of the great FolderPrinters staff. When the folders arrived, they were beautiful, the white linen tastefully offsetting our silver foil logo in the bottom righthand corner, just as our final proof depicted. This review was verbose but bottom line - great customer service, fine end product.

I want to tell you that Gino the assistant manager has been way more than helpful with all of my problems over the last year's. That is not to say that his crew does not deserve the congratulations that are due to him as well. Now this is the second time I have tried to send you accolades including these people who are in no way related to me and who have just helped out a poor old guy needing some tires. Jeff is also one Worthy of accolades as well as Ricky, I hope I have that name right. I certainly wish that you would take this into consideration, and please Advance their careers accordingly. If everyone in all services acted this way, then we could be proud all of us as well, in knowing that customer service, kindness, compassion, has not failed. Should you need any further information, you may contact me at anytime.Shawn Paskiewich. 2035568415.

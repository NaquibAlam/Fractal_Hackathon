I also phoned and got very good service. My one suggestion is to make the pick up/drop off location of the car more clear. I had a bad experience once and therefore called to check this. As it turned out, the booking I was about to make was for cars that were not at the airport but about 10 minutes away. There was a shuttle but it did not operate at the times we needed. I ended up paying more to be able to pick up and drop off at the airport. I did not have an issue with the pricing related to the airport location but I would have been really unhappy had I booked the lowest price option and then discovered the problem with the shuttle.\nEverything else was great.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:03:05.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

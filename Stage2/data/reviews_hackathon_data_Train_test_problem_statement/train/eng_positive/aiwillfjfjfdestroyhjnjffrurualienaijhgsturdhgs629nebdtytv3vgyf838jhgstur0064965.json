But being Prada meant it didn't fit my budget: $349 for the frames. Thankfully with good vision insurance and in-network benefits, the Prada frames came down to $153.30. But I still needed to purchase progressive lenses with anti-reflective coating made the total frame and lens package $421.20. So I decided to look online and found Otticanet and my beloved Prada frames for $164.00 with a 10% discount for $147.60 + free shipping. And since I was able to apply a $45 out-of-network insurance benefit, the Prada frames ended up to be $102.60. So it was a no-brainer to try Otticanet. And I couldn't be happier! The frames arrived from Italy within a few days in it's gorgeous packaging so I knew they were authentic Prada. I recommend Otticanet to others, but I also recommend they know exactly the size of frames to order. As for purchasing lenses, I am more cautious. I still prefer taking the frames to a local optical lab since I have progressives and customer service is able to measure my eyes on the spot. But I may change my mind in the future if I become more familiar with that process.\nUPDATE: A few days after I posted this review, I received a $20.00 invoice from FedEx for an \"Ancillary Service Fee—charged by the broker when additional processing is required by a regulatory agency or our customs broker. We may apply and invoice for these fees which are subject to change, for either U.S.- or non-U.S. entries\". The FedEx agent said I could fill out a form on Ottica.net website to try to be reimbursed from Ottica.net The FedEx agent was very helpful in finding me the form. I scanned and submitted my FedEx invoice. But when I hit \"submit\" the Ottica.net webpage posted \"500 Internal Server Error — Really sorry, something went wrong! Our team has been alerted of the issue and some of our best engineers are looking into it immediately.\" I tried submitting the form again and got the same message. I am hoping Ottica.net got my information and I will be reimbursed. I will check back with an update.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T11:43:59.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

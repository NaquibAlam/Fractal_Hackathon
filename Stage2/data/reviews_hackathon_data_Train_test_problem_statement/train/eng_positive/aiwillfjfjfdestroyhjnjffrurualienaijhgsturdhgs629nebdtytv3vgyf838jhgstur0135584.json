Nothing got spilled or broken and the box was sent in a waterproof bag so I did not have to worry about getting delivery dropped at my front door. In addition the order was shipped very quickly. I have to say it's the best experience I ever got in my 10 years of online shopping. I will definitely order DIOR products at DIOR website from now on instead of ordering from department stores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:08:57.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The cost was very affordable. When my boiler developed a fault one quick phonecal and an engineer was asked to call. The engineer arrived quickly and found the problem. He made sure that I would be OK with a tempary fix, whilst he got the OK to carry on and to get the required part. He arrived with the part a day or two later and within a short time had my heating on. He cleaned up after himself and having one last look to see if he had left anything, he left.\nI am very pleased that I took out the CorgiHomePlan and have no hesitation in recommending it.

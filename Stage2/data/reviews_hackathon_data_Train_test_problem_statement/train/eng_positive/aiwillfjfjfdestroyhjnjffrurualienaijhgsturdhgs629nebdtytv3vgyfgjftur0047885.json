Maybe you're not sure if the products are genuine, if your order will get \"lost in the mail\" or perhaps you have some other concern. And if you're anything like me, you've now read some great reviews, and some REALLY bad ones... leaving you no better off on deciding what to do.\nI was the same. I researched several sites, all had mixed reviews. The sunglasses I wanted weren't sold anywhere in Sydney, so I had no choice but to buy the online.\nI wasn't sure if I could trust Vision Direct or not, I was scared that I'd buy a pair of fakes and be stuck with them. But there was only one way to find out, so I took the plunge, placed my order (Dolce & Gabbana) and paid $20 insurance (for replacement of products up to $600) just in case anything went wrong.\nI started to get a bit worried when I didn't receive a confirmation of order email for a day or two after placing it, but when that came I felt better. If I had to complain about one thing, it's that the next part of the process took longer than it should have. But still, it only took about 7 days for VD to ship my sunnies - which was fine because I was prepared for it to take a month (based on other reviews).\nThe sunglasses were delivered by DHL Courier. I wasn't home to collect the delivery so they took it back to the depot and I was able to collect it after work - no hassle.\nUnboxing the sunglasses revealed all packaging to be intact with all the tags, plastic coverings, warranties and certificates of authenticity also there. Despite my reservations, the glasses are certainly genuine, frames and lenses are amazing quality (the lens even has the unique item code proving it's authenticity). Absolutely love them.\nAll in all, I had a good to very good experience using Vision Direct and would happily recommend the site to a friend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:39:53.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

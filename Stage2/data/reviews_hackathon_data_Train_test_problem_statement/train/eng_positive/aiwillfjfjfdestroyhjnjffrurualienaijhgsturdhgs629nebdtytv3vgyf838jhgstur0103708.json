From the moment the booking was made until returning home, Bench took care of everything and customer service was second to none. Upon returning home I even received a Welcome Home email.\nAny questions that were asked prior to travel were answered within a timely manner and addressed accordingly. Their travel documentation is so personalised and themed accordingly for the destination. It was truly exciting to receive the docs and you could smell Africa in the document wallet.\nThroughout travel in Africa everything ran smoothly. As we moved from place to place, all transfers were well organised and we effortlessly moved from one accommodation to another. Everything that was outlined in our itinerary, we did.\nOur first resting place was Camp Jabulani. Exceptional elegance & luxury. Have never been accommodated with such personal, intimate details. The chef even personally introduces himself to you and outlines the menu. Rooms and facilities were amazing. Guides very interesting.\nMakutsi Safari Springs is a perfect 3.5 star property well designed for all ages and very affordable. Their food was delicious and created daily. They provide plenty of tour and game drive options for a week long stay.\nShumbalala, located in Thornybush Private Reserve was completely out of this world. Luxury, elegance, sophistication, 5 star +++, completely surrounded by the African bush. First impressions were flawless. Upon arrival receive a meet & greet by the manager with welcome drinks and warm refreshing towels. Little touches are perfected here. From the infinity pool to the paved sitting area, lounge area, indoor sitting area and fire place...there isn't a thing they haven't thought about. The food is first class and so is their service. And then there are the rooms...speechless!!! Their guides are superb. They asked what we wanted to see and they delivered. We were lucky, but they did their best to ensure we saw what we wanted. Very approachable and personality plus.\nThornybush Game Lodge is a 5 star property that excels in luxury, bush living. The rooms and food here were also exquisite. Guides & trackers here are also fantastic. Highly recommend.\nThe Palace at Sun City is incredible. Old World charm and elegance. Very family friendly and well catered. Very spacious rooms. Service second to none.\nBench Africa certainly do go the extra mile to ensure they are delivering an exceptional product to their customers. And that they did!!! They know their product more than anybody else in the marketplace and this ensures if customers travel with Bench, they will experience a once in a lifetime holiday like I did.\nThank-you Bench. This African experience has moved me forever.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:23:35.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Made direct deposit at bank Tuesday lunch time and had parcel by 2pm Wednesday. Fast service with conformation emails every step of the way so I knew exactly what was happening and when. My daughter was very happy with the case and the choice of colours she could have had. Much better range than the phone accessory place at our local shops. Nice to see a good range of colours available, many more than other online stores I looked at (most only had black) especially when it was for a girl and that it wasn't an iPhone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T11:45:58.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Assuming I can measure my artwork correctly, everything else is a breeze. Many, many framing options, but all have worked perfectly for me. My only \"complaint' concerns the packaging; those old-fashioned copper staples sure do secure the package but are a bear to remove. Wish they'd consider another option. When other vendors are doing everything they can to minimize the packaging--and its associated cost--American Frame does everything possible to ensure that their orders arrive safely.

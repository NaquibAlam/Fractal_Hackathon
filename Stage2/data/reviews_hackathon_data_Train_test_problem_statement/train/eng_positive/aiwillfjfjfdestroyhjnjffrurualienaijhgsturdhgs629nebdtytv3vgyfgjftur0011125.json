I was surprised at how everything shipped in it's own box; however, everything arrived cold, the ham and hen still frozen and we have friends who were excited to be able to reuse the coolers and ice packs.\nWe have yet to try more than just two of the products order, so far. very tasty, nice cuts of meat with just enough fat left on for flavor. I would definitely recommend Burgers' for smokehouse products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T18:08:40.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

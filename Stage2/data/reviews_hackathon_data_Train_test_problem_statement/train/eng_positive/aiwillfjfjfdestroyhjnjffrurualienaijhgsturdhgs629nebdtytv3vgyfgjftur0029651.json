I was met by Charles Spivey who was friendly and professional. He went out of his way to listen to what I wanted and help me to get the vehicle that I wanted. I had friends who've used them and I took a chance. I was all set to sign the papers and the night before the deal was supposed to be done, I located a better deal. I arrived to change everything and surprisingly enough, they were very helpful and understanding. I couldn't have been more pleased. I drove off in my dream car.

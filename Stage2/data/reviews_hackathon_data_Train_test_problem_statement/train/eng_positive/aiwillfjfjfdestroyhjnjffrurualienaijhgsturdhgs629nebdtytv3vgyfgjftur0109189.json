As I am sure you are aware, in my state (Idaho) it is illegal to utilize any cannabis related medicine that has too much THC (more than .09% THC is illegal here, I believe).\nMy daughter, Hannah, has a form of epilepsy that does not always respond well to pharmaceutical medications (especially emergency rescue medicines used during a grand mal seizure). I ordered some CBD crystals from your San Diego office and I spoke with an extremely professional and compassionate person (I forgot her name). The CBD crystals arrived quickly, securely and packaged exactly as you described.\nTo make her emergency seizure rescue medicine, I mix the CBD crystals in a and put that solution into a . Two days ago my daughter had a grand mal seizure. The CBD solution that I created, with your crystals, was able to completely stop her seizure in 3 minutes and 21 seconds!! Trust me, for Hannah, that was miraculous.\nAND her post-seizure period (postictal state) which can be anywhere from 60 minutes to several hours was less than 15 minutes\nAs a father, I am so grateful for what your company is doing. As a citizen of humanity, I am so angry at my government for stating that this plant has NO medicinal value. I am a Christian, a husband, the father of four, and a US air force retiree. It is for these reasons I write this review. I am a normal, completely sober parent who is 'shouting', \"this has worked for Hannah's epilepsy and maybe it could help your child too\"--I do NOT know, I am NOT a physician, I am just a parent sharing our fantastic news.\nI have a deep gratitude for you all. I am forever grateful. And have already placed my next order!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:41:44.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

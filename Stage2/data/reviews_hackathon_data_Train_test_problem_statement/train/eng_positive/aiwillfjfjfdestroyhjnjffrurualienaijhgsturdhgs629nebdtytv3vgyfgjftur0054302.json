A good friend recommended Rover.com...and I couldn't have been more pleased.\nWe found a great local sitter near out house. We were able to do a house visit with our dog, and the sitter kept us up to date on how our dog was doing the whole time we were gone. I am so glad I was able to use this service to find a great local sitter versus a kennel. She gave great attention to my dog while we were gone. We wouldn't have been able to do this without having Rover as a tool to find a sitter.\nThanks!

I had issues downloading the photos on my media card, and exhausted all available methods photographers use. I was ready to give up and trash the CF media card. My mom was later diagnosed with terminal cancer, and I decided to pay to get the images recovered from that trip (where I took lots of photos of my mom). I was very satisfied with DriveSavers because I initially thought I had lost about 1,500 photos, but it was over 3,000. It was a lot of data to recover, and even though some photos were unrecoverable, I was very satisfied with the whole process. They even issued a mailing label so that all I had to do was take the CF card to a Fed Ex store and have them package the CF card. At the end, I received the corrupt CF card (which had to be \"dissected\"), and a thumb drive onto which they added all the JPEGS they were able to recover. I can't deny it was a bit expensive, but it was worth all the aggravation I would have had to go through asking \"professional IT\" friends and family, what to do to resolve my issue. I would do it again if I had to! They do have a policy that if they can't recover anything on whatever storing device you submit, they won't charge you! Where else would you get that sort of a deal?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:09:27.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

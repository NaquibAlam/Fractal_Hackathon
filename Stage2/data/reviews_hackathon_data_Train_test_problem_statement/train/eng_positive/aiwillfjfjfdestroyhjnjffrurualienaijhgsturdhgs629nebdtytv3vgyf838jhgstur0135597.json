Sadly I hadnt done my homework on India but have done a lot of reading since. Intrepid ensure they stick to their values and guiding principals so I have no complaints there. The challenge comes from the clash of my individualist Western eyes judging the Indian collective society in this transitional phase of their history to a global economy! Yes, it is complicated! I kept thinking \"Why is your health system so bad? Why is your infrastructure crumbling? You provide my country with its doctors and engineers for God's sake!\"\nNow, from a distance I appreciate that they value family above everything and that is not such a bad thing.\nI will return and experience India with less judgemental eyes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:37:50.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

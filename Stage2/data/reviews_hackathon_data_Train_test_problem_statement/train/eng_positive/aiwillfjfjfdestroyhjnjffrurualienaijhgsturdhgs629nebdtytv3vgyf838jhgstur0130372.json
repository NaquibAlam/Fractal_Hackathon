The countries we visited, people met were amazing. Amazing memories visiting Tikal ruins, ATM cave tours and islands in Belize.\nHowever some aspects of the tour were disappointing. The tour guide was okay and polite but could have been better in some situations . There was one occasion where we were stuck at the Belize- Mexico border for 7 hours with no food, the van had no aircon ,we didnt know where to go to stamp our passports . The guide should have had local knowledge that it was Mexico's black Friday and maybe could have arranged a better mode of transportation and known where to go to get our passports stamped. That was also the day that our hotel was changed last minute and even the guide did not know this so we ended up having a horrendous day that started at 5 am and ended at 10 pm . Some of the vendors used were asking for tips even before they had provided any service which was ridiculous. Other small instances were hotels that had sub par rooms . I think for the price paid we didnt get the level of comfort expected.\nThe fellow travellers were amazing mix of people from all age brackets, the memories made un erasable and we are still in touch with a few of them 6 months after the tour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T09:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:38:55.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

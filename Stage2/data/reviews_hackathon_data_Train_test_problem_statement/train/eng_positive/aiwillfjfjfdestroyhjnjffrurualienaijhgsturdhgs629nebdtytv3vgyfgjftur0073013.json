Edenia, her lovely mother and family did everything to make us feel welcome to their home. Helped us with tours, taxi collectivos and even arranged a private salsa lesson on the house's front porch.\nThe room was comfortable, nice and clean, breakfast delicious and the nights we had dinner in the casa, the food was delicious, abundant and very typical Cuban.\nThe neighbourhood felt safe and located just a few blocks from central Vinales.\nWe highly recommend you to stay with Edenia!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:10:27.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

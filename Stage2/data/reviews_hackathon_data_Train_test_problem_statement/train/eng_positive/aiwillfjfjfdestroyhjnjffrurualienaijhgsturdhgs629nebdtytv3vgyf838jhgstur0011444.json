Asia, Australia and New Zealand. There were 3 children under 12 in our party so the trip had to keep them active, learning and amazed. It did that with flying colours. By working with our Goway travel agent Bijal Kana we were to do everything we wanted and her suggestions only made it better. The guides in all the countries we visited were not only knowledgeable, engaging, funny and informative but became an integral part of our journey. Our children were always waiting to see who the next guide would be and enjoyed the traveling experience a lot more. They were ready to learn and be more engaged when a guide was looking after us. For the most part the accommodations were as expected and a couple were far above what we thought they would be. The food, restaurants and cruise in China were fantastic. We were very fortunate that our tour group was accommodating and friendly. We have stayed in touch with each one of them and they all made the trip so much more enjoyable. I would highly recommend anyone to contact Goway Travel about their travel adventures and ideas. The Goway Team is second to none.

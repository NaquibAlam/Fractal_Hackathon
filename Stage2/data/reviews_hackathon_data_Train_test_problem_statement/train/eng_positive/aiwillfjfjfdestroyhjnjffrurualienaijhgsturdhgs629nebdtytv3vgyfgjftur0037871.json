I was going to do what I had to do to help her get better and if insurance could help, then that would be a bonus. Well, they came through with the coverage! No arguments, no hassle! The customer service is always super friendly (that's you, Katie), and the coverage is EXTREMELY affordable! I've had pets for most of my life, but this is the first pet insurance I've ever purchased because it's the only one I've ever seen that seemed worthwhile. Now I know from experience that it is TOTALLY worth it! Great job, Figo!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T14:26:26.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

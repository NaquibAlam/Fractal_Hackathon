I was late in making my decision on a gift and was afraid it would not arrive on time. It arrived not only on time but early with no special mailing requests. Upon the gifting to my friend who is technically challenged I read the easy to read instructions and was able to show my friend how to use the vaporizer with no problem. I would recommend the the V5.0S vaporizer based on the reasonable price and my friends satisfaction with the product. The only thing I would have liked better is if the site had made a recommendation for the \"Load X Grinder\" that was more visible at the time of ordering. I\nI'm sure I probably would have purchased that as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:38:01.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The website was very user-friendly, and I had no problems navigating it on both my computer and iphone. Getting Quote: s for term life insurance was simple and Quotacy identified carriers I would not have identified on my own. The Quotacy agent I was assigned was very helpful and responsive to all my questions, but not pushy. It took some time for the carrier I chose to receive my medical records from my doctor, and the Quotacy agent checked in with me to keep me apprised of the process and later provided additional Quote: s for different terms at my request. Great customer service! I put off purchasing life insurance because the process was intimidating and my home/auto carrier was pushy in following up with me about an initial Quote: . Quotacy made the process easier and made me feel like I was more in control of the process. Ultimately, the rate I received from the lowest-cost carrier Quotacy identified was $10/month lower than what I was Quote: d by my home/auto carrier for the same term. I had a great experience with Quotacy and would recommend the company to anyone interested in life insurance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:51:36.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

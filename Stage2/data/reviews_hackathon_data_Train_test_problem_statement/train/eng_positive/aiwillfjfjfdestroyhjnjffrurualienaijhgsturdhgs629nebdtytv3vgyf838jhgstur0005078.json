Be prepared to be flexible. !! Goway did a good job !\nWould not recommend stopping in Blenheim to view the wine country. While our bike trip through the vineyards was very short but well run, the town itself is just a farming outpost..no charm , and our hotel The Hotel D'Urville located in the middle of a depressed business district, was billed as \"charming\" ,but filled with uncomfortable antique furniture and worn carpets. We were very disappointed when management bumped us for a pre booked 8PM dinner downstairs after our arrival, as they were hosting a large catered $$group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:58:10.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

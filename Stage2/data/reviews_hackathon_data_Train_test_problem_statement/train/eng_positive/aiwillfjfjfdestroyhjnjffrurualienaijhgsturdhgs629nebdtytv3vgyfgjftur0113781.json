Servicecaster has proved to have the best product, best service, and fastest delivery I have ever experienced. For all this you would expect to pay a premium price, but the pricing is highly competitive, if not less expensive than others. Years ago, I had refused to use another supplier that my supervisor had used before because of the lack of quality. Days later, we had a comparable (size and price) swivel caster sample from Servicecaster. My supervisor lag screwed it to the top of a plywood work table and pounded it with a lump hammer until the lag screws finally snapped. The caster was marred and scratched and still functioned perfectly. We ordered 1,200 instantly and will never use another supplier. My recent small order of two dozen was in my hands 23 hours after I placed the order and Servicecaster kept me informed each step of the way. A superior Company.

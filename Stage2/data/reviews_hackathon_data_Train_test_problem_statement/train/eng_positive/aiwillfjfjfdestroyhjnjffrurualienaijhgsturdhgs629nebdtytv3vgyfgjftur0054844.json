It provided us with a platform from which to launch our wedding invites to friends and family. Keen not to waste paper and send invites out on the road via the Royal Mail we thought this would embrace a 21st century green and cost effective option that would deliver our message instantaneously. We were very impressed with the speed and ease of the software and found it easy to navigate around and design. Once sent it offered instant responses which could then be tracked giving us confidence that guests had received and read our invites. We were also able to ask specific questions about catering requirements etc which meant we could very quickly liaise with our preferred provider giving then up to date changes. The wedding party can also interact and see who has opened the invite, read it and responded to the RSVP, a truly transparent and interactive service. Overall I would fully recommend this company and the service they offer. If you want to embrace the future and move away from 'traditional and sometimes expensive' hard copy invites then use Greenvelope as an efficient and effective alternative. 5 stars!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:12:33.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

As I love the G-Shock brand, the G-Shock MR-G quickly caught my eye. I went on a quest to find this watch: I visited quite some jewelers, though many of them did not offer the MR-G. Ace, however, was an exception to this rule. At a rainy day in November 2016 I got to know Ace by accident as I was strolling through Amsterdam. Glancing through the window of their store at the Van Baerlestraat I noticed that they sold G-Shock. It got even better when I saw various MR-G models in their display. I was courteously assisted by Alon who, what I learned at a later point, is the owner of the Ace & Dik branch. He showed me the various models and passionately shared all his knowledge on the brand. The way he interacted with me on a personal level and informed me about the watch made me really feel comfortable. Even though I did not purchase the watch right away, this first impression certainly was a good one and definitely made Ace my preferred jeweler for buying this watch.\nFast forward to January 2017. I made up my mind and decided on buying the watch. To this extent I did some research and noticed in Ace's webshop that they were offering two similar (identical) models of the MR-G at a different price. To find out the differences between these models I contacted the customer service via e-mail. Jenna from the Ace Congierge replied within two days, which I consider to be fairly quick when considering the medium, and told me that these models were identical and the price on the difference in price in their webshop was a mistake. In order to compensate for the inconvenience Jenna offered me the watch for the lowest price, which I actually didn't expect and consider to be very generous. I happily accepted this offer and after exchanging a few messages and an arrangement was made to view and try the watch in their boutique at the Van Baerlestraat.\nUpon visiting their boutique I was assisted by Margo. At this point she did not realize that I already have had contact with the Congierge Service about the G-Shock MR-G. Unfortunately she told me the watch had just been sold to an overseas customer and therefore wasn't in stock anymore. G-Shock Netherlands was contacted, though they indicated that it was not known when they were able to deliver the watch when it was ordered, something I already knew from my contact with other jewelers. Margo, however, did not let me down and gave the extra mile by offering to contact G-Shock Germany to find out whether the watch could be ordered from Germany. I had barely exited the boutique or Margo called me back already with the news that the watch could be ordered in Germany and that it would take up to two weeks until it would arrive at their boutique.\nThe next day, I got another call from Margo happily informing me that the watch actually was in stock as it was reserved for me through the Congierge Service, apologizing for the fact that she didn't realize that I was the one who have had contact with the Congierge Service. During my visit Margo assisted me at a personal level and answered all the questions I had. Unfortunately I noticed that the case of the watch had a little scratch. This scratch could not be repaired by polishing so we decided on waiting for the new watch from Germany to arrive, which would take about two weeks. A week later I was notified that the watch already had arrived, which happily surprised me. Another plus for Ace! In the end it thus didn't take too much time to complete the purchase of the watch.\nSo all-in-all Ace surprised me positively. I therefore consider Ace to be the jeweler that really goes the extra mile for their clients. The staff has a great amount of knowledge and interacts with their customers in a very pleasant and personal manner, which is something I really appreciate. Their service, both on- and offline, is extraordinary, which is something to be very proud on and should really be cherished. I'm pretty sure this wasn't my last purchase at Ace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:31:53.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

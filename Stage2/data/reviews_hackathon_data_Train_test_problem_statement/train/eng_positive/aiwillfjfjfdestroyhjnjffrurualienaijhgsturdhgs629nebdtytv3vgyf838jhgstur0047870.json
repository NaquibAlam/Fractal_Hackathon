The peace of mind was definately worth the extra cost. Everything went like clockwork. We arrived at Seville airport where we only had to wait about 10 minutes to be attended to by a very helpful and polite young lady. When we returned the car we were met by a another helpful young lady in the carpark who checked the car over. Unfortunately some other driver had banged our passenger door with theirs leaving a nasty scratch, but as we had the 'super relax' cover we were ok. We received the deposit (which we had to leave for the petrol full/full) back within 24 hrs. I had spent quite a bit of time beforehand reading all of the rules and regulations on the web page as I didnt want any nasty surprises along the way, and it definately paid off. Our first experience with Goldcar was definately a positive one and we wont hesitate to use them in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:46:59.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A unique single post deck with 4 terminals and large wicking ports for big builds and easy wicking system. The terminals are 2.5 x 2mm and the screws are philips head capscrews. The top delrin cap has embedded stainless steel threading minimising the risk of stripping the topcap threads. Huge and I mean huge fill holes makes it extremely easy to fill. The threading is super smooth.\nSome Features:\n24mm Diameter\nStainless Steel & Pyrex Glass Construction\nThreaded Top Fill Design\n5ml Tank Capacity\nUnique Single Post Design with 4 terminals\nPEEK Insulator Made In Germany\n4 large Wicking Ports\nDual Adjustable Bottom Airflow\nGold Plated 510 Pin\nThe cloud production on the Troll RTA is superb, but the flavour, oh wow, just AMAZING.\nI experienced no spitback and no leakage. A must have for all you serious builders and flavour chasers.\nThe delivery from Heavengifts was superfast. The RTA arrived within 4 days from China to South Africa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T22:30:52.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They offered such a wide variety of experiences at amazing prices. Any queries were answered immediately and the follow up was brilliant and instantaneous. One of our tours did not proceed (due to NO fault whatsoever of backpackerdeals.com) but had been refunded in full, without question, even before we returned home. Can not recommend these people highly enough and will most certainly be using their services again in the future. Give them a try, you will NOT be disappointed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T17:39:55.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

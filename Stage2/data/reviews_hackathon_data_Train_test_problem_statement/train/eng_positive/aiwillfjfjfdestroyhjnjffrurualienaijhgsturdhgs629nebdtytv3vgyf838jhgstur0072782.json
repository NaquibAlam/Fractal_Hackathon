We appreciated the variety of mattresses to choose from and their descriptions. We also purchased the covers for the mattresses based off the color description and pictures. My only suggestion would be to put more pictures on the site, especially full pictures of the covers already on a mattress and on a frame so that people can get a better perspective of how it would look once set up. Looking at a little small swatch picture of the futon cover makes it hard to tell what the cover will look like as a whole once it is actually on the mattress.\nThe website was easy to use and order from and they contacted me right away about how delivery works. The company who delivered the mattresses was an 1.5 hours late but very courteous and efficient.\nThe mattresses themselves are awesome! Highly recommended!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T13:09:41.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

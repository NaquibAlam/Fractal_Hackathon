The meals are almost always made in a timely manner within 30-40 minutes total and I've only had a few that I really didn't like at all. My only issue is that the meals can sometimes become repetitive and for the price I am paying I think they need to come up with something else. Also, try to use more family friendly favorites instead of weird meals that seem like they would be found on a menu in an expensive restaurant downtown. Otherwise, great customer service and good food that is healthy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:42:14.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I do have a couple of reservations, specifically of the quality of particular foods.\nWe are not real pleased with the chicken. Typically I buy free range so perhaps we are spoiled with better tasting chicken. The beef has been fine and ditto with the pork chops except this week one chop had an excessive amount of fat. No big deal, I cut it off, however the amount of meat was compromised. These are not deal makers for me. I will continue to subscribe to HF. I love the ability to pause delivery when necessary or jsut to take a break.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T15:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:50:41.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

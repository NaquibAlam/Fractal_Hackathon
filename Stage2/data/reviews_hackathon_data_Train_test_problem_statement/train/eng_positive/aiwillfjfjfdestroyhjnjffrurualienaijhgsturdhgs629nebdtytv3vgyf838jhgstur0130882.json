I got it today from ordering on Tuesday/Wednesday and it's perfect! The sizechart was a bit off though, I am 167 and weighs 70 kg and the sizechart with my measurements told me to get size 16 (because of my damn butt) but the dress I bought was \"flowy\" and not fitted so I followed my gut and ordered size 8. I am normally size 40 in European and size 8 in European is 38, so it fitted perfectly!!! Now I have a dress that nobody else on my prom in Sweden has, love!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:28:08.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

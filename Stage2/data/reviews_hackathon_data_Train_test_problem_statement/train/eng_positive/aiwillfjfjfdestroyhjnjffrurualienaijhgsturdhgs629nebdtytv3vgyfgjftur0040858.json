I came up with the idea of ordering a hoodie with my college's logo and hoping they noticed. The hoodie came the day after the estimated arrival date, which was fine because there wasn't an exact date. When it came, I ran outside when the mailman wasn't looking. I ran to my room and put it on. Perfect fit! The logo was even bigger than I imagined which was good because on the order screen, it looked pretty small. The inside was also very soft! I will definitely be depending on Prepsportswear for my future needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:35:17.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

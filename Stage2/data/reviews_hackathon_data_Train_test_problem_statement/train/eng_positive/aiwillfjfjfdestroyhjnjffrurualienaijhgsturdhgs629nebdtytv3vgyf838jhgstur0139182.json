We receive water from a well, and we had problems with our washing machine screen constantly plugging up with fine material, hard water problems, and using more soap for dishes, clothes, and showers. We noticed immediately that less soap was required, and although the water does not feel as \"soft\" as a salt based softener, it does the job. We also purchased the installation kit which made it very easy to install the system. I would highly recommend purchasing the installation kit, although I believe it should be included with the purchase of each system. The installation instructions are very clear and simple to follow. An item not mentioned in the instructions and should be added: if you have an ice maker in your refrigerator, empty the ice tray after the first day the water conditioner/softener is in use. We used @6 gallons of purified drinking water for drinking and for our coffee maker every week (we've gone through several coffee machines in the past ten year because of our hard well water). Water through the conditioner/softener tastes better, and time will tell if our coffee machine will last a lot longer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:10:32.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

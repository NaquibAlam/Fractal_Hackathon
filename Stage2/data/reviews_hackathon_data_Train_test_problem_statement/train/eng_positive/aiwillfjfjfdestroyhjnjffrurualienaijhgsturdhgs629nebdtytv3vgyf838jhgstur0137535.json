Our representative was thorough in her training and adjusted the training timeline to suit our needs. She constantly followed up to see what questions had come up since the previous training and was quick in responding to any questions or resolving issues. The system is very user-friendly, though it does require time spent actively familiarizing as there are many little details to pay attention to. So far very impressed and pleased we partnered with DynaFile and quite excited to have such a robust system in place for our electronic storage needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:19:35.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Needless to say, I was not mentally able to try to track down the best flight rates and schedule that fit my immediate needs. And I NEVER used a travel company that didn't allow me to book online--ever. However, booking was very easy with Roosevelt at SkyLux Travel, mostly done by phone and email, but very quick. He was very sensitive to the situation under which I was traveling, and was truly very helpful and even offered support. I'd like to think that if I had a son that he would be much like Roosevelt. SkyLux is very fortunate to have such an employee. Hopefully the actual travel experience will be as flawless, I plan to use SkyLux on my return flight, and future flights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T19:53:54.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

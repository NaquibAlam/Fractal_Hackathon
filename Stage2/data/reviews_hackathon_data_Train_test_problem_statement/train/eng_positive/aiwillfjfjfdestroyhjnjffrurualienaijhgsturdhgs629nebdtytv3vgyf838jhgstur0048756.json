I had only just finished moving all the contents out and called Nick Whyte to come and do an appraisal. He and his assistant Jessika Spink, were so professional and I felt comfortable in leaving all details up to them. They suggested slight renovations and got a stylist in to maximise the saleability, and boy did it work out beautifully. The price we got at auction was above and beyond our expectations. I am very pleased to recommend this company to anyone selling their home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T05:21:44.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

If you buy candy often, especially gourmet candies, you will see Candy Club's prices are extremely fair. I've always received fresh candy with a fast arrival. Their cotton candy taffy is my favorite, and I love getting it scattered all around the containers inside. I've always received my box on a day when I most needed it..it always brings a smile to my face and it's perfect for sharing. Their customer service is 11 out of 10, and that's the one thing that I think could possibly be sweeter than than the candy. Love it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:13:55.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

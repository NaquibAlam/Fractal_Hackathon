There is no way I could have paid off almost $40,000 in less than 4 years on my own.\nI highly recommend them. Their customer service is great, they were very kind and worked with me on the few occasions I needed to make adjustments. If you are willing to sacrifice some things which you might not see as \"luxuries\" and put your mind to it, TCA can be very instrumental in helping you with reducing or eliminating your credit card debt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:21:31.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

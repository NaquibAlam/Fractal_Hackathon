We guessed he or a she swerved away but wow the bang as he/she carried off our passenger wing mirror to be further crushed in the road behind us - NOTE: being a french hired car that was the left side mirror which you see when sat IN the car.\nnaturally we took out Full Protection with Rentalcars and we were pleased to as Europecars decided to charge us over 300 euros for this sad experience!\nImmediately at the accident we phone Europe-cars in Paris and were told to tell the Police the offending car's registration number.\nAs that idiot had hit us we think at 70mph (was he being chased? - I think escaping someone, really!) no way could we read his number plate, so the police said I could have made it up and so on as no reg number.\nLUCKILY (and I bet this happens to loads of people each year in hired cars in France) Rentalcars refunded us immediately!

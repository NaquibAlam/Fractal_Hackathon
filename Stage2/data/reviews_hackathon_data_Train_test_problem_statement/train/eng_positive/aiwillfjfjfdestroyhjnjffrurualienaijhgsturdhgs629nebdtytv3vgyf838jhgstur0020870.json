I needed to understand the type of panels available, work out the viability of adding more panels to my existing ones, difference between Gross, Net, Digital and Smart Meters and working out long term costs and return on any solar investments I might make.. Added to this I also needed information on solar batteries and whether they are worth buying now and what are the benefits. I googled high and low for a couple of weeks and downloaded heaps of information, mostly repetitive and not very helpful until I hit the Solar Quote: s site. Here was extensive, no nonsense, easy to follow information and other informative details. This helped me understand the differences between string and microinverter panels, phase 1 and 3 Inverters, the types of meters as well as working out a real life return on investment on the very detailed solar calculator on the Solar Quote: s website. On top of that it was dead quick and easy to get 3 Quote: s from retailers who had been recommended by Finn Peacock, founder of Solar Quote: s. I also received follow up emails from Finn and his team and discussed with him on the phone my personal situation to which he gave me some sound advise. I do not have any affiliation with Solar Quote: s or any other Solar company but I can assure anyone looking for information on Solar systems,and get acquainted with the different systems, where to get an honest retailer,do yourself a favour and latch on to this little gem of a site and/or email the Solar Quote: s team. There is no cost as Solar Quote: s are mainly there to give advice and assist people make an informative decision. You will not need any other website or rely on a Solar representative whose only focus might be to get a commission.

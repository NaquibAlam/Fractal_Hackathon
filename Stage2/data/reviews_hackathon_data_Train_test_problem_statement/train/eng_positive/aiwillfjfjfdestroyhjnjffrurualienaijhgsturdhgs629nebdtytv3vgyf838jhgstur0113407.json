Please accept the following comments as positive and in no way critical of the work and intended as helpful to your artist; Rouseau was a primitive self taught artist and as a result his work is marked by some bizzare traits, for example whilst the modification to the sky Gan made are logical his original sky colouring with addition of small bright points of light would be more true to the original despite reality that in a sky that bright stars would not be visible! Similarly despite the fact that in general the painting appears to be in a rural settingthe backlighting of\nthe trees is from a street lamp that would be most unlikely in that location. Of course, being a copy it somewhat lacks the energy of the original which is rendered in much more thickly applied paint;\nAll that being said we are really pleased with our painting and hope to be able to make further purchases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:39:53.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Everything was nice, clean and well kept. Enough space for 3 families/generations with small kids. Very nice playing areas for everyone. Fantastic view!! - an a nice and warm gated pool . The kids wanted to come back withiin the first 5 minuttes! And if I go back to Lanzarote I would try to rent the same house - or a house through Optima Villas. Very good service. I can also recommend Plus car - using af very simple concept. Thanks for giving us optimal condittions for our stay.\nKind regards\nGitte petersen", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T19:40:02.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This is the second trip we have planned through them and both have been exceptional. We planned our own itinerary, sent it to Goway and had a proposed itinerary from Tracey Riddell within 24 hours. We flew from Thunder Bay to Toronto to Sydney through Vancouver without a hitch. She even booked a lunch for us on the Vancouver-Toronto flight each way which was a pleasant surprise. Our shuttle services were good. Hotels were in excellent locations in Sydney, Melbourne, Port Fairy and Adelaide. We were able to walk throughout the city and access public transportation easily. The hotel staff in all places were very friendly and helpful. We stayed one night in Naracoorte and found the accommodation quite dated and tired. Otherwise, we enjoyed the entire trip and are looking forward to returning and expanding our area of travel. Of course, we would not hesitate to have Goway take care of us once again. We have already started recommending Goway to our friends for their travel planning. Many thanks to Tracey for helping us have a stress free, amazing time Downunder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:19:25.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

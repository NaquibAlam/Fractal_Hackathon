The last was Aloha Bob, which I used to migrate the machine I just used this product on, 7 years ago. That program and company is gone, so the first thing I did when getting ready to retire the Windows 7 machine was look around for what was available now. This product was over twice as much as their nearest competitor, so I originally went with that product, but it failed pretty badly. So, I paid for this one, and found that there was something wrong with my machine's WMI sub-system. I got in touch with Zlink's customer support, and they quickly resolved the problem . Migration from Windows 7 to Windows 10 was almost flawless, and the few glitches from transferring from a 7 year old machine were minor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T13:18:55.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

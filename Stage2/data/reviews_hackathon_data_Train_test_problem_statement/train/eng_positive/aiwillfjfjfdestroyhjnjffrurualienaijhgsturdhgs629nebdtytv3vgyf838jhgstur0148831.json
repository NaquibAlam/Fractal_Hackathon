Though the ring was beautiful, it didn't match well with her engagement ring and wedding band (difficult to do when it's a surprise). I contacted customer service and no questions asked they were willing to modify or replace with a different style to better match her existing rings. Communication was great, no pressure experience and even was provided a 1 week extension on the return policy just based on the timing of having a new ring made and shipped to then decide if we were keeping the first and making modifications to the setting or keeping the second. Would definitely recommend. As a side note, we walked into a local jewelry store just to take a look at various settings and after looking over my wife's ring from PrimeStyle, they pulled out comparable options that were 6 times what I paid. Any uncertainty I had about cost and quality was gone. This won't be my last purchase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:13:19.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

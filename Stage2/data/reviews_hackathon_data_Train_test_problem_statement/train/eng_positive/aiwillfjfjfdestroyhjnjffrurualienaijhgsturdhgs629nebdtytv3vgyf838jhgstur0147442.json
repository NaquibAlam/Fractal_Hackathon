They were upfront and honest about what we could afford. We didn't test drive a vehicle until we were approved. We were allowed to walk the lot without a salesman, note any vehicles we were interested in and questions and even take our time test driving by ourselves without a salesman. We had a car within a matter of hours and experienced a no pressure sale! Thanks Oak Motors for making our car buying experience a pleasure and something enjoyable!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:28:30.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

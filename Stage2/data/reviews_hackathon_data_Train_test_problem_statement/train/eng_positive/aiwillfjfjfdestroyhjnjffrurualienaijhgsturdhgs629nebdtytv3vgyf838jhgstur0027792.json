I would definitely recommend them. The cabin we rented was nice but could have been better. It has very large windows that needed a good cleaning and there were two outside garbage cans strapped to the front porch next to the swing. We were on our honeymoon so the ambience could have been a little better. The location was very nice and quiet but there are other cabins close by. Overall we were happy.

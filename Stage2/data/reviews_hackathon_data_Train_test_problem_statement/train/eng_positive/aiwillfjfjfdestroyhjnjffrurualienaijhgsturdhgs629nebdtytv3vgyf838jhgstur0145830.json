The JW will not disappoint. The breakfast buffet in Mansita is bountiful and will satisfy all taste buds. We dinned at the steak house and the chef accommodated our special request. The waiter Miguel was also superb! We also dined at Tamarine, our meal was delicious and the waiter Giovanni was a pleasure.\nWe relaxed by the pool in the mornings and enjoyed ourselves on the beach in the afternoon. The staff at Azul; Santos, Carlos and Luis welcomed us each day with a smile and excellent service. The concierge: Heiner, was pleasant and very helpful, a true asset to the hotel!\nWe also went to the beach club for dinner on Friday evening (free shuttle), the food was exceptional as well as the atmosphere.\nThe hotel provided live music on Saturday evening in the courtyard-incredible acoustic's.\nOur only con is the transportation fees which are exorbitant and unwarranted! i.e.: $80.00 round trip to go 3.8 kilometers (Lola's) and $40.00/round trip to go into Tamarino.\nAll in all we enjoyed our beach stay and will return.\nThe second half of our trip we went to Nayara Springs. Nayara Springs is the perfect combination of relaxed sexy-elegance and luxury. The entire resort is perfectly orchestrated with attention to every detail. The grounds are designed in harmony with the natural beauty of Costa Rica. We spotted so much native wildlife during our stay. From the moment we arrived until we departed, we were met with sincere hospitality seldom seen at a resort.\nThe reception area was beautifully decorated, and the staff friendly and welcoming. The evening of our arrival we were invited to a welcome cocktail and was greeted with a wide, genuine smile by Frederic Cappello, Resort Manager. He is kind and friendly, and present throughout our stay. From there on in EVERYTHING was purely magical!\nOur villa was stunningly appointed-luxury at itâ€™s best. The bathroom is spacious with a his & her area including an outdoor and indoor shower. The private plunge pool, is heated by natural hot springs and situated off a large teak deck boosting a day bed, hammock and table. It is surrounded by lush flora, a unique combination of natural beauty and pure heaven! Nayara offers a range of free amenities from organic bug spray, free high speed internet, plate of fruits, snacks and soft drinks, laundry service, daily yoga, bird watching to internal calls.\nWe dined at most of the restaurants, the gourmet food and exotic drinks we experienced were delicious and unique while the service was unsurpassable. Two of the restaurants offered live local music. The wine bar, Nostalgia offers a large variety of wine in a relaxed vibe. We enjoyed each afternoon with happy hour at Cielto Lindo and was mesmerized by the beauty of Arenal Volcano. It is difficult to single out an individual as all of the staff were friendly, courteous and happy to be there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:52:42.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

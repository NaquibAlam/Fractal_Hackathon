Worked out everyday until the last year or so when I got a puppy and did not have time for workouts. Even with out the work outs I lost weight. Nutrisystem works for me because it's a no-brainer when it comes to decisions on what to eat daily. They provide so many tools and guides, even a grocery guide. A bonus outcome is that I have cultivated better eating habits over the last month and enjoy the 4 servings of veggies and really make an effort to drink lots of water. I've also learned more about proper nutrition and know what to look for in recipes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:43:32.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

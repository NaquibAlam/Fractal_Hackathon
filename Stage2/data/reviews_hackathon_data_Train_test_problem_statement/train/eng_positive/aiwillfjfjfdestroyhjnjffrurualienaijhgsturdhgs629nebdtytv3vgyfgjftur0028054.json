I called with questions and they were answered knowledgeably with the idea planted that I could call back if I had more questions. When they designed my folder, I made changes twice - and they did it without question. The folders were shipped and received quickly and I love the way they look. I would say that I could have got them cheaper elsewhere, but the samples and their willingness to talk me through the process was worth the extra cost. Compared to other companies I shopped, this one actually seemed to WANT my business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T22:04:43.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

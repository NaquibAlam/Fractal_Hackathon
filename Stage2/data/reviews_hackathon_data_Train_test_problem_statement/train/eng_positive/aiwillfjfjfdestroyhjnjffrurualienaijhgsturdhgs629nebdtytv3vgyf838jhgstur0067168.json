I went to Town Fair Tire to see if it could be fixed, only to be told they didn't sell me that particular tire. I bought 2 tires in March of 2016 and then 2 more tires in October of 2016. After looking at the paperwork and speaking with a supervisor, the manager told me what he think happened. When I bought the tires in March, the new tires were put on the back of my car. When I bought the tires in October, the new tires were put on the back. He said what he thinks happened is that the tires that were on the back (the ones I bought in March) were never put on the front of my car. He gave me 2 new tires at no charge. I was very happy with the outcome, however, when I buy tires again, I will check them to make sure I have the correct ones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:16:51.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

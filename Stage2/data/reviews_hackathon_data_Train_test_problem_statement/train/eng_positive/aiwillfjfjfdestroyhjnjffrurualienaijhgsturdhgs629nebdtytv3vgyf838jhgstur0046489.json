The whole process was seamless and the tickets arrived in plenty of time to print out and take to the concert which we loved. More than happy with the experience and would recommend to our friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T09:04:40.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

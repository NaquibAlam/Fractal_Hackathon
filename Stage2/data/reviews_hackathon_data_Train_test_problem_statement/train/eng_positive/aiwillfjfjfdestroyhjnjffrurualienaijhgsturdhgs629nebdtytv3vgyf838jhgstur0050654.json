The only 2 minor glitches were that it arrived in separate deliveries over 2 days (which was fine), however:\n- the 1st delivery note did not state the remaining items would be delivered via a separate order, which I found confusing as I thought the remaining items were missing. This necessitated a phone call to Ink Station who were friendly\n- the 'comments' on my online order for 'safe drop' of the items ordered at my home if no one was home did not appear on the parcels delivered or the courier company's notes, which meant 2 trips to the local post office to collect the deliveries.\nEverything else was great!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T11:54:27.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

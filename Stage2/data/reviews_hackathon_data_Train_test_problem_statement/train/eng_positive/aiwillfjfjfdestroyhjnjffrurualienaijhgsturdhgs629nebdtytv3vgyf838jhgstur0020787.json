We are a small nature center in Boca Raton, FL, and we needed these stamps to help round out a scavenger hunt-style program we are holding as part of Sea Turtle Awareness Month. The stamps came out beautifully, and we are looking forward to our upcoming program.\nThank you Carol and everyone at Rubber Stamp Champ for your excellent customer service, quick turn-around and wonderful products.\nSave the Sea Turtles!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T05:35:47.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

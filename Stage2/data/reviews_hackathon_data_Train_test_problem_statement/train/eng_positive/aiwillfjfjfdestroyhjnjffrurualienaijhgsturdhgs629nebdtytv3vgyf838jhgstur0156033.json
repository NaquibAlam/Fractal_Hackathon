Sheenco (then Shamrock) were very accommodating as I ran a bake off between various tour providers. they won on price and then they followed by winning on service. we were able to stay 2 days at Dromoland Castle, where our driver Dave, who doubled as our tour guide and local lore master, then picked us up for a 6 day tour through Knock, Galway, back thru the Burren to the Cillfs of Moher, around thru Adare for 2 nights in Killarney and the Ring of Kerry. then it was off to Kilkenny (with a stop at Loftus Hall on the Hook) and finally back for 3 nights in Dublin. all hotels were wonderful and in the center of town where we could walk to pubs and restaurants. they were also very responsive to our needs on both ends of our trip when we did not have a driver. I would absolutely use them again for Ireland and the UK.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:50:21.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

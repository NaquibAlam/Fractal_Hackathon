I'm sure I asked a lot of silly questions, but she never made me feel that they were at all.\nJason also was very helpful with the final signing of paperwork. I emailed him late one night not expecting an answer until the next day, but had one within minutes.\nMichael called once settlement was ready to take place to ensure I was happy with everything and understood it all and to see if I had any questions.\nHighly recommend NOW Finance and these wonderful people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T18:13:27.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

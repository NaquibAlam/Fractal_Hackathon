Our hotels were comfortable and we saw lots of fascinating sites.\nWe especially loved L'MA Lodge in Skoura....what a special place. The Berbere Palace and a few of the stops were more \"tourist places\", though perfectly good....not sure what the choices are so I can't really double guess where else we might have gone....our only hitch was the camel ride at the Maharaba Luxury Tents....Having ridden camels through the Erg Chebbie dunes for 6 days a few years ago, I can say the ride offered at the Tent Camp were not great....very bad saddles...not enough padding, and no instruction,....and up and down such steep dunes that it was very unpleasant. Plus one of the saddles kept sliding sideways. We were thankful for the electric blankets at the camp...that was heaven....and the food was very good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T07:49:18.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

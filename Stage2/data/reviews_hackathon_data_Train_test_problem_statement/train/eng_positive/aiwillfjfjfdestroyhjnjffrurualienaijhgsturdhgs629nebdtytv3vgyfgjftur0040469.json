Prior with an 800 plus credit score I could walk on any lot, pick any car, get the best interest rates (usually 0%) and drive off the lot. I can't do that now and originally looked at a couple buy here pay here lots. I am shocked at how bad those bottom feeders treated people. I was to the point I was going to tuck my tail between my legs and ask my elderly parents to cosign. I took a second to look at the DriveTime web site. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity of vehicles to choose from. So I took a gamble and completed an application. Immediately I was qualified for any vehicle I wanted on the lot with a down payment I could afford. I went to my local DriveTime and took the car out I liked for a test drive and loved the car. It was obvious that they scrutinize the vehicles they sale for quality. After putting a bit more down than the minimum I drove off the lot with twice the car from the other lot and lower payments and interest rates 10% less interest rates to be exact! Now to the employees. I was treated better at DriveTime than any other dealership I have ever bought a car from....ever. I will wholeheartedly recommend buying a car from this company. You have a forever grateful customer who feels like a king after walking out of your dealership. 5 stars for sure! Thank you DriveTime in Independence, Missouri!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:04:02.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Recently we found a crack on one of the support rails. I called the manufacture and they said I had to go thru American Freight to get the warrantee work done and it was covered and would replace it. I contacted the manager Randy L. and he was most helpful and replaced it on the spot which he did not have to do. I will continue to do business in the future because of the way I was treated. Bob B.

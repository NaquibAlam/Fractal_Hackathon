I knew I wanted Whole of Life cover rather than term and quite a few companies (both brokers and insurers themselves) tried to steer me away from WoL, but not Life Search, they actually saved me money and I've walked away with three policies for the price of one! (just by suggesting to reduce my WoL cover amount a little)\nI was very nervous about the telephone interview and giving over bank details that way but the person I spoke to was very reassuring and after the insurance documents came through it was a big sigh of relief.\nA big thankyou to Charlotte who advised and spoke to me about different policies and reassured me.\nIn short, amazing customer service and genuinely helpful and friendly people!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T09:09:57.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

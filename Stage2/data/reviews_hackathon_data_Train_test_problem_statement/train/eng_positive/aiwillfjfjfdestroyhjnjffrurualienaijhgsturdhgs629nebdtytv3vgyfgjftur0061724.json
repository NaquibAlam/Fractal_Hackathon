He had a very clean vehicle that accommodated 6 adults. His microphone REALLY helped. He was prepared, informative, helpful, humorous and an overall delight! This was a terrific tour with a well prepared guide. **Don't hesitate to book a tour with Josh!** We went to a great little spot for lunch, visited 'out of the way' places and even hiked into the woods to look into a volcanic steam vent and walk into and through a lava tube. It was an excellent experience for all of us! What a pleasure to be picked up at the cruise ship terminal and whisked away for a wonderful day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:16:45.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

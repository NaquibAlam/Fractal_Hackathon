I've sometimes picked up the phone and pushed a call button accidentally, maybe you could make it so you push the call button twice? Also, if you missed a call, you don't know who has tried to call you (I don't have a suggestion for this one). Apart from these small points I have found the phone to be excellent.\nThanks KISA - I knew you were good. Since I wrote my review yesterday you have modified my phone to a two button caller.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T23:15:47.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

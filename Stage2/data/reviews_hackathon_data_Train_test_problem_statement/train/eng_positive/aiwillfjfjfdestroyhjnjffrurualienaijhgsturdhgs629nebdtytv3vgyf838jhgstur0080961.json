Every single pick up, driver, guide and representative was outstanding. All on time, very polite with very clean and efficient vehicles.\nHotels picked for us were first class and we had a fantastic time.\nThe beach resort hotel room was not suitable as it was substandard but the Indian agent very quickly acted to correct it by moving us to a suitable room without cost.\nDialAFlight once again were excellent on organising a superb holiday experience. Nothing is ever too much for them even though we were very challenging along the planning stage.\nAmazingly DialAFlight can still keep their 'phones answered within 5 seconds' promise which is spectacular.\nLiam and his team, our personal contact, remains very efficient, friendly and keen to help.\nWe continue to use them as holiday planning is a pleasure with their help rather than a stressful experience.\nThanks Liam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T10:37:56.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

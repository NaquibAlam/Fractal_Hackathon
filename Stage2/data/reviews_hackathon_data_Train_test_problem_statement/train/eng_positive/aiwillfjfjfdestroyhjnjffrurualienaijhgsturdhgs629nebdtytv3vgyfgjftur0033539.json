I had flustered to make a mistake when a pop up window appeared with great price while searching for flights to Venice from Berlin. Unfortunately the pop up window with that tempting price took to flight with opposite directions, that is from Venice to Berlin :) This I didn´t notice and quickly went on to book the good price.\nUpon receiving my itinerary I realised what I´d done. I called the customer service ( via skype, which is the most economical way for international calls) but it was closed during the night. The day after I proceeded to phone the customer service and was answered by a noticeably courteous and clear spoken gentleman named SUFIYAN. He was extremely helpful and I immediately felt safe, because our communication was clear and his manners were assuring. SUFIYAN fixed my flight and even went out of his way to make the correction as cheap for me as possible. I wish all agents were this capable cause it is important in situations that can seem stressful. He managed to turn my agony into the relief of a problem solved in a fair way. Leaving me as customer, very satisfied and happy with the result. A top quality agent who handled the task surely with his patience and care secured that I will not hesitate to purchase flight tickets via the eDreams company again. Thank you Sufyian and eDreams company, it is a pleasure to do business with you :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:47:56.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

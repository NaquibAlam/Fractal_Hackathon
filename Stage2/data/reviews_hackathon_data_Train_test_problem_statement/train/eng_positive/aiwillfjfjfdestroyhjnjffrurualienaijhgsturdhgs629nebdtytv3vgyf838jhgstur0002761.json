It felt like a nice change going from a snooty environment to a friendly and respectful environment this company has created. The people are nice and friendly and really put all their effort into finding what the customer wants and not once tried to sell me something that I didn't want. Overall I highly recommend that if you are looking for a storage with reasonable prices and full of great employees, \"public storage\" is the place to go!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:28:17.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

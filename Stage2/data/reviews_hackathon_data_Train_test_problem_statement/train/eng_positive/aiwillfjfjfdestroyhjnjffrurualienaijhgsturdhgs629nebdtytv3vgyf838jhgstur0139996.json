It helps prevent damage during shipping. It's packaged a lot better than their competitors. I have only had one box out of the many that I've gotten have any issues. That's the reason for the four stars. Hello Fresh offers innovative and healthy meals to it's customers. They're fun to make and don't take a long period of time to complete.

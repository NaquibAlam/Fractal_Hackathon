The hotel in Sydney, Metro Hotel on Pitt, was less than desirable. The breakfast was awful. The tours booked for us in Sydney were perfect, they allowed us to see most of the city in only a few days.\nThe other hotels were fantastic in the Blue Mountains, Port Stephens and Hunter Valley. We loved being able to drive around the area and see more than Sydney itself during our time there.\nUnfortunately we really wanted to adjust our trip a few weeks prior to our departure but since we had already paid for the trip Vered was very unwilling to assist with our changes. I was supremely unimpressed by Vered and his customer service prior to our arrival in Sydney. He could have left a much better impression by extending his help, instead he made what we thought was a minor change an impossible one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:17:11.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

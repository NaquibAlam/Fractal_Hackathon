I decided to try its service. Theodore came a few minutes before the appointment. That does not happen with other services often! You get the 2- or 4-hour window, and serviceman shows usually up at the end of the window, or later. Theodore was better than perfect on this item. He started work immediately, and was done quickly. He explained to me the work done and his recommendations for the future. He showed me worn out parts, which was very appreciated. He asked me to test-drive the car. He noticed the worn wipers and he replaced them (I had a spare pair) for me and refused to charge me for that. He was very polite and patient. That was a great experience, and extremely convenient for me. And pricing was considerably lower than the dealer Quote: . The invoice came to a little less than original Quote: . So it is obvious that I will use this service, and Theodore's in particular, again, and encourage my family and friends to use it Thank you Theodore! The system behind the whole operation of YourMechanic.com is also impressive, from the first moment of investigating the site, to the invoice generation. It is very smooth, very modern, efficient, and thorough, with no confusion whatsoever. Quite unusual. It even notified me this morning when Theodore left for the appointment and allowed me to monitor his progress, so I was ready for him when he arrived.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:24:15.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

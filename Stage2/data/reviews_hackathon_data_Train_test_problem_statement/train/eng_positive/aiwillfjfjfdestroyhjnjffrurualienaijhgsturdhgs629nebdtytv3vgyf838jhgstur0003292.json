The price was fair. This is a piece I have been looking for, for a while, and finally decided to do it. My only issue is that the picture should have been packed so it didn't move around so much. On the two top corners, the color has been rubbed off and white is showing through. This is because of the picture shifting in the box as it was transported. A little bubble wrap on the sides, top and bottom of the box would have helped. From a distance, no one can tell, but I may get out a marker and touch up the two spots that bother me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:01:37.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

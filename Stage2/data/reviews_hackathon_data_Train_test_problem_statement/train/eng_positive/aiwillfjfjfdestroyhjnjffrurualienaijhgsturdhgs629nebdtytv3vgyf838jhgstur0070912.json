We didn't want to put him in a kennel, so I went online and found DogVacay. It's like the AirBandB for dogs. People make a profile and offer their services to watch your dog at their house or apartment, they name their price per night. We have used it three times now with three different dog sitters. We used three different dog sitters not because any of them were bad, but because the first ones moved and the second ones were not available the third time.\nCheck out the site, I would recommend it 100%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T08:48:07.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

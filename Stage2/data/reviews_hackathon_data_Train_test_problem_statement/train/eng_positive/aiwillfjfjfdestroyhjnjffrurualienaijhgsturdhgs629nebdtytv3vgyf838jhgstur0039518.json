I have bought previously from the US (just beacons) and the price I paid was over what Freeze Pro listed. Postage from the Scotland was great value (only $9.50 AUD) and quick! I ordered on Monday and received the package on Thursday morning. I could track the package all the way from Edinburgh to Melbourne. I hope I never have to use the avalanche kits, but having this equipment gives me some security when we now go trekking in the back country.\nI will definitely recommend Freeze Pro to my family and friends!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:39:36.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

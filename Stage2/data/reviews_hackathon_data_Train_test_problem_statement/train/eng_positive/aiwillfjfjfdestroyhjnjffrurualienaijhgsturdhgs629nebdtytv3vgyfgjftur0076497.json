It was nothing short of the trip of a\nLifetime. Being a woman in my mid fifties and on my own I was nervous but there was absolutely no need. From the moment our beautiful tour guides, Phillippe and David, met us at the station I knew thing would work out well.\nBeing a foodie I had high expectations and they were met and surpassed. Our meals each night in our beautiful hotel were spectacular and went late into the evening with our guides quickly becoming friends. We ate in country restaurants with amazing home cooked food and cheeses to die for. Under plane trees at a cooking school that was the stuff of long held dreams. In a Michelin star restaurant overlooking the Mediterranean in the beautiful town of Cassis. We ate in the countryside and dined on produce gathered by our guides and it was a meal I'll never forget. Duck sausage, others studded with olives, again the most beautiful cheeses and breads and strawberries and melons sweeter than I've ever tasted. With each and every meal the most beautiful wines were served. All truly joyful.\nWe visited towns and villages that wetted my appetite to visit again but none more beautiful than St Remy. A particular highlight for me was visiting the hospital where Van Gough spent time. This was an added extra because the women wanted to see it and seemed to be so effortlessly arranged. The cloister in the chapel has to be seen and felt. We visited markets and walled villages, where the views were sublime. Each day surpassing the one before it.\nI cannot speak highly enough of the care shown to every guest. Phillippe and David went way beyond what would be expected. Please do yourself a favour and take this or one of their other tours. I promise it will be The Stuff if Dreams!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T13:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:53:23.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

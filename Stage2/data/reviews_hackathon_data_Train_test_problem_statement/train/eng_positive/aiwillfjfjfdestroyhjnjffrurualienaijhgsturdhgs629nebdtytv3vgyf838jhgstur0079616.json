I was so pleased when I found this product - Customer Service was helpful in answering my questions and helping me decide on the right light. I gave this 4 stars because of the poor adhesion of the backing- the paper that covered the self stick area peeled off before we were ready to apply it. It would not adhere. We ultimately purchased a roll of thin double side tape , and after some manipulation it well positioned now. I love the appearance and the quality of this item.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T10:05:27.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There's not a lot of steps like other sites. Booking my flight was a pleasure using your site. It's quick and to the point of what I wanted without all the hassle of too many steps to finish your booking. I also liked that when I was timed out that when I went back in to search the same flight my information was still there, unlike other sites I would have had to renter all my information again. Great experience and I'll definitely recommend you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T09:37:29.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

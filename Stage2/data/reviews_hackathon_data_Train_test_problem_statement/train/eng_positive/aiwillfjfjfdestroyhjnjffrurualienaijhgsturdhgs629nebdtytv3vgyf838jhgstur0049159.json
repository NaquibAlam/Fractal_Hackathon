I hate the thought of digging through the lost and found. Before mabels labels I was using masking tape for school supplies which would always peel off or the marker would wear off. I absolutely love Mabels Labels they are reliable, sturdy and make labeling easy and fun for Moms and Kids. I would recommend these labels to anyone. Go out and get some.

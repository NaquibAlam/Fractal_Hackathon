The only problem I had was that he said that he would call me after Emailing him a picture of an Order for Half-Off the IID, well he never did. And when I spoke with him about when to set my appointment he set it the day after I asked to have it set for. Luckily I called the business to see how long the install would take and to confirm my appointment, and they said it was set for the next day at a time when I was going to be in class. The business luckily has time to let me bring in my vehicle, but now they or I have to call Intoxilock to get the paperwork changed to say the appointment is for today and not tomorrow. (For some reason that matters)\nIf the gentleman I spoke with on the phone would've called back like he said he was going to do, this probably would've been corrected then. (It was about 5-6pm central, so near business closing hours which may have been the reason he didn't call back) Overall I'm happy with the price and the fact that there is no humming needed with this product, but very happy I called the business who's installing this device and figured out this mistake before I drove there for nothing, I would've wrote a much more unhappy review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T22:11:58.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

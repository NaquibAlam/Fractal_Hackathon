Thank goodness we did!! We got a fantastic cabin with a big saving just where we wanted on the ship. We are travelling with our regular \"cruiselings\" but they booked through a travel agent and didn''t get such a great deal as we did. We would definitely recommend cruisesalefinder to anyone booking a cruise. Maybe we might go on another one later in the year!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T05:52:35.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

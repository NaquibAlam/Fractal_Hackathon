The quality of meat is fabulous, and the combination of flavors compliment each other beautifully. I appreciate having a large recipe card with large print making it easy to read and follow. The pictures on the card with meals plated has inspired me to serve dinner on REAL plates. I actually look forward to cooking because I feel like an accomplished cook! My husband says he feels like he's being treated to gourmet meals! We really like all the fresh vegetables with the idea of roasting them. All the recipes are fun and delicious!!\nThe only negative is instead of the meals arriving early Tuesday, they arrive Wednesday afternoon. This only allows me to cook Wed, Thursday, and Friday. (We have the family over on weekends) I'd like to receive the box earlier in the week such as Monday afternoon or at least by Tuesday afternoon. One of the meals from last week had potatoes that were rotten so I had to run to the grocery store to replace them. This is the only reason for not having a 5 star rating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:36:37.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

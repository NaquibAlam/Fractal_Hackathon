This, along with placement of the amplifier in the middle of our home finally granted us the desired 5 green lights that indicates the best signal for our area. The antenna boosted our cell phones and jet pack for Internet signals. We are no longer dropping cell phone calls and the Internet is much faster. We live in a very rural area and will never have the speed big cities offer, but are satisfied with download speeds of 3,4,5 and some 6 Mbps. This is great when you have been living with .43 to .79! No kidding. Unit was a little pricey but hopefully will give good service for several years. My advice is to set the unit pieces up and move them around in your home and outside for a week or so until you find the right combination to get the best signal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:21:10.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

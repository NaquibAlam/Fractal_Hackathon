Catherine Buchanan was my salesperson who came to my house to take measurements along with offering suggestions on the lay out and color of the flooring. Cathy was very knowledgeable about the material and the job requirements\nJoseph Santini was the installer who installed the tile and grout and also provided knowledge about the flooring and color selection. Joe was very precise in his cutting of the tile with a very close fit throughout the project. Joe was meticulous in keeping the work project clean along with the rest of my house. Joe also took the time to explain why he was doing certain things in the placing of the tile and the installation. Joe made me very comfortable with everything that he did and I was very pleased and satisfied with the finished project. I would recommend the team of Cathy Buchanan/Joseph Santini as the best sales/installation team to deal with on any tile flooring project that they were contemplating having done in their home or business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T03:05:35.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

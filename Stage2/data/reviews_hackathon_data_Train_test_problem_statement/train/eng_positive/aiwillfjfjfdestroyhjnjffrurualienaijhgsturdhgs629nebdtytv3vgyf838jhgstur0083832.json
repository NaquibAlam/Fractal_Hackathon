It incredibly sleek which makes it beautiful to look at and the materials that were used to make it are of top quality making it very durable. I feel very safe having my bitcoins in this wallet knowing that no one can nor will be able to steal my coins. The integration of altcoins and shapeshift make it perfect for future use in any other cryptocurrency. Do not be alarmed that KeepKey is a relatively new company, they are one of the best in the business.

The down side is they are generic; so in the big league copyright might blow it. (Unless I automatically own the copyright to my logo and website).\nI thought the merchandise ideas were also very good. One - Stop - Shop idea. Very good idea.\nQuality.\nWell, I thought the sweat shirt was too small, I.e. Short fitting. I guess I must be extra large. (I ordered large).\nBase ball cap. The cap is okay, but the price is high in my opinion. 12â‚¬ would be fair, but you know your costs.\nMugs. No complaints; fair price and good quality.\nMy business experience was a good one. I would buy from you again.\nBest regards", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:00:43.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

He was not helpful at all. He said he will contact the ware house manager and it will be sorted in two three days. I asked him what should I do in the mean time. He answered as suggestion that in the mean time I should manage some other way. It's only small brush missing out of order. I think it was so unprofessional behaviour of him. THan on the second call Laura Walsh answered my call. And Laura was very helpful. She told me the process, and I did that. She also promised that she will sort this out today. Which she did. I have the tracking number already. I think you should have a staff like Laura Walsh. Not like the other man, I don't know his name but my call time was 13.06 today.\nThanks.

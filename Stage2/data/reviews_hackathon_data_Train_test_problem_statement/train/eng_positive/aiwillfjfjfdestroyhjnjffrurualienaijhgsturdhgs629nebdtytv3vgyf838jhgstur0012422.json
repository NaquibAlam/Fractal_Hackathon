I missed a few cancellations and they refunded my money to me. And now they have a new section for Plus Sizes! After all, we big girls want to look cute while we slim down as well. So I give them 4 stars. I would give 5 stars, but the website is a little slow and difficult to use. After adding something to the cart, you don't go back to the page you were on, you have to start your search over - a little frustrating.\nOverall, still a member, so still very happy with the quality of the product. I play volleyball and I need sturdy workout equipment that is easy to care for. Everything is machine washable and does not shrink or stretch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T04:28:23.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

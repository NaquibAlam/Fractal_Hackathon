I had the chance to try them on and immediately fell in love! They are so comfortable and, better yet, secure! I don't constantly have to pull them up and they do a really nice job with holding my tummy/legs steady while I run! 10/10 would definitely recommend! I am 5'10 and wear a L - XL in most clothing, so finding leggings that fit and are attractive is rare. These are perfect and make me feel much more confident in the gym!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T19:11:52.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

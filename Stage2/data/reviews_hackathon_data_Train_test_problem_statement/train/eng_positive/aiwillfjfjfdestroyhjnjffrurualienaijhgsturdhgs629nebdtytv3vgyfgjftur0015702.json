I proceeded to purchase from my iOS device and was able to make the purchase, but not without navigating a site that's clearly not formatted for mobile devices. Boxes were being truncated in portrait view; landscape corrected it, but of course, text was smaller. Pages would reload with warnings when fields contained errors, but correction required the page to completely reload(with the field already filled, leaving you wondering what is wrong). Page loading was slow and cumbersome. I ordered Tuesday and the lenses arrived the following Monday. Shipping was fast and free! OptiContacts.com has aggressively sought my opinion on the process, so I think they care about my experience. I will order from OptiContacts.com again, but I hope they will make their site more mobile-friendly in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T19:48:27.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

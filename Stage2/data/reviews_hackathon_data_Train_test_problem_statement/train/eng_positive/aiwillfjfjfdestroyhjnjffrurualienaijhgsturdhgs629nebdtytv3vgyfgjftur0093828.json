I got amazing photo and video updates of my dogs making friends with the Tiny Town residents, playing in her yard, and having a blast at the dog park. There wasn't a second I was worried about them. When she dropped them off (which was so amazing) they were clean, happy, and even had some homemade dog treats and a few printed photos from their Vacay. I will absolutely be using Adria for all my future Vacay needs!

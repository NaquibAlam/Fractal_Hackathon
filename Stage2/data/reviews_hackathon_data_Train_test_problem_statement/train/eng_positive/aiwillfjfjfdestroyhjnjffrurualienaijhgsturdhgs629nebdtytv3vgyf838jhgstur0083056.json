The faces of the cabinets are top notch. I would rate them a 5 if the backs were a bit better constructed. I only bought vanities from them but they didn't have a strip across the upper back to attach them to the wall good. The strip that was there was really low and flimsy in my opinion. I added the 1x4 across it and added some corner bracing...simple stuff which made it way better. I also glued everything even though it wasn't needed. Not sure how kitchen cabinets were constructed though.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T12:43:54.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

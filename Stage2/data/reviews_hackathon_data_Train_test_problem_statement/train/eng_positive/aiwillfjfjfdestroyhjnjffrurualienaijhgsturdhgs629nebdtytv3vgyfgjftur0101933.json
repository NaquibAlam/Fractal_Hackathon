I travelled to the Netherlands and visited Ace's shop. The entire process was delightful and the team at Ace impressed me, greatly.\nA few weeks after, I noticed that the watch stopped working and there was an issue. I was reasonably upset and contacted Ace immediately to get a full refund.\nThe response from Ace was one that I have never experienced and had thought was the thing of legends. The team contacted me back very quickly and put me in contact with, not only the owner of the store, but also one of the owners of Bremont. Both personally communicated with me and offered to take care of the issue in any way possible. I was in love with the watch and heartbroken there was an issue. This in combination with the care and concern shown by all turned me around. The new replacement watch was delivered to my home in a matter of days. I was informed every step of the way from return to new watch.\nAce is the best and I will never need to visit another watch store. Bremont is also a wonderful company to work with.

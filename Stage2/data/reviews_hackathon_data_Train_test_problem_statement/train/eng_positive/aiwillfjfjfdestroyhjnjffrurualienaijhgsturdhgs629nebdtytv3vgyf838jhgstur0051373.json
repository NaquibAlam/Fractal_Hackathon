I feel merrily ripped off by the combo of Menulog and Eat now. I phoned both companies and held for over 20 minutes before giving up - will try again later - and my responses to their confirmation emails have of course bounced back. If I could rate zero stars I would!\nUpdate: I finally got through to Menulog who were great. Menulog and Eat Now are the same company so the had all my details and could see their mistake. They refunded me the cost of one of my orders, which I was happy about. Now I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 4 because of the great way they dealt with their mistake!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T13:57:05.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

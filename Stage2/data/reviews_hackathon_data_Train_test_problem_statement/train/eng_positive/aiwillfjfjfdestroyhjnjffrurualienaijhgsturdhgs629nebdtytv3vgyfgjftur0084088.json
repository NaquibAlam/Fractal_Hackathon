Quickly answered questions submitted by email, usually within minutes of submission, even on Sunday night. They transferred 2 cars from other locations so we could look at 3 options all at once at closest location. This was done the very next day after requesting it. The cars are in great condition, with low mileage. No hassles or pressure, even though we were there at closing time. Very happy with the service we received and the car we bought.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:06:17.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

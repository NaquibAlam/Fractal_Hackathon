It's the small things...I was greeted, well informed about my options and my instructions were crystal clear. I learned how to save money and what to expect. I didn't feel like the customer service rep was a robot! This was a humanist experience. I am renting storage, not an apartment nor house!\nI don't want to feel like I'm buying a home! Other storages play with pricing, and I've experienced homeowners insurance fees, sign up fees and special lock fees! Fee after fee \"gimmicks\" make me upset! This is why, I chose Choice Storage. They can relate. I got on the phone, listened to the details from the same person I spoke to when I called. I didn't deal with a call center.

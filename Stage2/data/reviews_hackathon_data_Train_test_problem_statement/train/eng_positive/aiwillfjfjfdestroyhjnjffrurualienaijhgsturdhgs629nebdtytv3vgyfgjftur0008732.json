When I went back to re-order, the item is out of stock. I then saw the same on their eBay page in stock...so I tried via eBay, went to checkout, item out of stock. Went back to the site, suddenly it's back in-stock. After playing this game of tennis, I finally managed to order and delivery was next day.\nCountry Attire took the item back and in-between delivery and returns, I had support contact me checking up on the issues I had the previous night.\nCan't complain, the whole returns process was problem free and quick. Will purchase to keep next time from CA!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T09:06:07.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

WOW very impressed with their program and format. I called customer service unsure about some of the features and talked with Rebecca. She really knows the system and how it functions . Rebecca walked me through the yes and no questions also explained the importance of using the skill keyword box will that will target the candidates that I actually need for my position. ZipRecruiter is MUCH MUCH more than a place to post your help wanted ad. You really should call Rebecca at customer service to walk you through your postings it's amazing!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T18:17:32.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

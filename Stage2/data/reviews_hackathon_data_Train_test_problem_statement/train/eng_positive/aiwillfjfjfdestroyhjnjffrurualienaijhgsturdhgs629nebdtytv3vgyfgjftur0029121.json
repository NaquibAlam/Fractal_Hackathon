Their ordering system online was easy to use and everything I needed was easy to find, I was shocked at how cheap everything was, I was worried my salon was going to be empty and bare until I was able to purchase shock to full it but thanks to AMR they had everything under control and I need not to worry. The delivery was so quick I couldnt believe my order had arrived that quickly and everything I had ordered was there, it was unbelievable.\nThanks AMR I will only be making my purchases for my salon through you, theres no need to go anywhere else when you have service like that why would you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:14:08.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

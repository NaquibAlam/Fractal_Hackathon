Didn't cost much and I didn't expect much either but this was the only place I could find any replacements. Ordering was super easy and I quickly got an email that the items had shipped. Within several days, they showed up at the front door. The quality was better than expected and the fit was perfect. Its nice to know that Eagle Optics treats a small customer like a big customer.

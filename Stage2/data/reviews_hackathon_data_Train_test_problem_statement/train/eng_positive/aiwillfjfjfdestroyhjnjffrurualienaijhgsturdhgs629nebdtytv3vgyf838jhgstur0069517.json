Their shipping from Oregon was amazingly quick! Received in Washington the day after ordering! I purchased the 8 Frame English Garden Hive and am very pleased with it. It is beautiful, but I can not give it full marks due to the corner construction of the boxes. The first time I handled one I could hear it creaking. They use a combination of rabbit and tongue and groove, which sounds like it might be sturdy. Unfortunately the groove is so close to the end of the board and the tongue so thin that is fairly weak. If they were glued they might be sufficient, but they are not, so I rate it 7 out of 10. I would give it 10 out of 10 if the corners were made with finger joints. I will reinforce the corners, but that should not be required. Although I would prefer the cypress wood I will order additional supers in pine with finger joints in the future for the added strength. From Brushy Mountain of course. Great service!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T23:30:53.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Great customer service on 5 Omega agencies I went through during my trip from North to South, very helpful and nice at anytime, cheaper than others and no problems with any of my 3 cars. Feeling that they are not trying to take some money from you but that you pay for the service and for what it is. Shuttles right on time, free, nice drivers, out of the crowded terminals.\nThanks", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:01:12.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

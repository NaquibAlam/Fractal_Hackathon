Lovely colours, I ordered the chilli and it's a lovely dark red suitable for my little boy. Waiting for baby to arrive before I can use it but it's fully assembled ready. Each component fits into frame easily and frame folds down easily. Haven't tried car seat and isofix base but hoping that's easy to install in car. Very pleased for price, looks very expensive. Thanks so much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T08:27:32.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Usually, my sister would keep her for me but, one time, she had plans during that time. I searched and searched for someone but, most of the places I found would have your pet in a small cage or kennel with no one around for 23 hours a day. That was not acceptable to me and, I almost cancelled my plans again. Then I found DogVacay. I had no idea there was a network of real people who would take your dog into their homes and treat them like a guest. This is the greatest thing! I've used a \"host\" named Darin five times now. He's great! He sends texts with pictures and an occasional video to let me know how Lexi is doing. I get something very important from DogVacay and, that's peace of mind. I honestly don't feel like I need to worry about Lexi while we're out of town. If you need to go out of town and, you can't take your dog, you've got to try it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T13:24:29.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They have a good selection of books to choose from, great deals, and a rewards program. I have bought used books locally in the past and found Thrift Books' condition ratings and definitions very accurate. I enjoy having a Wish List and being notified when an item becomes available. Ordering is fast and easy. The shipping is quick and the cost is excellent. I have no complaints, only kudos! Keep up the excellent work, Thrift Books! :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T03:00:56.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

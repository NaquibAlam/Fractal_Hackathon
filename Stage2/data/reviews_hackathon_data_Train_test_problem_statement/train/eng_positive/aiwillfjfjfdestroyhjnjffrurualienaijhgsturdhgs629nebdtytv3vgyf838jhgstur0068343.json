I am short and this compounds this issue too. I damage my wheel rims often as I course too close to roundabout edges etc. However even though Mick's Garage could not source them for me Laura's help was tremendous and she has gone out of her way simply to apologise for noit having what i was looking for and to help me try and get what i am looking for elsewhere. I believe Laura is a tremendous asset to your firm and I am very grateful to her for the help I have received so far. Thank YOU Laura!

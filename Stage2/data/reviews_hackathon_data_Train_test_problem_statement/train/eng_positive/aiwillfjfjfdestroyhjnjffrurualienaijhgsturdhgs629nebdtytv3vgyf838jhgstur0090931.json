I have been using RentalCars.com both in the UK and abroad for a few years now and have always found them to be both fair and efficient in their operation.\nI do wish the same could be said of some of the car rental agencies, some of whom are less than efficient and lacking in that certain customer service quality that I think is important. Our most recent experience with Europcar at Bristol Airport is a case in point, where we were allocated a car in the correct group, but it was sub-standard in other respects (I have already made this known to Europcar).\nThe other point I would like to make is the confusion I have over the damage waiver insurance that is applied. You include an indemnity insurance to cover this which I usually take up, but the rental agencies also have their own indemnities which they try to sell you at point of hire.\nClarification of this process would be very much appreciated.\nThank you.\nJohn Cox", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T17:56:04.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My first experience with them I purchased a 2012 Hyundai Elantra. The car was clean and ran well! Rupert gave me the best customer service and was very helpful and on top of finding me the best fit for my budget and my taste. One year later I was in an accident and thanks to Rupert stressing the importance of GAP protection I was covered 100% and put in a 2015 Chrysler with no money down! I am very happy with drive time and have even referred family, where I was credited $200 for my referral. I recommend trying them out and asking for Rupert he's awesome!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:45:17.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The first time I went with a full digi-pack, and the second time I opted for just discs (because I'm broke).\nBut both times, the results were great, and their website is fantastic and user-friendly. It's easy to upload your stuff, and they offer proofs as you go, you can save your project, and the sales reps that reach out to you are pretty friendly and low-pressure (and don't nag too much).\nBig fan! If you're like me and have love for CDs despite their being sort of obsolete, this is my top choice for getting some discs printed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T02:03:39.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

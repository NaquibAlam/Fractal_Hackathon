The communication was straight forward with various e-mails keeping up abreast of the order progress. As we were in no particular hurry, we opted for the slower delivery option, which again was fine. We then received the e-mail to say that goods were dispatched along with a link to the carriers tracking details. On the day of delivery I remained in to take delivery. This is where it went down hill, at around lunch time I checked the delivery status, only to find out it had been delivered to a \"neighbour\", which was interesting seeing as I was sat working next the entry door and the neighbour was someone I didn't know in a completely different part of the street. Of course no card through the door, because they were never at the door! As annoying as this was, I of course can't blame Clothes2order.com, they like a lot of businesses, put their faith in carriers to actually do the job, for which they have been paid to do. As for the clothing it is very good and the embroidery, is excellent. 4 stars is harsh, it really should be 4.5 stars and would absolutely been 5, but for the carrier. Well worth taking a look at their site, an expansive range with bigger sizes available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T23:12:58.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

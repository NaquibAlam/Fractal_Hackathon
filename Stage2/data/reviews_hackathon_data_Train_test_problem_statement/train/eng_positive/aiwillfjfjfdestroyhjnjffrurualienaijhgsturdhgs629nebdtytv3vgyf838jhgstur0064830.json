Obviously being hot headed about it at the time i didn't think to ask calmly to someone about what had happened. But in the end i was personally messaged and turned out it was a shipping error but the manager had taken care of me and fixed my order and got it shipped and delivered within a week. I really appriciate how professionally she handled the situation and how fast she solved the problem. I loved the shoes, very cute and so did my daughters! I will defiantly order here again soon, and recommend to friends, family and anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T06:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T20:01:59.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

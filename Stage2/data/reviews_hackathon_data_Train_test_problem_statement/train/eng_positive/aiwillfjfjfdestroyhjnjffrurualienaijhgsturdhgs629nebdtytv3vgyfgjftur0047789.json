The painting is big and bold and exactly what I needed to give my lounge room a lift. It came beautifully and meticulously packaged in a wooden crate with plenty of bubble wrap and foam to protect the artwork. Saatchi organised the shipping and I did not have to lift a finger! Would definitely recommend this site for buying original artworks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T21:06:52.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

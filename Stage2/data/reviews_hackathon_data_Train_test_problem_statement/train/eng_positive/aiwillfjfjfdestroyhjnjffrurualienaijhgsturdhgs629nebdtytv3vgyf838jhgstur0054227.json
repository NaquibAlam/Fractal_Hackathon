The check lists online were very helpful. I paid for 2 day processing and had forgotten about a holiday being on Monday and they actually refunded $50 into my account. I received my passport in perfect timing along with my information. My only issue was I had emailed 3 or 4 times with no response but Domenique G responded every time and answered all my questions. She was very polite and helpful! They even sent me the tracking # so I could keep up with it.\nThanks to the entire team at Fastport Passport!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T12:00:55.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

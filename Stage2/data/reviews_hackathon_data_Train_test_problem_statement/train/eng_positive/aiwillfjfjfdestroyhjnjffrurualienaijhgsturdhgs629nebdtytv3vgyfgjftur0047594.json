They have a large variety of dishes to choose from, and new dishes are always added. They are very flavorful and easy to prepare - usually it only takes 2-3 minutes in the microwave to heat up. They often come with additional condiments.\nOne thing I like is the ability to choose an hour window for delivery, and then the ability to track the progress of the delivery driver. I can be waiting at the door when he/she drives up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:28:58.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

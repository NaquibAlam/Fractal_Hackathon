I love their notification system, the want list and options to buy different priced comics. To me that's the best part. I don't buy a lot of different genre comics, so I don't know about their selection for, say Marvel or series like The Walking Dead or Batman. I buy Buffy mostly and occasionally other things that catch my eye.\nWhen I buy Buffy I love the option of picking a cover, and even picking a price. I've bought a comic as low as $1.40 and it was in excellent shape. Nice I had that option instead of a $3.99 or higher base. I have bought 20 or more at a time. I think this store is a great choice if you are searching around and price comparing. You might be able to get some things here cheaper and have more selection than elsewhere. Great store. Their website could be a little jazzier with more pizazz, but overall very easy and simple to use. Packaging and shipping are awesome too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:13:48.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

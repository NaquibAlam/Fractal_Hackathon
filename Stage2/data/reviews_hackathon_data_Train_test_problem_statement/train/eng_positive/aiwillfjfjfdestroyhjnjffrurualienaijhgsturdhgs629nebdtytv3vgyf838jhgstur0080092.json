My tire had a screw in it and had gone flat. I was able to put air in it, but needed it replaced right away.\nPascoe was very helpful and friendly and didn't make me feel pressured or uncomfortable as a walk in. The cost was fair and the time it took was agreeable. I was in and out a lot faster than I anticipated. I WILL be purchasing all my tires from there from now on.

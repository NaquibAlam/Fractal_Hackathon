The right book was sent but the wrong edition which was more than just an updated version of the same book. Some 96 pages have been added to the book and more documents. As history buff and a researcher, this was important to me. I brought this to their attention as soon as I discovered the error and they responded in less than 24 hours. They apologized immediately and instead of making excuses why they sent the wrong book, they acknowledged their error and even though they could not fulfill my specific request for this 3rd edition, they told me to keep the book and they would issue a complete refund anyway. WOW!!! Talk about customer service!!! I won't hesitate buying from them in the future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:52:55.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

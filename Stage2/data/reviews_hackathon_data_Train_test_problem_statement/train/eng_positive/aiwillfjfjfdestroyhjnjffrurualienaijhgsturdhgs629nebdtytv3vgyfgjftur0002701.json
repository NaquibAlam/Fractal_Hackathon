My conundrum was that the tyres on my car varied in wear, front pair around 2mm tread available, rear around 4mm but one tyre with a unrepairable tear. The spare unused and in excellent condition. I compared prices with various providers, tyresonthedrive offered the best value options and the service meant there was no need to use the spare and travel. consequently I decided to change all four tyres. I followed the instructions, ordered the tyres and decided on the delivery option - simple. I was allocated a delivery time, I recieved good communications and the engineer rang 15 minutes before arrival (he was also early). He cracked on and completed the work in around an hour, no fuss, no issues and all at a good price. I have no hesitation in recommending this service and company and willl use again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:40:03.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

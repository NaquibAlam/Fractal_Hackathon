All the members I interacted with including Neha, Michael and Ammy proved outstanding in their understanding of my needs and giving solutions.\nNeha not only ensured I got the best flight, but also the price. She kept patience and understanding when after few hours of working out tickets I withdrawn due to genuine reasons.\nMichael was quick to book next day ticket for my emergency travel on 30-Dec\nAfter sales customer support from Ammy excellent. She helped generate invoices.\nMy experience is travelpod is no-nonsense service.

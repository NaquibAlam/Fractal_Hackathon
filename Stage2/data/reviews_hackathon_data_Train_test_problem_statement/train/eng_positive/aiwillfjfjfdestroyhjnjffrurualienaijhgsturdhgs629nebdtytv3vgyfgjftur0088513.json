(Every other website was at least twice as much) When the manufacturer delayed the date they emailed me right away with the new date and a possibility to choose a case they had in stock. They were very friendly and apologized authentically for the delay. Upon arrival they shipped it to me so that I had my case the next day. What a great customer service! The prices as well as the variety of brand new products is absolutely awesome. Thank you MobilFun!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:38:17.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

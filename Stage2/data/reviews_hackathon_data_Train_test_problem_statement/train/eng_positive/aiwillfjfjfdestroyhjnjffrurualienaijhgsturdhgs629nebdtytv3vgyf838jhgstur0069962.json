I have never been comfortable being away from my pup for any length of time, now I can leave for months at a time if need be for work, family emergency, or holiday travel, though I still miss my pup dearly, Annie always offers face-time, sends tons of updates, and I know without a doubt my pup is in the most loving and capable hands. Annie supervises 24/7, which is required for my pup, provides all the extra care and love at no additional charge, which is unheard of, whether it be treating pre-existing conditions with homeopathic remedies my vet had been unsuccessful in treating, bathing, applying natural preventatives, sending home made bbq jerky treats, or refusing to take additional payment for a last minute request, early drop off, late pick up etc., this is clearly more than a job with Annie and is absolutely her passion. I firmly believe Annie would provide care for no charge at all if there weren't so many willing to pay for her services, and she does for many as she is very involved in rescue...she provides an amazing value and doesn't come near the traditional costs, I couldn't put a price on the quality of care she provides! Annie is a Godsend! Your dog is not only a guest at Annie's but a family member and even after the stay has ended, Annie's care has not. My dog has been staying at Annie's since a puppy, its been years now, and couldn't imagine leaving with anyone else. Reserve early on as she books up fast!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T13:13:26.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This time, however, I got a a set of brake pads that made noise right out of the box. I did everything correctly as far as break in and installation (i.e. made sure new rotors and pads were clean, wire brushed rust from all metallic sliding surfaces, greased slide pins and tabs, greased brake pad shims, etc.) but they still made noise. I contacted customer service twice over the weekend and got a quick response that following Monday. After a talk with their technician the pads were ruled faulty, so I was sent a brand new set that just arrived today (about a week later). I'm a little upset that I have to reinstall new pads, but overall I'm very happy with the way my situation was handled. I'll definitely order my brake parts here again.\nUpdate: I installed my new set of pads about a week and a half ago and they have been very quiet so far. Additionally, the stopping power is better than factory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:20:08.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

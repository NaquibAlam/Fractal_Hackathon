I like working on my bikes in the back yard rather than take them down to the local bike shop.\nI'm very impressed with the Reid Condor, all the reviews were fair and I knew what was to be expected.\nI ordered on a Tuesday Night and the bike arrived Thursday lunch time.\nPut the bike together over the weekend and what a ride it is. It's the most solid and smoothest bike I've ridden to date. Sure there's purists out there that will say there's better and I'm sure there is, but for the budget I'm on I couldn't be happier.\nThank You.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T13:11:42.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

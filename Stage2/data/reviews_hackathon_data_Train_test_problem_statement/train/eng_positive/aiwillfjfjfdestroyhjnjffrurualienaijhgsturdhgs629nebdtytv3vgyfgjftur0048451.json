Until I came across Lola. After reading about how store brand tampons can be pumped with chemicals and thinking about all the times in my life that I have used these store brand tampons shook me up a little. After plenty of research I stepped out of my store brand comfort zone and decided to try Lola. Now I am hooked and want everyone to know about this brand. The product is comfortable and does what it needs to do. I love that this company and the creatures are looking out for women and our health. I am so happy that I branched out and tried Lola! I am now a believer!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:20:51.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

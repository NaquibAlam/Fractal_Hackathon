Everything out there from Costco to other camera suppliers seemed both vague in there descriptions and poorly made from their reviews, I accidentally stumbled upon SCW's website, began reading and was very impressed with the way they presented all the products for you on their website, I learned a great deal. Made several phone calls prior to committing to purchase, each time my questions were answered fully, not in a rushed manner, each time making sure I fully understood what I was buying and what it would do. After receiving and installing cameras (very easy set up) I needed to call support, NOT DUE to any type of flaw on the equipments part, it was my lack of knowledge with all things electronic...Made two calls to support, for issues I created, again the people I spoke with were very professional, understood what I was calling for, gave explanations to me and actually gave me a little training (5-10 minutes) on the system and how to better use it. So at this point this is an American based company, with American support who take ownership of their equipment and back up their statements as for as after sales support. I'm so pleased with my experience I have just purchase another two cameras, more of their high end cameras to go with my system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T13:41:34.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

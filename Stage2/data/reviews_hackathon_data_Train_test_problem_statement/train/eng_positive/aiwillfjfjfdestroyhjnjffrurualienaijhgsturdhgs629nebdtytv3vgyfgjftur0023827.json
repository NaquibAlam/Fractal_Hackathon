I received an email a few days later from customer service, specifically Solan, concerning my order, stating that they were out of that model in green. Besides the typical cancellation and refund, I was not only offered the choice of that same model in different color PLUS a $20 refund, but I was offered the choice to upgrade to the Flowermate V5os Pro at no additional cost. I took them up on the upgrade, and they even upgraded my shipping! I had my goods in two days! And to top it all off, they enclosed the higher quality freebies you get when you actually order the Pro. All of that because they didn't have the original model in a color I ordered. They went above and beyond customer service. I would've been fine with them just shipping the vape I ordered in a different color, but they wanted to make absolutely sure I would be satisfied, and I am. POTV's got a repeat customer in me, and I've already rec'd them to my friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T14:12:43.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Then, we met SANDEEP. He immediately stood out from the crowd (not just in this shop but throughout all of the Jewellery quarter). His knowledge, expertise and customer service was second to none. He knew exactly what we wanted and did not pressure us at any point to make a sale. He gave us all the information we needed, made us a great offer for a great diamond and allowed us to make a well informed decision.\nI did not trust a lot of the sales personnel at the Jewellery Quarter but Sandeep was different. He was very genuine and even advised us against getting one of his slightly more expensive diamonds as we were unlikely to see any difference in the ring quality once at home... He was right!\nThe ring was delivered on time as promised with no issues at all. He even arranged for a platinum ring to be made in the style of one we had seen at a different shop. We sent him pictures of the style we wanted and the one he had made was even better than we could have imagined.\nExcellent shop. Great staff. The best diamonds.\nAsk for Sandeep!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T07:29:44.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

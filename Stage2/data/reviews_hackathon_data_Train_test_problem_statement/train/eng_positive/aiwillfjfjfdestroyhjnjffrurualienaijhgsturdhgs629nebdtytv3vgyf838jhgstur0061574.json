Our sitters bought their own little dog with them and she fitted in so well with our own 3 dogs. I would truly recommend TH's as an alternative to boarding as well as looking after our dogs, our house was in safe hands too. I didn't have any of the normal concerns for our dogs and house whilst I was away.

Both had detailed customer requirements and both had good products on offer - high standard invertors and panels. Thanks to this site I also found other sites which reviewed the panels and invertors which supported the cases. Both were almost dollar for dollar. I went with Solartec purely on the solar panels' manufacturer's financial health and history, counting on future support if required (hopefully never). Solartec installed efficently and without hassle (found a few cracked tiles for me though that I had to replace - good to them for pointing it out). I went for higher end of both purely for the sake of longevity of performance (power output) - no diminishing efficiency of panels and no reliability issues with invertors. I would recommend either company depending on preference. I am a maintenance Engineer myself so I put value on longevity and performance and paid some extra for it.

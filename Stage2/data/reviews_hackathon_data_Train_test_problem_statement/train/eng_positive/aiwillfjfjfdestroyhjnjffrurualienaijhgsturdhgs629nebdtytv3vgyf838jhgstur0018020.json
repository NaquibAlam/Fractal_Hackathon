FlightHub had the lowest rates out of all of the other sites I checked and when I clicked on a flight it didn't direct me to another website or even change the price like I witnessed with some of the other flight finder sites. The booking process was easy and simple and I was done within minutes of finding my flight. 10/10 would recommend FlightHub to anyone looking to get a flight for a reasonable price and with no booking hassle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:57:42.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

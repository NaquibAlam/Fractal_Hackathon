I have been without a car for the past few months and it has dreadful. I was driving past auto lenders this weekend and took a quick drive through the lot, and saw a nice sonata, but did not act on it until later the day, i decided to reach out and schedule a test drive in the coming days. Long story short- auto lenders immediately responded to my inquiry and i came in that same afternoon, it was after 5 by the time i got there and they had no problem staying to help me even though they were technically closed. I test drove the sonata, i was helped by Chris Langley, whom did a Spectacular job making me feel comfortable. I am a person that is solely driven by feelings and the vibes i pick up. At auto lenders it was their utmost compassion and desire to see me attain the best car That was very important to me, never did i feel pressured or doubt the process and their authenticity. Upon returning with the sonata i realized perhaps i wanted a coupe, i told Chris i was not married to the sonata. He asked me what my dream was - i said black coupe leather sun roof back up cam low mileage under $18,000. He quickly typed some things into his laptop turned it around and had 3 black Honda accords... i picked 1 out---he pulled her up and away i went (ANOTHER IMPORTANT DETAIL WAS THEY ALLOW YOU TO TEST DRIVE THE VEHICLES YOURSELF, GIVE YOU THE PERSONAL TIME TO BOND WITH THE CAR AND BE COMFORTABLE)\nI came back from my test drive and LOVED THE CAR !!! It had under 30 K mileage, all leather black interior, push to start, touch screen, back & SIDE CAM, heated seats, sunroof, fin, led lights, THE FULL OUT WORKS !!! Never had i been able to afford and obtain a car such as this . Auto Lenders made that POSSIBLE !!! I am so Grateful and i strongly recommend to all those out there looking for the the BEST to give auto lenders the opportunity to show you how the best work !!!\nGod Bless <3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T23:30:56.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

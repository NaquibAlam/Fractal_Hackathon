We worked with Felicia, and she was great. During our planning phase, she was very approachable and yet did not push. My wife and I were planning our honeymoon, and we thought Costa Rica would be the place do it. We came across Costa Rican Vacations just by internet search and chance. We could not have gone wrong. With a little bit of our input, Felicia planned out an awesome experience. Everything and everyone from the concierge to the hotels, from the shuttle drivers to the tours; were all professional, helpful, and a great experience. Thank you to you and your team for a most memorable honeymoon. The worst part was having to come home... Pura Vida!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:59:48.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

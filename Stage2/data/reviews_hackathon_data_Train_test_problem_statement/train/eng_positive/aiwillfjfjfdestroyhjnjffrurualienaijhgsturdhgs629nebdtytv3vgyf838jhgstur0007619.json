The template itself has more than I need so I needed to \"unpublish\" some pages. Some sections, or \"modules,\" were hard for me to locate so I went on to Chat Support.\nShe was very understanding of my confusion/frustration with my learning where things were in the administrator's dashboard. She offered screen shots when she found what I had questions about, which I am quite impressed by.\nI would definitely recommend her support and TemplateMonster to anyone needing to build their own website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T06:38:22.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

As one of our pups is a rescue, we were so concerned with a kennel because she literally freaks out when something closely resembles that environment. So when I stumbled across this website on the internet, it seemed almost too good to be true!\nAfter looking through the list of potential sitters, we decided upon Lais and Shane. We were then able to do a meet and greet prior to the pups stay to make sure it was a good fit for everyone.\nDuring our trip we received updates on our furbabies several times a day through texts, photos, videos and even FaceTimeðŸ˜‚\nIt is also affordable! Each sitter sets their own prices and you know, and pay the fee up front. I HIGHLY recommend Lais (our sitter), and this service!!\nOh! And did I mention there's even a user friendly, well integrated app?\nLOVE!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T22:02:58.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have also been a driver for one of Lyft's main competitors. Don't think I need mention the name. I have always been able to sort out issues I've had while working with Lyft through their support team as well as even going to one of their Lyft driver hubs in San Francisco. The service from the drivers standpoint is unmatched by any other service. I absolutely love Lyft and all my passengers seem to love it too! Couldn't give it any more praise if I tried. Keep sticking it to the man Lyft. You rule!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:14:39.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

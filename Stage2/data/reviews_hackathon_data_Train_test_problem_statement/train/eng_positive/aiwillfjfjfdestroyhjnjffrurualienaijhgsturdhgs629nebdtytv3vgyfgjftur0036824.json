He walks every day, still drives and gets out & about on his 12 acres. We purchased a watch phone two years ago that would track him, make SOS calls, take incoming calls etc. He finally got on top of the technology and all was well until he had to upgrade to a new watch due to Telstra closing their 2G System.\nHe struggled for 2 months, but the upgraded watch was too technically sophisticated for him to grasp the concepts to operate it. Also, the watch phone malfunctioned & had to be returned on three occasions.\nSo we were delighted when we found the KISA phone!\nThis is how the KISA phone compares:-\n1. Every operation on the KISA phone is straightforward & simple,\nfor example-\na) KISA turns off in one step - the watch phone took 4 steps\nb) my father can press one large button to make a call on his\nKISA phone - his fingers were too large to make calls on\nthe watch phone.\n2. The KISA phone can not only be used to make calls, but it will also track my fathers location. The GPS Tracker was our prime reason for going with the Watch phone initially. (We wish we had known about the KISA phone back then!) The Watch phone is mainly for tracking with only 6 mins each month available for phone calls. With the KISA phone my father now has a greater peace of mind knowing that he can call any of us when he is out & about because he has 75mins on his plan & he can press one button to make the call.\n3. KISA User Manual is simple and easy to follow - my father had no trouble understanding the instructions and operating the KISA phone without any input from me.\n4. KISA phone battery lasts for a few days - even with the GPS Tracker set to 15 min intervals. The watch phone ate battery power so much that it would run down after several hours if set to 15 min intervals.\n5. The KISA phone GPS Tracker page opens with the location times listed. The map opens beside the time box by simply clicking on a time- both satellite & street maps are available. Whereas the watch phone GPS Tracker is very complicated to use, requiring many more steps that don't give as good a result.\nCongratulations to the KISA phone team - it is obvious that you have developed the KISA phone with total consideration from the User's perspective; in our opinion you have thought of everything. I am happy that my father is happy with his KISA phone and cannot thank you enough - life is simple again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T23:15:39.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

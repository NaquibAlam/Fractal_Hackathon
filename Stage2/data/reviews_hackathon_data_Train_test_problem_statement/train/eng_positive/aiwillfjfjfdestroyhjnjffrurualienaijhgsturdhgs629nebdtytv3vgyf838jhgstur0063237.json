Parcel monkey did deliver the parcel in an excellent shape. The envelope looked like new according to my mom. And the price was a very reasonable 25$, between 1000% and 240% cheaper. I had some concern at some point not being able to track the parcel but after leaving a message I was contacted withing the same day with a tracking link. Would ship again. I am having serious doubts regarding some evaluations here. Seems like some big companies do not want to stop being able to abuse customers with outrageous pricing. To Quote: one of the reviews \"they are cheap you get what you pay for\". Well for starters 25$ isn't cheap I actually consider it the maximum amount acceptable for a small package les than 2lb and many countries won't dare charge you more for that. And 250$ to ship a package that is still less than 2lb, isn't normal pricing it's called theft.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T15:13:21.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My design consultant was Kathy Mays, and she was delightful to work with. She offered good suggestions for different options, was extremely patient with me and kept bringing out one sample book after another until I found just the right material for each window and slider. I most appreciated her willingness to do everything she could to help me stay within budget. I had to cut 2 of the most expensive items out of my order to stay within budget, and she didn't try to make me feel bad or pressure me into keeping those two shades. (Which I am hoping to order when finances allow.) Rusty, the installer, was also professional and efficient. He came on time, and the installation was very clean. They were also able to have my shades installed within their originally Quote: d time frame even though one of the materials I selected was on backorder. I am pleased with the look and quality of the shades, and they really make my home look finished. I would not hesitate to recommend Stoneside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T21:24:16.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

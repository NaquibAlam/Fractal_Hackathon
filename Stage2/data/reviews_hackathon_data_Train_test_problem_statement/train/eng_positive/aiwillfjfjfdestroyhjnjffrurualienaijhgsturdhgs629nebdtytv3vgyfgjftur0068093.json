The instructor provided ample opportunity for hands-on practice and gave good feedback. I believe everyone left there feeling confident in their new-found skills. However, I was hoping for more in depth coverage of first aid, including hands-on practice in applying bandages, splints, etc. One caveat: myself and another student received reminder e-mails the day before that lead us to believe we had to take and pass an on-line course before taking part in the classroom session. We both spent several hours completing the course, which meant that most of the classroom instruction, apart from the hands-on training, was redundant of what we learned on-line. Having said that, the on-line course was one of the better on-line trainings I've experienced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T22:29:55.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

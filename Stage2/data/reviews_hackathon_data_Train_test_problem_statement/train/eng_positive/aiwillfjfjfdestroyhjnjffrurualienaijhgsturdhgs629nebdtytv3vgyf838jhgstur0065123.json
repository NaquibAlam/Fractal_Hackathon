I did not receive a bill after over three months so I contacted Energia, they only have an 1890 number which meant I would have to pay extra for the call from my mobile phone so I sent an E mail. After a few days I received a reply that the bill had been posted. After a second e mail I got my account number and was able to sign up online and see my bill. I was very pleased that it matched the price I got on Bonkers. Overall I am happy with Energia but would be happier if they had an 01 number.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T09:39:11.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

No long wait to see the doctor. Dr. Danowitz was very friendly with both my cats and myself and very respectful to all of us. He explained everything he did and went over any tests or recommendations with me. He called me the next day for the result of the blood work on my first cat. I find him very pleasant, honest, and considerate and I would recommend him for any one looking for a trusted vet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:33:50.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They got back to me right away and said these would fit. I then ordered them and they came very quickly. They were easy to add to the Cruiser - perfect fit! Now my fun rides are even more comfortable.\nIn addition to great products, they clearly care a great deal about customer service. When I'm ready to replace my Cruiser, you can bet I'll be upgrading to a new TerraTrike.

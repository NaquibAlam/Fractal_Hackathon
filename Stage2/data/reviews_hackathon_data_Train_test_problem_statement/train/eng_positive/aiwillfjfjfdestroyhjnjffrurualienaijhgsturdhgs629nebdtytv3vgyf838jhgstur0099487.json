All they have to supply is there a drivers license, pictures of their car, Proof of insurance, and the registration. With Lyft, you have a four-day background check, a personal interview, Proof of your drivers license, insurance, and registration. So if you want to have a safe ride to get from A to B... which company do you think would be the wisest decision? I personally think it's a no-brainer.\nOn top of this, Lyft is an international company just the same as Uber. If you want to get in touch with Uber, you have to send them a email, and they will get in touch with you, if they want to get in touch with you. As a driver or as a passenger, there is a button on the Lyft app that says \"call me\". Within two seconds, no matter what time of day, a real live customer support representative will be there for you!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:11:22.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

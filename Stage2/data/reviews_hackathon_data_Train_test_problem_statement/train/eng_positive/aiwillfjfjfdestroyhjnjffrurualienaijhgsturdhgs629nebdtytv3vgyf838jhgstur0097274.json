Although ASAP ticket agent told that was not true . I traveled to Bucharest for dental work, because the dental work here is better than got in the USA. The prices are great around 374.00 for implant, less than 200.00 for root canals at DentArt great dentist. I rent apartment for month in Bucharest, the people are friendly, 25% speak English. I am in great location money exchange across the street, 50 feet from wonderful grocery store, and 4.2 KM to the Dentist. The dollar is strong here ! USD to LIE is 23 cent. 0% on money exchange. I have fresh Octopus form the grocery store. could not be happier I came to Bucharest. I rent from Ramona & Giuseppe, the have wonderful apartment in the city center, I wish every was as close for me to shop as it is here in Bucharest.\nLeave a comment if you wish to rent a place here and I tell you how to rent from this great.

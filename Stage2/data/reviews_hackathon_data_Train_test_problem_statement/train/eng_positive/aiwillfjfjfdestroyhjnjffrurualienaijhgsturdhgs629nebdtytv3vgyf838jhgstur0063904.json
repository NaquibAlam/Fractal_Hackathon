I started with an initial consultation with an optician. I was informed by him that because of my age 71 that lens replacement surgery would be the best course for me to follow. I agreed and I then had a subsequent consultation with my Surgeon Mr George. He carefully explained the procedure to me and I agreed to go ahead.\nThe operation was a complete success and I now have twenty twenty vision without glasses.\nI have had several follow up visits to the optician to check that everything was healing up properly and that both my eyes were functioning correctly\nMy next appointment will be in November 12 months after my operation\nFrom start to finish everyone was very professional.\nI wish I had done this sooner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T18:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:24:56.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

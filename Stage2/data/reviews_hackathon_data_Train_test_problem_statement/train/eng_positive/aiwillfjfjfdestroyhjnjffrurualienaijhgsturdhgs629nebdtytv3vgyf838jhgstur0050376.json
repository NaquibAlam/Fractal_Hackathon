We thought at least give it a go and if we had no luck we could involve a real estate agent.\nWe listed our home and the first few home opens we had no one come through. At the fourth we had a family who put an offer on our home subject to the sale of there house.\nUnfortunately they had no luck selling there home. We started more home opens and at the same time had 2 potential buys. In the end we accepted a cash offer and 4 weeks settlement.\nBy far the best experience we had selling our house. So glad that we didn't have to pay real estate agent fees.\nAnother bonus was we could choose our home open dates and times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T13:40:21.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

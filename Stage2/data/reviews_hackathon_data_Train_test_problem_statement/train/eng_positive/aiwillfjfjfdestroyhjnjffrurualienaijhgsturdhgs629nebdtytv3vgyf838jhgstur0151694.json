I have used the other company before, but I had heard great things about Blurb. I started creating the book in the other program, and it was a frustrating experience. I hopped over to Blurb, and I was delighted at how simple it was to put my pages together. A couple weeks later, the book arrived, and I am absolutely THRILLED with the quality. It is a gorgeous book, and it is very sturdy. I have no concerns that it won't hold up for many, many years. Can't wait to make more Blurb books!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:06:24.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Could be better if the small accessories like screws, lens plates, and clamps had actual dimensions listed. I had to order 2 different 1/4-20 D-ring screws as they were only listed as \"short\" and \"long.\" If the actual length were posted, I could have saved the need to return one. I just ordered an Arca-type quick release plate, but am not sure if it will fit in my clamp. There is no actual industry standard for Arca Swiss fittings so dimensions vary among manufacturers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T20:47:09.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

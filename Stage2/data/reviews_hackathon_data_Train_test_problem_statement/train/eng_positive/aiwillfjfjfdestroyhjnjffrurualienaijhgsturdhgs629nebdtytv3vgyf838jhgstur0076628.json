The quality of the cards they offer are sleek and of great design. It is so easy to navigate through the website and customise your own design or to choose from the vast collection they offer. I made an error when I submitted the card and only a few hours later after checkout, i realised the error. Their live chat agent was so understanding and helped me with my quest and fixed my error instantly. I look forward to dealing with them more in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T10:27:18.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

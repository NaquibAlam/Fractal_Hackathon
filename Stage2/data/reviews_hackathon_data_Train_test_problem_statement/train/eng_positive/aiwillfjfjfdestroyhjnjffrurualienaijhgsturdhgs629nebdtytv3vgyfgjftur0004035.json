This was a super service.\nArranged for TOTD to come out only a few days ago, and a confirmation email said 'You are booked in for fitting on 23/01/2017. We will email you with our estimated time of arrival in the morning'. An email came this morning at 8am confirming my slot of between 3.15pm and 5.15pm. But the fitter telephoned before 3pm apologising but it looked like he was going to be early which was nice, and was all done in about 20 minutes.\nThe fitter, Iain, was excellent - friendly, chatty, professional, and was happy to explain things to me as he was going along.\nIt's a free fitting service for 2+ tyres, but I happily paid the £8.99 for this service for just the one tyre.\nOh, and within 20 mins I'd received an email copy of the invoice, plus a rather nifty digital worksheet with my signature on it. Cool!\nAdmittedly, I didn't need the car over the weekend so I could put it back in the garage until the fitter came. It may be different if you need to use the car again quickly.\nNo hesitation in recommending TOTD so far. And for doing so, I have even got a £10 Amazon voucher waiting when a friend uses the service.

I give them 4 instead of 5 stars only because the \"harvest gold\" they advertise is not a good match for the classic color from the 60s and 70s. It's more \"harvest green\". In fact, the photos on the website show 2 different \"harvest golds\" depending on whether or not it's plastic or wood. The Avocado on the other hand is right on the money. So my experience was both good and bad. However, Faucet Town was very understanding and more than made me whole and I would not hesitate to order from them again. Nobody paid me to say that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:57:02.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

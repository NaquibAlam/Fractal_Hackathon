This was one of the few places where small sections could be bought. They were simple to fit with silicone and hardly visible from ground level, but have done their job admirably. I had a roofer working at the time and he fixed them in 5 minutes. The sections can also be snapped into shorter lengths, which was useful for fitting over the curved end-cap at the end of my roof.\nI was totally delighted with both the product and the service, as well as the very reasonable price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:18:59.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

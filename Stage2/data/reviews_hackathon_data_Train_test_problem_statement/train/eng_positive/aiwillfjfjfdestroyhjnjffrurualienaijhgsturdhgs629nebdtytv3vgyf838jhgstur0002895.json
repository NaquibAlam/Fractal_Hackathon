I was hesitant to buy a dress online without the ability to try it on, but the sizing chart was very accurate and customized to each dress. The description stated that the dress was in stock and would be shipped the next business day and it was. Ground shipping was very fast, and we received the dress two days from the order being shipped. The dress fit perfectly and my daughter is thrilled. We have a family wedding coming up and I will absolutely use PromGirl for those dresses as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:27:54.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Booking online was quick and easy and having the option to pay through paypal was great. I got all confirmation emails really quickly. I received a further email on the morning of the fitting giving an estimated time that the technician would arrive. I then got a phonecall from the technician to say he was on his way. When he arrived he was very polite and professional. Had 2 tyres fitted in no time. Would definitely recommend to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T14:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:28:41.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

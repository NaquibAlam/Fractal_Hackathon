My doctor once said I should try sitting under a bright light. I ignored him, figuring he was joking. As I aged I got worse. Long story short. I googled light therapy to see if it really exist. To my amazement it does. I read all about it, and different types of lights. They're costly. Alaska Northern Lights had the Aurora mini light. So since it was the cheapest and also portable, I ordered it. BEST THING I EVER HAVE DONE FOR MYSELF!!! I LOVE IT. My mood after 2 or 3 days improved from down and depressed to Happy to be here. Gray days do not exist any more. No need for antidepressants. Do not use it when the sun is shinning. I sit with it for 20 to 30 min. 3 to 4 mornings a week if its over cast. Any more than that is to much for me. I learned how much time I need with it by the way I was feeling. Its amazing that sitting with this light for a short time can make me feel so happy for a day or 2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T04:43:17.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

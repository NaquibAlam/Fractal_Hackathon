A quick google search came up with World of Watch. I knew very little about them, but took a chance as they seemed credible. I was more than pleasantly surprised. One look at their website and their friendly faces was enough to put me at ease. They kept me informed of when the order was shipped and provided tracking. It was all very professional and detailed (they provided a picture of my parcel). The band arrived in perfect shape and I had it put on . It looks like new. I am very pleased!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T22:57:32.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

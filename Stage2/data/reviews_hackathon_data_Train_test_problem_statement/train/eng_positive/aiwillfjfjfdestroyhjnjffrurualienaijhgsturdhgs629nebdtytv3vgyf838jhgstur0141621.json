Not feeling secure that I had chosen my components correctly, I called to place my order with a real person, and that turned out to be the *amazing* Adam. He knew exactly what I wanted and gave me excellent advice... he even counselled me on weight of camera plus lens, and asked if I would be able to lift it easily enough to shoot with it? That's awesome service that shows a lot of care for the customer - I'll be back again and again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:28:29.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

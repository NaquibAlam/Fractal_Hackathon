One of the chairs arrived damaged and the accessory was missing. I called but was told it would probably be the following week before I received. Response as it was the weekend. I immediately received a call from John who assisted me with my issues. I emailed John again this week because one of the lights in the cup holder stopped working. He immediately ordered me another one and is scheduling a tech to come help me. Great service! The chairs are great too!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:15:53.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

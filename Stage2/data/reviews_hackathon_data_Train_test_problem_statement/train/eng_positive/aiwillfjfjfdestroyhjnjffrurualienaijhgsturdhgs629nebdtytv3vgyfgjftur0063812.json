We were a little unsure to book on line so gave them a call. The staff member on the phone was soooo helpful. The next day we went to the office to collect the car, and staff at the office were also informative and super helpful. The car was making and we had no issues at all. When we dropped off the car at the airport, staff there were lovely also.

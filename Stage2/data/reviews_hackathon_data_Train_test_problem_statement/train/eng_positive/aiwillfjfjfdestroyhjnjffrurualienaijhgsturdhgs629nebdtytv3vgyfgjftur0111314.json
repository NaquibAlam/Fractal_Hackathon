My sales person Stephanie was awesome. She was a lot of help and loved working with her. Would ask for her again. My BR furniture was delivered on the day and time they said it would be. The quality of the furniture is great. I love the fact they keep you updated with the time through out your time window. I special ordered a couch and had tons of fabric options. Can't wait to see it when it gets here. Overall I would highly recommend Home Zone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:43:15.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

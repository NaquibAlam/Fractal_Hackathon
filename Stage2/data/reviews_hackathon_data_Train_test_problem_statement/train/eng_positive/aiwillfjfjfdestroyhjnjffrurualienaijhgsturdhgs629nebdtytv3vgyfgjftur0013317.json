We recently bought a house in a\nrural-ish area. We experienced solid 2 bars (~-105-110db) outside the\nhouse and sketchy 1-2 bars inside before installing. After installation\nwe now get solid 4 bars (~-75-90db) inside the house! Outstanding!!!\nI installed the yagi directional antenna inside the attic at the peak of\nthe roof pointing out a wood vent towards the nearest tower and located the 'inside' antenna about 40 feet horizontal, 6 feet vertical away pointing slightly down towards living area and bedrooms. Directly in the line of this antenna we now see 4-5 bars and even at the most distant corner of the house get 3-4 bars. Woooohoooo!\nThis was a bit expensive but works as advertised and as it'll be used\ndaily will be worth the investment. I could probably get solid 5 bars\nall the time if I put the yagi on an antenna pole 10-20 feet higher than\nthe roof (lots of tall pine trees between us and the nearest tower) as\nwell as putting the inside antenna inside but the current configuration\nworks great and it saved me from fiddling with a mast on the roof and\nfrom fishing wire down through the ceiling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:21:07.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The customer service and absolutely worth the trust to order from this company, as they will promptly give you options of refunding or keep waiting if it has been longer than expected. Banggood really care for their clients and can tell they are striving to be the best as they can be reached at anytime if have any concerns or questions. I am a true buyer ordered4 different items all the more pricey items came through no issues, have 2 small items like: stickers and license plate trim cover still waiting on, for the deal they offer and if have time to wait it good place to order from. Everything else been perfect. Thanks,\nMike\nCanada", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T17:58:43.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

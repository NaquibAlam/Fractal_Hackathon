I've never needed to go anywhere else since.\nFor some years he sponsored my old club, London Branch BS-AC, with annual donations of kit in return for us sending customers his way. A wonderful man and much missed.\nAfter all these years, just been there again today to replace my worn out 30-year-old BCD before heading off to the Maldives (again...). An astonishing range of kit, VERY keen prices and superlative service as always. The current owner and staff do Mike's memory very proud...\nMatthew Jarrett", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:22:45.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

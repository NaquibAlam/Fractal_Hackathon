The next morning (today) I already see a noticeable difference.\nThe tear trough stress impressions lightened a little, aren't as long or deep anymore. My complexion is a bit more one-tone and even though as the nurses notified me I would have rough skin, it's still smoother. Not to mention, my pores have gotten SO MUCH smaller!! Or less noticeable without having to use makeup?\nAnd this is just from the first treatment. I can't wait to see what the finish product will be after the next 2!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:15:53.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

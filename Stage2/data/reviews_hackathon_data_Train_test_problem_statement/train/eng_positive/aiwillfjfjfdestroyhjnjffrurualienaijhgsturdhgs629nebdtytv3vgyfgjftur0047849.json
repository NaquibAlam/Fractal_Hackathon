I accidentally plugged the 19v power supply for my MONITOR into my HARD DRIVE DOCK the other night, that My 1TB and 2TB HDDS were in... They would not spin up and they tripped the power supply for the dock if I tried to power them up...\nAfter searching high and low I stumbled across Outsource Data Recovery, which has an awesome service that suited my situation perfectly!\nThey offer a $60 PCB repair, which is all my poor fried HDDs needed!\nThey sent me a shipping label, I shipped them the drives and a short time later they told me they had repaired them BOTH! I promptly paid for their service and return shipping, got my drives back, plugged them into the new replacement dock and EVERYTHING IS THERE AND WORK EXACTLY AS BEFORE!!!!\nI CANNOT THANK OUTSOURCE DATA RECOVERY ENOUGH!\nYOU GUYS ARE AMAZING!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:57:13.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

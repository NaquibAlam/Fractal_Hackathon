Child seats free and fitted. 7 year old car, seen a few miles and cosmetic scrapes, but was a very good motor. Couldn't fault it for the price, and you don't standout as a tourist. Bit of an effort to return the car out of hours at Wellington, but it got sorted in a fairly relaxed way (the reason I didn't give 5 star). Have used before, will use again, recommend to anyone (unless you like shiny motors).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T08:07:11.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

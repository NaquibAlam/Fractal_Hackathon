I've searched and searched and found plenty of what appear to be better deals that is until you read the small print. Exorbitant fuel prices, insurance excesses and roadside assitance charges for instance soon bang the price up. It's all up front with Malagacar. Last year I was given a virtually brand new Seat Ibiza which was a delight. I have been more than happy with all of the previous vehicles I have been given too. One time I did have to buy a litre of oil, just to top the engine up after a particularly long motorway drive. (As a professional driver I do check unfamiliar vehicles thoroughly for my own peace of mind). I was reimbursed for the cost of the oil without hassle or question. At busy periods there can be a bit of a queue for the minibus to pick you up from the airport. However when returning the vehicle on the past three occasions a driver has jumped in the car and taken us directly to the airport. This is brilliant and well worth keeping a few Euros handy for a tip for the driver. I don't bother checking around anymore I just go straight to Malagacar :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T13:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:23:27.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

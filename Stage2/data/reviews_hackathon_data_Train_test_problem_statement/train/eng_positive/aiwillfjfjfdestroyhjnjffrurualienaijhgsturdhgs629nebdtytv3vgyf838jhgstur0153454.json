Vacatia made it easy to set up my vacation and my family loved it. We had a full kitchen to cook our meals in with a screened balcony for the family to eat on. We really loved the heated pool and jacuzzi. I will definitely use Vacatia in the future and recommend them to others. Thank you, Vacatia!\nMelinda P from Homestead, FL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T10:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:05:10.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I purchased my tickets 5 months prior to event date, purchased September 2016 to be exact. The confirmation page noted that tickets would be available by January 2017, and I did not receive it by the date they listed. I waited about another 2 weeks (1.5 weeks out until event date). I finally sent a follow up email and asked when I should expect to receive my e-tickets. It was only once I sent a follow up did my tickets come into my inbox immediately. Response rate was excellent and I am happy that they resolved my issue immediately. Just a minor discomfort with the waiting especially since I was already technically waiting for the last 5 months. Didn't enjoy extending my anxiety for another 2 weeks, and didn't like that I needed to follow up. Otherwise, TicketCity was a good experience, I've had no other issues and any issues had were handled immediately.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T05:45:08.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I took chance with this company after reading the reviews. I desperately needed some nutritious, delicious, and affordable meals for my Mom. WOW!!! You guys exceeded my expectations tremendously!\nFirst, let me say that the packaging was fantastic! It was obvious that great care was taken with each item. Thank you! Secondly, the food looked delicious! I couldn't wait to heat up the chicken pot pie and broccoli meal for Mom's lunch. I was hoping it tasted as good as it looked. Yes, it tasted just as good as it looked! The crust, oh-h-h the crust on top of the pot pie must have been made in Heaven because it was truly Devine; light, flaky and just downright DELICIOUS! Mom use to be one hell of a cook and I was hoping it would meet her approval. Well, let me just say, she ate it ALL, and couldn't believe I had found a company that actually prepared REAL food that was delicious too! She was impressed! Thank you! Dinner time she wanted to try the dry rub baby back ribs, cabbage, and sweet potatoes. Another hit! The ribs were on P-O-I-N-T, s-o-o-o tender and\ns-o-o-o tasty. Mom again devoured the entire meal. The cabbage and sweet potatoes were equally delicious! She also raved about the raspberry swirl cheesecake! Everything was on POINT! Fantastic job! Now, for the really GOOD News: all of her apartment neighbors want to order from you. They were equally impressed and I provided your contact info so they can enjoy the delicious food. I will definitely be ordering again and again for my Mom. It is obvious you guys take pride in your cooking because we tasted LOVE in every bite! Thank you again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:48:28.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

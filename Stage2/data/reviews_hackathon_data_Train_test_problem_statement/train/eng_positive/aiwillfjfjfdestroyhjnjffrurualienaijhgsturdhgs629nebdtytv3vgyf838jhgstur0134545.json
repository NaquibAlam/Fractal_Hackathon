(Dayville CT) Their prices and service have been outstanding. We have been saving a lot of money compared to where we used to go. There can be a short wait if they happen to have a rush going on. But it is well worth it. Calling ahead can usually help to avoid that. Their little waiting room is comfortable with a TV, reading material and free coffee. I am pleased to be able to write a positive review for the new member of our community. Kevin and the rest of the staff have quickly earned my families business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:59:28.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

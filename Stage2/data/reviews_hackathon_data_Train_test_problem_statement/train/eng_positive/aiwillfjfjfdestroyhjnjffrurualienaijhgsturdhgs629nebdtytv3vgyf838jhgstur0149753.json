You're going receive a handsome (and FREE) package that will put all competitors to shame. Both in selection and presentation. The artwork and proof process was incredibly quick and accommodating. We asked for so many different changes and versions, I was certain they were going to get sick of us and stop responding haha. Mike D. was very helpful and understanding though and once we approved our design, we had the drives in our hands within the week! Very happy with the results and will definitely be coming back for more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:44:28.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

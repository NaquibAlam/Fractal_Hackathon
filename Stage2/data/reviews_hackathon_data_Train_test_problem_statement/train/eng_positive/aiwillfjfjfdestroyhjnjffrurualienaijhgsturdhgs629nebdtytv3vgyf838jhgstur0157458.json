Looking at hotels and packages has always been my weak point and using other sites like Expedia, Kayak was just too complicated and way too much stress on me.\nAs I look around the web, I found this great new website called Vacatia and fell in love with it right when I entered the site. I was so surprised with the selections and descriptions they have provided, I fell in love with Vacatia right away. Without hesitation I want to book my rental but right away, I found out they have a live chat function with a Vacatia agent.\nI was taken care of by Guest Care Agent Dan and I booked my trip to Tahoe at the Marriott Timber Lounge. I would recommend Vacatia to anyone and please ask for Dan for his service. He optimistic attitude and his professionalism is what is missing from the current Vacation Rental Industry.

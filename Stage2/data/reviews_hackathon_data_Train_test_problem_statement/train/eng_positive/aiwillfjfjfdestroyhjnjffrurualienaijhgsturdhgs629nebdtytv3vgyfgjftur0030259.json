I have a website for each, one for my book (Out of Uniform: Your Guide to a Successful Military to Civilian Career Transition & Tom Wolfe, Career Coach). Prior to moving my hosting to WebStarts I had constant issues with the two companies that were hosting my sites. I am not tech-savy, so I need help. I also need to simply make a request, get a response, and know that all is well. That is EXACTLY what Steve and his team at WebStarts did (and do) for me. They redesigned my sites, freshened them up, saved me money, made them more user-friendly--all-in-all, a big improvement. I have requested a few changes since the initial launch and they responded immediately and gave me exactly what I asked for. I give them an A+ for value, professionalism, response time, and customer support.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:39:22.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

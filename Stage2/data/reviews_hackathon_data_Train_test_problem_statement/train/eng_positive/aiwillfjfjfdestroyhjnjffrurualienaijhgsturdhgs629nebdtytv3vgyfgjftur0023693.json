I read the reviews & decided to try. When I called customer service to ask questions before making purchase she was very polite & helpful. I ordered the Master Cardiology Stethoscope w/ engraving & tuning forks for school on 1/31 by 10 am (selected $12.99 & rush $1.99) & they were at my door the next day 2/1 by 2 pm as I needed them by Sat.(look at shipping times map its color coded I live in central NY so that may make a difference). The order was correct & packed well. I am impressed with how fast they were as some orders would take a week for the same price S&H. I was also able to select a box at checkout for free App (w/stethoscope) being I am a student.\nI would definitely order again even if their products cost a few dollars more just because of the shipping & customer service. They do not price match, but you can email the company to ask - I know others don't as well. OH if you try to use the online chat you will get someone from the UK so call the number at the top of the website :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T22:40:05.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

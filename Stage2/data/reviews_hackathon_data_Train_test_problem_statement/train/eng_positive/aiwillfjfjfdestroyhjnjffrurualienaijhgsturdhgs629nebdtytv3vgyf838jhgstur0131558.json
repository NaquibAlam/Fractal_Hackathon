They had to be right as they aren't cheap. My pillows arrived super quick. They were beautifully boxed and wrapped, each individual pillow case. The quality of the silk is amazing. I am very impressed! I will buy again from lilysilk without hesitation. Forgot to mention in my review, my skin and hair both feel softer too and i am having such a lovely nights sleep with the softness of the pillows on my face. Honestly, I wish I had discovered them years ago! I might have prevented some of the lines on my face I have accrued over the years, whilst sleeping on any old bedding. All I have to say now, is that I cant wait for bedtime tonight!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:38:37.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

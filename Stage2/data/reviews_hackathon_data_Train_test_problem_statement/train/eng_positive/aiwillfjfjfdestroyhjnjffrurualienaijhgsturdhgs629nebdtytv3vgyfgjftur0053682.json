The two trips were quite different in hotel levels but we had excellent guides and felt safe and well-informed throughout both tours. We learned a lot about the different cultures, way of thinking, history, variety of religions and we really got to know the locals. Everyone was friendly and helpful and our guides ensured we had a wide variety of food experiences, including many fruits new to us such as jack fruits, durian, mangostein and even ate meals from the food truck foods which were cheap, tasty and surprisingly safe. However, we drank carefully-chosen bottled water (reverse osmosis, etc.) and did not get sick which had been a concern, given our advanced ages. We particularly enjoyed the beautiful orchid gardens in Singapore, the beautiful temples, Hindu caves, mosques, palaces and shrines, and a visit to a museum which was really a house of a wealthy Chinese family for many years in Malaysia, the Cameron Highlands and a tea plantation with the beautiful terracing, a walk through a mangrove forest and the charcoal making factory. In Bangkok our highlights were an exciting private long-boat trip through the canals to the floating markets, a dinner cruise, visiting the Grand Palace and many rich Bhuddist Temples. In Cambodia we had an amazing visit to Angkor Wat and several of its many ruins from the 9th to the 13th centuries. Even returned for a sunrise visit for photos the next day. Our homestay with a local family in the country was a very interesting insight into the ways of the average Cambodian and their neighbours. Later we tried a fried cricket but chose to only look at the deep fried tarantulas and worms. The visit to the Tuol Sleng Museum and the Killing Fields of the Khmer Rouge era was a grim reminder of what can go wrong in societies if power is misused. Then in Ho Chi Minh City we enjoyed meeting university students who were practicing their English in the park near our hotel. Everyone was so polite and gracious and we felt quite comfortable wandering about. We enjoyed numerous tuk tuk rides while in Cambodia, probably the safest and most exciting way to get around cheaply and fast, in a land where traffic is very heavy and unpredictable. We would recommend this trip to anyone wishing to get out and meet the people of these counties and learn about their way of life. Our first tour was with Asian World Enterprises followed by Intrepid Tours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:59:36.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Strips are high quality and well made and are brighter then others. The only problem I had was with the shipping. Solid Apollo shipped with FedEx and had a signature required and someone had to be there for delivery. I was not informed of this so the package was not delivered as I was not home at the time of delivery (stepped out for 45 min. and that is when FedEx came). If your going to require A signature please state that in RED letters when checking out so people know.\nThank You.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T09:41:09.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

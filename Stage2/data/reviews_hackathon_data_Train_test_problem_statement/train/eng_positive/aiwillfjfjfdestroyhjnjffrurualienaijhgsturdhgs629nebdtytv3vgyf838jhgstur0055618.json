The surgery went so smoothly and so quickly I was in and out in no time! The staff from the receptionist to the surgeon were so polite, clinical and professional. I am so pleased and happy with the results. It is like I have been looking through a couple of really dirty windows for over 60 years and a window cleaner has jumped into my eyes and gave them a goods clean. Everything now is so bright and colours so vibrant my mind now is looking to see what it has missed all these years! Thank you Optical Express. Sophie who first spoke to me and tested my eyes needs to be named for being so nice she is a lovely person!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:25:54.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

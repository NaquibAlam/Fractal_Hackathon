I'm very please with the help I received customizing the self-book options. We now use it for time off requests, and requests to fill open shifts and it is so much easier to keep track of because it is all right there on the date, I don't have to search through all my emails to see who has made what requests. The system can send email notifications about requests to the administrator and the requester. I like the flexibility of it. There is an app so everyone can access the schedule on the go. Scheduling has become a whole lot easier and less time consuming. I've looked at other scheduling software that was much more expensive and didn't suit my purposes. I'm very pleased with keep&share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:50:49.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

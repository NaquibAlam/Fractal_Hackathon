It's the perfect balance of stability without compromise. Also, it's a fabulous way to love and care for pets that aren't mine, as having a pet of my own at the moment isn't feasible. It's a win-win situation where the homeowner is at peace whilst on holiday, and myself as a housesitter have some creature comforts before moving on to my next destination. The pleasure I get from caring for animals has no price either. I am constantly recommending this site to more and more travellers I meet along the way. One of the best ways of maintaining a nomadic lifestyle whilst still having the opportunity to live like a local! Thank you TrustedHousesitters!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:49:03.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Be it in the marketing of the property, which mostly is only vacant for a week or the management of the property. She always ensures that exiting tenants meet their obligations and that the property is in good shape for the next tenants. Any issues that the tenants raise are promptly dealt with and I am also always kept informed. I note that quite often when I have sent a query to her on a Friday or over the weekend that she reads it almost immediately on the weekend! She has a friendly but firm disposition towards my tenants, so that they feel like they are at home and being heard, but she is no pushover when it comes to unreasonable demands. She provides feedback to any of my requests faster than I can read them or is straight on the phone, is very friendly and very professional.\nIn short she is by far the best property manager I have ever had, and I have had quite a number given that I started buying investment properties in 2000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:17:40.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

However, I am buying ribbons for 12 regional shows (24 class + each)and a zone show (44 classes + other awards) and although they were beautiful, the cost to my budget was outrageous. Hodges is an IEA sponsor, but the zones receive no special discounts - the February 10% off was appreciated, but really a drop in the bucket! Also, it seems unfair to charge Next Day air based on the gross expenditure instead of weight and then offer to send early if they are done. Please consider some future discounts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T08:36:44.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

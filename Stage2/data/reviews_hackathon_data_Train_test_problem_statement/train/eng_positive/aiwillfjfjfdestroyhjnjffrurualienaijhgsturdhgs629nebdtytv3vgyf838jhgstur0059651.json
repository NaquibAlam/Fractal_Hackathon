In a nut shell I had my ordered canceled an left a bad review for them. Within mins I get a call personally from the VP himself not only apologizing but then went above and beyond to make things right!! What I liked best was the one on one from the man himself and he letting me know if there was anything in the future I could contact him if something went wrong. Now that is customer service!! What business does that now a days? That right there shows how they do business and how loyal to there customers they are! I still amazed what just happen but in the end I still get to enjoy my game and I'm am very please with the outcome and the way things turned out! I would gladly do business with Gamecheap again! Nothing is ever perfect but at least they strive literally for the best! The problem was addressed and the way this issue was handled was very professional!

I work with 98 different police departments and 105 fire departments in my zone. Your T Tex series is the best i have found out there, alot of officer's have asked who makes that light it bright and light weight and i tell them voidhawk and highly recommend them. I do know you are all working hard and have alot of phone call. I would only say one thing, if you say you will get back with someone in 24 hrs, then you need to get back to that person. I have called a few times and no one ever called me back. Although that dose not change my mind about your lights or change my mind on buying them. Love the products. Customer service is the most important part of any company no matter what is going on. I still highy recommend you all to people i meet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T09:46:32.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

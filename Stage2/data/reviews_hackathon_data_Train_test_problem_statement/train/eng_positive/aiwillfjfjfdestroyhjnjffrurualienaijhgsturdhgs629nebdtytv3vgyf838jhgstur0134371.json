What's NOT to love??? Most books start at the $3.75 range and shipping is free for orders more than $10. The books I have received are in excellent condition for the most part. I have ordered some older books that were \"loved\" and had some underlining. I am not troubled by that. If they don't have what you want, keep checking. I have saved a small fortune by using this site. And, do yourself a favor and download the app. Most of my books have arrived within a week--faster than some orders that I have placed with Barnes and Noble's marketplace. To top it off, you can earn a coupon for $5 when you achieve the $50 sales level.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:49:49.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

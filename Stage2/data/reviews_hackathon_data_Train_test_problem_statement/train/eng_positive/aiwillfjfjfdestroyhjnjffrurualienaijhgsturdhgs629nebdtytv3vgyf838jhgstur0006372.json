I had the pleasure of working with Brad who was always very fast to reply to emails and very knowledgeable as well as efficient in getting me answers. We were in a time crunch and he worked hard to make sure that we received our order of USBs before the date we gave him. The design he helped us create was beautiful, sleek and modern and exactly what we were looking for. I was very pleased that the mock-up designs he created for us were free of charge. The USBs look amazing and I am very pleased with every encounter I had with Brad and the rest of the team. We look forward to partnering with this company again in the future and I would highly recommend them to all, from small business to large corporation. Thanks Brad and the Custom USB team for going above and beyond and delivering more than we ever expected!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T13:41:50.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

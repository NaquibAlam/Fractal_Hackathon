The vehicle was clean and operated well. We had a great time traveling in it around the Mojave Desert. I was concerned about being cool at night (our trip was in March) but Jucy provided plenty of warm blankets. Pick up and drop off was quick and efficient and was only minutes from the airport. Finally, the customer service was above and beyond.\nWe had some technology issues with booking and there is some information that is not correctly listed on the website, so I would call and verify times, etc. However, the customer service from Nicole B and Keisheila L made up for it. Nicole was quick and helpful to fix our booking error. Keisheila went above and beyond to help us out when our flight was canceled- she even provided her home number in case we needed additional help! We had a great escape into the desert and we are already discussing future trips.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:47:55.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

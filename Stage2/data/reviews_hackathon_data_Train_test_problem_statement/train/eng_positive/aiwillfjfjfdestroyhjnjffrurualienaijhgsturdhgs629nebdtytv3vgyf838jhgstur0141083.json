Due to the wide array of gift card options, their \"marketplace\" of finding the right gift card, for the right price and for the best discount plus a possible reward when you choose a preferred partner, can not be beat. The site is easy to use, as long as you can spell in English and understand Arabic numbers. The service is the best.\nThe rewards program is somewhat limited but, hey, I can always use an extra $5. In 2016, I earned 3 or 4 rewards. Of course, you need to spend money to make money, so I can honestly say, only use Gift Card Granny before going to any gift card exchange directly.\nMy only issue that I had was when I sent a note about the poor service I received from one of the gift card resellers, I did not expect them to intercede on my behalf, but thought they would have at least responded with some words of comfort or something. If you offer to be contacted, you need to respond in some manner, so sayeth someone who has directed many different customer call centers", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:32:47.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

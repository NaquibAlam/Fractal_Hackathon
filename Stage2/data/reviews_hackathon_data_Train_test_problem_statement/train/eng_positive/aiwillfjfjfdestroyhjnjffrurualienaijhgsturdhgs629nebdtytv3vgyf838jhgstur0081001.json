Sale price was so good I almost got one fixture free with the amount saved on the quantity I purchased. Any time you buy used there is a level of fear for the quality of the gear. The lights I purchased had between 3,000 and 4,000 hours on them but didn't have any scratches. If I had not known better I would have thought they came from an install and not a rental house. The packing for shipping was extremely secure and well done. One fixture out of the lot had a pan issue upon arrival. I sent an email to my sales representative and quickly she had me in touch with the closest office to my location to set up a repair. Shipped it off and in less than a week I had the fixture back in perfect working condition. Usedlighting.com takes great care of it's customers and knows how to create return customers. This was not my first purchase with them and for sure it will not be my last.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T12:10:49.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Upon booking my flight I found that it was a very easy site to use and they directed me to options that might be a better fit for me. I rarely fly, and the reason for this trip is that I just lost my dad in a head-on collision. I needed to fly back East to take care of his Arrangements. With all that is going through my mind right now, it was refreshing to be able to book the flight and rental car so effortlessly. I would definitely recommend Flighthub", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T02:51:50.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

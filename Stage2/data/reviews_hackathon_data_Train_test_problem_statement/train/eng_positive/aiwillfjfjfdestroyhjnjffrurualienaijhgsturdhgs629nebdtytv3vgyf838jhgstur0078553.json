It's nice to deal with a large company where common sense prevails. When there are issues (I'm a seller more than buyer) the customer service are quick to rationally resolve issues. There's a large support forum from other users with experience and it's usually the case that questions are easy to find if already answered.\nThe rates are much much better than elsewhere and represent a fair commission structure.\nThere are a few minor improvements I'd like to see, but I'm happy to report they do take comments on board,it is an evolving platform with real potential.\nI'll certainly be a long term user. The main thing that will make it better is getting other people involved. It would massively benefit from more sellers and buyers. I see no reason why this won't come in time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T04:34:54.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

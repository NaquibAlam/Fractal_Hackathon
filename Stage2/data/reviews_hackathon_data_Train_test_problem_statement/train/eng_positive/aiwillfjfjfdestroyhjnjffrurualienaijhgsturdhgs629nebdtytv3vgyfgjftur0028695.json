I bought 5 items and didn't like the first one I opened. I was told that I could return all of them for a refund, provided that the opened item was resalable.\nI was told that the opened item was not resalable, so I got a refund for the unopened 4. What bothers me is that Totally Wicked kept that item. Upon thinking about it, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. With this policy, I was deprived of the use of the item which I paid for. I could have tried to salvage that one item for a friend, but no -- I am out over $40 instead!\nNot a good feeling!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T11:12:57.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

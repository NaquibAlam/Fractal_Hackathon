Some of the bottles were half empty! Biovea sent me a faulty product. I think they knew it was faulty and still decided to send it to me.\nUpdate: Before posting this review I waited to give it a chance for biovea to correct the mistake and they did. They took full responsibility and the customer service was same or better than googles customer service. I would re order again since I have the guarantee that biovea will do whats right and stand by the customer side. I do honestly hope they do a better quality control next time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:21:37.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

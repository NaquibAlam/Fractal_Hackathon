We would like to thank Jamie for all his help, sense of humor and expertise in planning these trips. Our trip home was delayed because of sickness and we really appreciated all the help Jamie gave us in reorganizing and resheduling our return flight. It was done quickly and efficiently. This was our second trip to India with the help of Jamie. It's a great tour, highlights were the houseboat trip in Alleppey and hiking to the Tigers Nest in Bhutan. Both tours offered a good cross section of things to do and also time to enjoy the people of both countries. We would have no hesitation to recommend GOWAY travel and Jamie Loyd for any travel plans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:02:39.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Although my order got messed up and I was only shipped half of my order, I spoke to someone in customer service and they over-nighted the rest of my order at no extra cost. Even though my order was messed up, they instantly rectified the situation and now have a lifetime customer. I will be ordering plenty more from this website. Not only am I happy with the service, the shipping & packaging quality, but the products are very good and good quality items.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:17:07.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

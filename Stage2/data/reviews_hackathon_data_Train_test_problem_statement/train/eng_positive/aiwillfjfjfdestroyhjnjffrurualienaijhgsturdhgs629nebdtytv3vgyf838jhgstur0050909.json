I met Cory thru a family member. I got an appointment right away. No if no buts she had informed briefly the things I needed to bring with me.\nFirst time to meet her at her office she greets you with a smile, and 'Hi there, ill be with you in a sec.' frankly I didn't care if I was to wait for hours. When I got to sit in her office I was a mess and nervous, without her knowing that she made me feel at ease. She told me to be fully honest even it was hard. She had the best interest at heart. She only wanted to help me get a little help of boost up to start a fresh, specially I was pregnant at time with my first child, that I waited to happen for 9years. I gave the requirements, which I may add was simple. Then she said okay I will process this and meet you soon. One month later, here comes my signing my proposal my fresh start. But the moment I left her office on my first meeting I was not a satisfied customer, I WAS GREATFUL, HAPPY, RELIEVED, REBORN lol... no seriously...\nThen I had to go to there main office for the signing. Everyone was so pleasant. Finally met the laddies who answers the phone so ever so nice all the time.\nthen the rest is history....\nTo Cory, THANK YOU FOR BEING YOU!!! You are best at what you do, I'm sure you'll help a lot more people. Thank you for being kind, sensitive and caring. Thank you for listening...\nTo all who needs help for any financial needs. You need to be honest and accept all advice DAVID Sklar assc. Follow what they tell you... trust me its good a goodnight sleep everyday after that....", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T19:02:24.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

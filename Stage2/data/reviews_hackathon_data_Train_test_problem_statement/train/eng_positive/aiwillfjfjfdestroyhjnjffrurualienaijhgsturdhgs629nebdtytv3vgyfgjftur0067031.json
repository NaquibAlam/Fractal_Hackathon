I never feel that I am giving up the look to go to work daily in comfort. This is a dress up or dress down style for the workplace and I love the feel of the fabric and it supports so well. Other fabrics from local retailers never keep their shape and I tug and pull at the outfits when I sit, stand, run, or engage in various positions in my own workout routines. With Fabletics, there is never an adjustment or any discomfort or self-consciousness when working out or at work. Way to go, Kate. I love your line!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T23:50:25.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

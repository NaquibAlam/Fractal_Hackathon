Recently I placed a 2-day order with a competitor that got turned over to another vendor which required another two days and in this case the part was for myself ,but a customer would have been veryou upset if I promised them 2 days. So I would recommend Parts Town to anyone from my experience. Thank you very much for all the hard work you do at Partstown!\nMFD", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T14:45:30.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

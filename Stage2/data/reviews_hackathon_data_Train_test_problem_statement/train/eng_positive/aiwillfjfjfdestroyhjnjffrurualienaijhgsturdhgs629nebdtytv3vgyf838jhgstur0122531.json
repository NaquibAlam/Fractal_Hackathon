Everyone I spoke to was so pleasant and helpful each time, from the secretary to the lawyer that was assigned to my case. I was so upset when I first called but he put my mind to ease and made this process so much less difficult. My ex husband even made me make revisions to the paperwork and I was stressed because I thought this would be an issue and occur more fees but it was no problem at all. They handled every aspect of this case in a timely manner. I would recommend this firm to anyone going through a divorce contested or uncontested. Thank you guys so much!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:07:02.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

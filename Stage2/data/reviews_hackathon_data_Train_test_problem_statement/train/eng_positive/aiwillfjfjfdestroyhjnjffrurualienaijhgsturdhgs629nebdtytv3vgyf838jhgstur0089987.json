I kept blowing & blowing & it locked me out a couple times & it was a hassle. I finally got it started & made it home then gave the company a call. I was then put on the line with Bobbie Hennig. She was by far the most amazing customer service rep I have ever had in my life, not just with this specific company. She expressed great concern & slowly walked me through every step she asked me to do. She was paitent, kind, & understanding. I would highly reccomend her to anyone! She also had a great sense of humor which helped in me calm down in my aggregated state of mind. I couldn't help but take the time out of my busy day to write her this review. Bobbie is a great aspect to the company & should most definitely be recognized for it!\n-Jamie B.\n-From Maryland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T18:55:33.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We were travelling to Germany and needed the winter tyres.\nI selected a set of all weather tyres for our 4x4, not wanting to have to keep changing between summer and winter tyres.\nWhen the customer service team called up to book my fitting I double checked with them that the tyres would be within the German laws. Not knowing the answer, the agent sought out help from additional sources, including warehouse, fitters and agents. She then called me back within 20mins to assure me that they were legal in Germany as winter tyres. This alone warranted an excellent review as she went above and beyond the expected service (I had spoken to a number of VERY unhelpful companies by this point and got nowhere).\nMy wife was at home when the fitter came to put the tyres on the car and she said that he could not be more helpful. He was very punctual - arriving 10mins before the fitting time to set up all the tools etc he needed and he had the job done in under half an hour.\nWe are delighted with the service received by Tyres on the Drive and I have recommended them to at least three people in the last 3 weeks! I will definitely be using this company again when I need new tyres!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:57:18.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Had resigned myself to having to finish it on my next days off, as I was due to return to work in two days time.\nHowever, I ordered a can of Holts exact match aerosol from Mick's Garage on-line at 5pm and was amazed to receive an e-mail the next day at 7am telling me the item was already at my local Royal Mail sorting office. It was delivered at 10am, so I was able to finish the job that day after all.\nExcellent service and amazingly quick delivery. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:07:36.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

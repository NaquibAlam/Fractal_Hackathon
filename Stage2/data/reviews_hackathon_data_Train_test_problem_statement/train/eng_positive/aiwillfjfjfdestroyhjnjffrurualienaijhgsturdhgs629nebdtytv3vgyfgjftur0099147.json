That was not the case with Sam Willis.\nFrom the very beginning he was honest and forthright about what he would do and made it very clear, in explicit terms in writing, what I could expect from him.\nThen, he over-delivered! He went above and beyond what our agreement was and produced an e-commerce site that exceeded all expectations.\nThis is a guy who knows the Shopify platform and system to the highest degree...the best themes, the best apps and the best procedures to choose and promote the best products in the best niches. That's a lot of 'bests' and that comes as a result of his hard work and dedication to learn and understand all there is to know about this unique method of e-commerce.\nAt the time he hands over the store, you will have a solid foundation on which to expand your own talents and make your business a success.\nThank you Sam for everything you did. I truly appreciate it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T14:51:10.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was extremely hesitant on buying anything online since you never know how it will fit. We did her measurements according the website and it all said small except for her hip/butt area that said \"large\" (she isn't big hipped but this white girl has a shapely booty). We went with our gut and ordered all small. I am glad we did. Everything fit amazingly. Only thing is, be prepared for the length to be extremely long. That is not a bad thing since height is so different for everyone. We brought it to a seamstress and got it shortened (did not alter anything else). It all still looked amazing. I'm not sure if I can load a picture of her in the dress, but if not, don't hesitate. Everything is beautiful made. The shipping was on time. It actually came earlier then said. We paid for 2 day shipping since we were getting closer and I was afraid of it not fitting. The dress shaped her body beautifully. I would buy from here again!! Thank you!

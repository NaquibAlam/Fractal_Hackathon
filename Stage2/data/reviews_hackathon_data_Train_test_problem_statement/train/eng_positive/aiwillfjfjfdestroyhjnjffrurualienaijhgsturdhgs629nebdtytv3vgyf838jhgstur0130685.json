They have worked together with us instructing us on what will be the best choice for us and our business. Great service, great knowledge, but what stood out for me the most is the caring and attentiveness behind everything they do. Marlene Hudson, one of the paralegals was amazing and so pleasant to speak to, even on the emails I she made me feel like I've known her for years. I definitely feel I got my money's worth, every penny and more with the incredible service that I have received thought this process. Thank NCH for your advice, your help and for getting things done so quickly and efficiently. Oh and Marlene you are a huge asset to the company, I hope they truly see that. God bless you guys for all you do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:48:20.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

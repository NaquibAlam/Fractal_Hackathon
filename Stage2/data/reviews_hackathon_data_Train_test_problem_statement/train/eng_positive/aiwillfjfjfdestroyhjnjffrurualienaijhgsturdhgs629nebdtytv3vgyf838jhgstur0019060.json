The laminates I ordered were backordered but they called me and did a good job of keeping me informed on the status of my purchase. Everything came superbly packed. I refrigerated the bees and built a house for the laminates. The laminates looks to be very nicely built and the bees were packed and wrapped in a cold pack. There prices seemed as good or better than any other stores I looked at. The cacoons seem very pricey once you see how small and few bees you actually get. I've not set the bees out yet so I can not vouch for the mortality rate. Overall though they seem like a solid company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T10:33:14.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

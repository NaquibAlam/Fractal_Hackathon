My usual travel agent was concerned with this but I had great comfort pursuing my connection with Rebecca. There was not a moment she or her company left me concerned. They actually superseded our expectations and more. The itinerary was thorough and contact info included. The site pics made you get excited to get there. Being greeted at the airport was just such a nice touch. Made it worry free. Any questions on our trip were immediately answered via email. The hotels booked were top notch. It was nice having planned excursions. The country is beautiful lush, friendly and we felt safe and very welcomed. I have no hesitation passing on my contact with Rebecca to their friends and family. I will also consider the use of her affiliate company when we consider going to Panama or maybe even Nicaragra .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:51:54.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

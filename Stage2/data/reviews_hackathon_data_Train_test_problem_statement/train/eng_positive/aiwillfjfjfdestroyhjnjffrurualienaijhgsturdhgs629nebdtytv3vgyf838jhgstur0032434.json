We had a trip planned for a month and needed our pets looked after. We didn't want to kennel them for that length of time. We looked into TrustedHousesitters and felt comfortable with the set up. We wrote an ad for our place and what we needed. Within a couple of hours we had 7/8 people interested. We communicated back and forth with different couples and settled on one couple that we really liked. We Skyped with them to sort of meet beforehand. We were comfortable with the knowledge that they had supplied a record check and had reviews from previous people who had them stay and look after their house and pets. All around, it was an excellent experience and we have already recommended this site to people we know with pets!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:28:01.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

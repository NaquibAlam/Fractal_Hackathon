Embarrassed, I contacted SSENSE right away and unfortunately the \"best\" that could be done was a $35 refund. This was due to the fact that I took too long to contact them... mind you it was the holiday season and I was traveling. I'm glad you did your best to address my problem and offer a solution to it, but as a sneaker connoisseur myself, Y3 sneakers should not tear so easily. ESPECIALLY, after being worn only for 4 hours inside an apartment.\nThank you,\nKristyne", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:15:22.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

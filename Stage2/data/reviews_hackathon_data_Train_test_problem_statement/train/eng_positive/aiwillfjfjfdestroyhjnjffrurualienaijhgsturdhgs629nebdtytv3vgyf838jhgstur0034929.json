Changes were made such as with packaging materials and dry ice contents and those issues have ceased to exit. Their wild fish and other products are absolutely the best! I just wish the standard delivery for non-perishables items could be quicker. I would (and do) recommend Vital Choice to others since I have used other fish companies and know that Vital Choice is the best for quality and great tasting wild and organic products, delivery and customer service. I order wild and fresh Copper River Salmons from another company during the summer and they are superb, but I wish Vital Choice carried \"Fresh and Wild\" during spring/summer because I think they would be even better! The frozen Copper Rivers do not capture the glorious taste of the real wild deals. Thanks for your service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T08:00:02.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

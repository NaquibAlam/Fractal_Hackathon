I got to a point where I knew I needed a professional to help me figure out a solution.\nI had spoken to a financial advisor who suggested a consumer proposal as my best option for dealing with my debt.\nI researched companies online and David Sklar & Associates had good reviews.\nI called and set up an appointment and brought all the documents they required for the consultation\nI met with Jackie and she was really lovely to deal with. She was not judgemental and gave me honest facts about what I could do and the impact it would have on my credit rating.\nShe offered me great advice and tips on how I can better manage my finances and how I can rebuild my credit.\nI was extremely satisfied with her service and my experience.\nI highly recommend anyone dealing with financial difficulties to give them a call.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:55:38.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

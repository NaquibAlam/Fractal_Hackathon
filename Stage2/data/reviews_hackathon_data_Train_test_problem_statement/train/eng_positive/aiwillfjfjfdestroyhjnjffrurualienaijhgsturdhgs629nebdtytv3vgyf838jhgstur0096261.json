They also show you 2 different prices and it is not specified that seat selection has an additional price until the very end. When I called to ask why I was seeing 2 different prices, they told me the fare had just increased and that it was in my best interest to book my ticket immediately over the phone so it wouldn't increase even more. They said the price I was seeing was no longer available and gave me a much higher one, but I refused to do it over the phone and went back to read everything. That's when I noticed the problem was the seat selection fee. They did not tell me that, but tried to use it to get me to pay more on the spot. I also ended up mistakenly selecting the travel insurance and was charged $74 more. The issue was quickly solved over the phone though and I got a refund in minutes. That part of the service was amazing and effective, but they definitely must make their invoices and additional service options clearer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:04:46.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

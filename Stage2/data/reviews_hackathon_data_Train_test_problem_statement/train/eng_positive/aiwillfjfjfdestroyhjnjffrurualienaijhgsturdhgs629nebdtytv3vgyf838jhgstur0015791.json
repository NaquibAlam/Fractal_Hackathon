We've had several leaks in the polybutylene pipes and even though the major ones happened before we found flologic those leaks lead us to Flologic. Had we not been home at the time of the leaks we would have had severe damage to our home. Now with flologic we feel more comfortable leaving the house knowing we will not come home to a real mess. We are planning on having the polybutylene piping replaced but are very happy we will have the flologic to protect us", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T12:33:27.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

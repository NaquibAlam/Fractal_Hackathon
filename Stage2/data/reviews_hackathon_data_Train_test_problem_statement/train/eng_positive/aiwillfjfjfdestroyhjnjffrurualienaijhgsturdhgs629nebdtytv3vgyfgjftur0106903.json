We deliver mostly to hospitals and nursing homes. One resident who received our product as a gift complained about the \"ugly\" bag on her walker. She needed it to help carry items. So we designed a walker bag that was \"pretty\" and brought it to the lady. It was a hit, and we made more bags, but we needed packaging & we needed it fast. We called Clear Bags, spoke to them on the phone, and, within 3 days, they sent us bags that fit perfectly. We have already reordered the same bags and plan to contact Clear Bags as we add other products to our line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T18:56:22.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The rental procedure was easy enough, we where offered an upgrade to a larger vehicle and took the option for a fee. I requested a GPS unit and the assistant advised we could use our phones to log into the onboard car screen with ease. This was not as easy as described especially when I was told there is a cable to do so. We just used our phones. On returning the vehicle there was no signage indicating the redspot designated zones, they only have poorly spray painted parking bays, a competitors assistant advised us where to look. Other than that drop off was quick and easy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T05:13:03.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

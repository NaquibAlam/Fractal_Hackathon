I'm working on my collection of Dean Koontz novels and Thriftbooks had plenty that I hadn't been able to find elsewhere. All of the books were in the condition they were described in, and I have no problem buying used books. The fact that I only had to spend $10 to get free shipping blew my mind. My books arrived in several different shipments, but the time it took to get them was worth not having to pay outrageous shipping prices. I will definitely be buying from them again in the future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:26:58.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

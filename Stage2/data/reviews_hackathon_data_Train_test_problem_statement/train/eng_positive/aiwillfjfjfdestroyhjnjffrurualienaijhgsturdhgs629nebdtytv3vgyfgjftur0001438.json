I love the prices and the quick shipping and the variety of books and the ease of use of the website.\nThe only thing I don't like, which I have voiced before...is the sticker on the spine of the book. On paperbacks and certain type of hardcovers removing the sticker also rips off part fo the spine. I don't like the way the sticker looks so I remove them and damage a lot of the covers that way. I'm requesting either a different adhesive that doesn't damage the book or an alternative to putting a sticker on the spine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:49:13.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

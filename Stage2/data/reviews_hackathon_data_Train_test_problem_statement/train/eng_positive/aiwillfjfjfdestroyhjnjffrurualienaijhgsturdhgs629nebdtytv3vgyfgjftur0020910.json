I have been teaching English online with this website for 5 months now (after teaching'for real' since 1984 !!!). ITALKI suits me and the students I teach really well - we both get a lot out of the experience and we have fun. You can book your lessons in advance, as many or as few as you want - you can even re-arrange the times after you have book if you have a problem.\nFor me ITALKI is the most convenient way to improve your Speaking and Listening skills, but some people use it for higher level exam preparation (I personally don't do this - but other teachers specialise in it).\nI strongly recommend ITALKI for Pre- Intermediate to Advanced students - your existing knowledge will allow you to benefit from the 'one on one' experience. Ideally you will have access to a desktop/ netbook/ laptop computer, but a tablet with good internet is okay.\nGood luck with your learning and I hope to see you on ITALKI soon - Neil ;-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:18:20.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

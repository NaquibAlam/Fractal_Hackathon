This is the first time I have ordered pre-cut mats and acrylic glazing. I'll admit that I was a bit apprehensive about whether the packing would be adequate for shipping to Alaska, but I needn't have worried. The packers at American Frame did an excellent job. I ordered 20 pre-cut mats, backing board, and acrylic glazing, and everything arrived in perfect condition. The accuracy of the cutting was excellent, and the order was also processed very quickly. Yay, American Frame!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:39:21.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

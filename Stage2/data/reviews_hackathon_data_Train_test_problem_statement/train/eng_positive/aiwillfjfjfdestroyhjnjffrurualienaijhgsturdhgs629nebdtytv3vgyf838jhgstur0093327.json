I've had to hard reset at least 15 to 20 times over the weekend and into today I believe. 4 and 5 resets and shoulder taps per test window. It's ridiculous. Out of all of these calls into smart start, Bobbie Hennig was the most helpful, professional and a joy to speak with. I've pretty much dreaded every other call, but she is why I'm giving you a good rating. If even 50% of the other customer support agents were like her, I'd have given you 5 Stars instead of 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T19:23:35.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

What a huge time saver trying to find restaurants in my area who deliver or cater. I order food monthly for work and this site has been such a blessing. It's also nice that you don't have to sign for the delivery and the website is very user friendly. The best thing is you can use it all across the US! I shared it with my co-workers across Virginia and they were thrilled. I only hope more restaurants/caterers sign up with ezCater as they would get my business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:39:10.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

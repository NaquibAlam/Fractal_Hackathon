He is far above our expectations as well as our neighbors. We had stopped going to the Billerica store over 2 years ago. Then about a year ago, I went out of necessity. Marc had waited on us. We now call ahead to make sure he takes care of us. He has brought a new found customer service that was clearly lacking. The other day, while waiting for my car I saw Marc juggling calls, in-store clients and shop employees asking questions, he handled these with ease and efficiency. I imagine that he is one of your top managers/ or staff. These days most people comment only on negatives. I felt compelled to send something positive.\nBeing an HR executive, I am sure the store has had a steady improvement in customer counts-- credit Marc! As sometimes it takes a year or more to gain trust back from any town.\nWithout further blubbering, Well Done!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:10:09.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

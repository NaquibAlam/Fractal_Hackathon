It was easy to find a drop off location and the kiosk was simple to use. I immediately received a conformation email that the kiosk had received my iPad. The email estimated the cost and the completion time. Later in the day I received a very professional phone call, from a person not an automated machine, telling me the iPad would be ready for pickup by 6:00 PM. I picked the iPad up without any issue and to my pleasant surprise, FoxPaw refunded me $10.00 for the repair (I think I had selected the wrong model of iPad when I dropped it off and my model was less expensive to repair than the model I had selected). It was a fast (less than 10 hours), professional, seamless transaction. Thank you FoxPaw. I highly recommend your service to everyone!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:30:16.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

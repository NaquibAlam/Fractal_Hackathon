The design, order & approval process was easy & with upgraded shipping I was guaranteed delivery with 2 days to spare before my event. Shirts shipped out and then got stuck in UPS land due to a warehouse fire. UPS had no information to provide on whether we'd receive the shirts by our event or if they were damaged and we'd never receive. I got a call back from the supervisor in customer service at Rush Order Tees after talking with UPS and having no luck - she truly went above and beyond for us by making all of our shirts again and shipping via another carrier so we would receive before our event the next day. The shirts arrived at 10 am for our party at noon - perfect timing. The shirts turned out great but the service was the reason I had to write a review and would definitely use or refer Rush Order Tees again whenever I can. Thank you so much!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:12:19.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

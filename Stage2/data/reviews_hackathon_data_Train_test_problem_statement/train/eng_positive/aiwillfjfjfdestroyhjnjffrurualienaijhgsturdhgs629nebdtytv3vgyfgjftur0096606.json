I was amazed at how quickly the box arrived from TOMTOP (a few days) with everything as advertised. However, there were no instructions on how to put the thing together. So I emailed support asking for their help. They immediately sent back a PDF of instructions which, unfortunately, was printed in Chinese. I was able to go on google and get the PDF translated enough that it was usable, although not as complete as I would have liked. But, overall, I am very pleased with the results of my dealing with TOMTOP and have no reservations at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:07:20.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

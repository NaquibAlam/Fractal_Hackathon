It's wonderful knowing exactly what I'm putting in my body, and the convenience of having tampons delivered so that I never run out is invaluable. The only drawback to LOLA is the cost, which is about twice that of my old brand. Although it only amounts to a few dollars more a month, I know some women who would be unable to afford the extra expense. That is why I plan to continue my LOLA subscription and to sing the praises of this company in hopes that a higher demand will help drive down the price and make these products accessible to all women, no matter their income.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:09:34.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

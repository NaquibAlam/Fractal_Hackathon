She worked with us with recommendations and did all the window measuring. When the shades and blinds arrived an appointment was set up and the day and time were met. We did have one small problem with one of the wooden shades. The installer made note of it and a reorder was put it. Casey Donaldson contacted me with the ship date for the replacement. Casey keep in contact and also set up the additional installation. We did have a problem when the new shade arrived as the installer gave them them the wrong shade to reorder. I informed Casey and again Casey was right on it by keep me informed of the new delivery and installation date (all within two weeks). I have dealt with quite a few customer services reps in the past but Casey will also stand out to me as the best. Communications were great and everything came out as expected. The shades and blinds are absolutely beautiful and if I ever need to order window treatments in the future I will diffidently come back to Smith & Noble", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:49:22.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

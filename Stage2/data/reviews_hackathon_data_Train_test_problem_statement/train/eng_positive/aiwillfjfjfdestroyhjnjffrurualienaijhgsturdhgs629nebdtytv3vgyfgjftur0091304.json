Made my decision based on their customer service, starting with the sales representative who answered very clearly all the questions I had and at no point was \"pushing for the sale\" but rather provided me with the information needed to ensure I was making the right decision (considering the long term contract). Afterwards, the tech support to complete the installation of my system was also very helpful and explained to me each step for the system configuration. Highly recommended !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:16:52.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

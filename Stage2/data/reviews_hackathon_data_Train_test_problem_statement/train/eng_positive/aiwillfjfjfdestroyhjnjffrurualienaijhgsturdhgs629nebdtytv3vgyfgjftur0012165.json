I suffer from anxiety and chronic back pain, so she recommended CBD during the daytime so I can remain functional, and Indica at night for when It's time to relax.\nI had been mostly smoking Sativa dominant hybrids, and it might have even contributed to my anxiety. She let me know Indica is perfect for relieving anxiety. She also told me that too much calcium and milk can contribute to internal inflammation.\nShe seemed interested in giving me advice that can actually help me, and I felt a genuine care for her patients. The meeting may not have been very long, but it was jam-packed with pertinent, useful information on how to start feeling better.\nThank you, HelloMD! And thank you, Dr. Sharon Olson!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:21:31.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My Financial Lively Hood Literally rides of my trucks being up and running 24/7/365. I researched both locally and online for Highest Quality, Reputation, Warranty and Price as my priority because of my needs for Dependability. Street Smart won out. I have rolled the dice and I have intentionally waited until now to complete this review. The Transmission from Street Smart has Performed Outstanding. The Transmission just turned 14K miles since Installation. I have had Extremely Heavy loads on the Flatbed it is installed in, and it has done an outstanding job. I Highly Recommend Street Smart Transmission. If the Transmission fall's short of the 100k Mile Warranty (Commercial Vehicle), I believe they will Honor the Warranty as they Guarantee. Street Smart is the Clear Choice thus far!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T15:39:21.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

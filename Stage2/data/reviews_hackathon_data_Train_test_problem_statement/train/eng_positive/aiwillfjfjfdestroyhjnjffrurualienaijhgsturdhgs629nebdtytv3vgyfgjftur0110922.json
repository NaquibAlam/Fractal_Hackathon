Most recently (2 Feb 2017) I called them at midday regarding a malfunctioning light switch, and Chris the electrician was here within the hour, with everything done and sorted an hour later. Living as I do in a Victorian conversion, the plumbing has had a fair few 'challenges' over the years and Pimlico Plumbers have been so helpful, including emergency callouts as well as less urgent matters. Unfailingly professional, always well qualified, tidy, paperwork that's spot on - and most importantly, they have always just set to and solved the problem. What a breath of fresh air. I'm very happy indeed to recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:39:00.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

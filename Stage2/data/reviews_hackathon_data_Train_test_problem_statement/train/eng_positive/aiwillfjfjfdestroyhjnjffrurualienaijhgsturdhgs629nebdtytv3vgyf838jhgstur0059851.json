Unfortunately all the used book stores in my area have shut down over the last couple of years. The free shipping if you order $10.00 was what made me try them and the amazing collection of books is what keeps me coming back. Can always find what I am looking for and the price is usually around $3/$3.50 per book. Since I read ALOT am able to puchase many books and not break the bank. If you join their club, discounts are available, making the price even better. They have become my go to for books.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T03:59:01.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

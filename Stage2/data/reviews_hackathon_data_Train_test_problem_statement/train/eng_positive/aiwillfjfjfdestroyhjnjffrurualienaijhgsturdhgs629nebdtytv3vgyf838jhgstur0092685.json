My first impression of the company was very positive compared to their competitor. They have retained a very personable, professional staff to assist with the on board process to become a driver. Lyft has always shown they respect me in terms of my time, my commitment, and my feedback. Daily emails or texts are the norm, where feedback of how I'm doing is shared. The app is easy to navigate and any questions I've had are answered within a reasonable time, usually the same day. Passengers have relayed much high praise for Lyft as well; quality drivers, timliness, and professionalism. Lyft has really changed the drive in Portland Oregon!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:11:40.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

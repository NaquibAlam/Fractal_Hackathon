It took a week for the product to get here. Sure, there are other, really expensive options, but I ordered condoms. Who wants to pay more than the actual product in shipping?\nBut still, 5 stars all the way for Jimmyjane. I received updates, they checked in to make sure I was satisfied (with the product of course *cough*) the package arrived discretely with no damage and wrapped appropriately. No complaints - just wish there were cheaper and faster shipping options, but that doesn't detract from the overall experience for me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:47:09.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

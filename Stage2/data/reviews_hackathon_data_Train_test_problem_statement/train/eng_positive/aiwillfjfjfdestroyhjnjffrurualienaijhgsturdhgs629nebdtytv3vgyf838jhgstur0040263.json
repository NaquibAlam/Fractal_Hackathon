And via a link we made a reservation. So far, so good.\nBUT when we stood at the Avis desk after arrival we realized that the company didn't know anything at all about our reservation, which means that Avis actually could have run out of 4WD cars.\nThere were enough cars, though, but there wasn't a Jeep available. Instead we got a Hyundai Santa Fe - which is alright, it's a fine car.\nI'll forgive the clerk for trying to \"sell\" us a fancy Cadillac Escalade.\nBut should I forgive him for knowing absolutely nothing about tyres when we asked - and we did, becauce we were going into the mountains?\nHaving come to a foreign country we wanted of course a GPS. The clerk didn't tell you (or he didn't know) that there was a fine GPS in the Hyundai. Sitting in the car we realized this and we wanted to cancel the additional GPS ordered. Back in the office, meeting the clerk, he accepted the cancellation.\nWhen we returned the car we were in a hurry and didn't notice that there was a GPS put on the bill! We have paid CAD 199,95 for it!\nWe don't blame AirportRentals for this.\nBut we definitely blame Avis, and we are now trying to get our money back!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T15:43:13.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

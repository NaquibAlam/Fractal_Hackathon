We covered about 18 counties, about 13 castles/manors/abbeys, Cliffs, sheep farm/dogs, mountains, lakes, hawks and ruins.\n3 nights at Ashford Castle was definitely the highlight. 2 nights at PowersCourt was also excellent\nWe will be back to cover the Southern area and Ring of Kerry. Maybe this Spring.\nA very attentive and wonderful staff.\nThank you all,\nSteven Whitten", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:49:55.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

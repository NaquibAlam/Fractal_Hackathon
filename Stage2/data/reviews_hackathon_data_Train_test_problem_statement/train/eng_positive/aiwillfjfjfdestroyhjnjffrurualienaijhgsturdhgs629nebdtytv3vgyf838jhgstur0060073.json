Communication was good and the only surprise was that I had to pay some import fees ($33) once the Blitz ZZ-R coilovers got state side. Even with that the overall price was hundreds lower than what I could have gotten here in the states. They answered all of my questions quickly and without any attitude at all, nor was there any pressure to buy once I'd opened up dialogue on the possible purchase.\nIf the strength of the dollar continues to rise and Nengun's pricing continues to reflect that, I'll certainly be buying from them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T23:19:58.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

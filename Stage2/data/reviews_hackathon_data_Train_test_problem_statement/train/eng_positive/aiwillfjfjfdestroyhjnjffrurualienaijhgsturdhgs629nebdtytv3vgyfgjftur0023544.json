So I opened MacKeeper and was immediately contacted via chat by an assistant. I shortly discussed renewing my license. I also inquired about savings or a coupon which he provided me a code for a 15% discount without further discussion.\nHe wasn't pushy and didn't force me to allow himself or another agent to remotely handle installation, etc. I am now updated for 24 months which will transfer over should I need to upgrade my now 8 year old LT. Overall I was pleased with the experience and simplicity of the process and product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T18:50:11.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I shopped around for a good price and was very happy with the prices here. The sunglasses are beautiful, arrived quickly and were packaged safely.\nI did have to pay the FedEx duties and get refunded. Keep all your FedEx paperwork. If you do not send the exact page they need it will not be possible to get the refund. I sent the wrong page initially, it did take me a while to get the right page. Once I did I was refunded very fast. I would recommend this company to anyone. Buy with confidence. I wanted to share my experience because I thought it could happen to anyone. The others I read either had no problem with the customs charges or they were unable to recover the customs. The company was always easy to communicate with and clear about what they needed. The customs charges were around $30. I almost would have paid this and still felt I got a fair price. I was much happier to get it back of course!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T05:18:15.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

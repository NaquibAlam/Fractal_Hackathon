I tried all the department stores and no such luck finding the right dress that would fit my 5'7\" 13 year old . I used the prom girl measurement tool and It saved me ! The measurements were spot on (it told me to go up in dress size, and again I had reservations, but I did it. The prom Girl measurement tool was spot on! The dress is absolutely gorgeous and true to color and FITS PERFECT!!! I'm extremely picky and I grew up with a mother that sewed .

The only trouble I have had was in respect to feedback from my \"Speeding events\". For a company that has GPS, Gforce detector, and more installed in my car, they could not give me any information on the reason for my gaining of the \"Speeding event\" other than a four hour window, the speed I was going, and that it occured on an \"Other road\". I have managed to guess that the \"Other Road\" is the turn off from the motorway, and I was not slowing down fast enough before the box applied the new speed limit. Because they track me, I cannot even contest the details.\nI rarely get them, but it is an annoying tick that I cannot get more information so that it does not happen again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:00:09.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

So, when the chair reclined, it messed up the frame before breaking the bolts. That shows how powerful the motor is on the chair. Ogawa did not hesitate about replacing it with a new one. However, the color was unavailable due to Christmas sales. Once in stock, it was sent out again and assembled by a service tech, instead of a delivery man.\nI have now used this chair everyday for almost two months and am extremely please with the company, sales staff, quality and effectiveness. This is the third brand message chair purchased and also the most advanced. The other popular brand chairs purchased did not hold up well and only gave temporary relief, but the Ogawa 3D is a true blessing.\nI am a professional freshwater fisherman and after one neck surgery, three back surgeries and the doctors wanting to do another back surgery, I decided a better quality message chair might help and cost much less than another surgery. So, I did a lot of research before spending money on another chair. I wanted a chair to give long relief and save-off or eliminate another back surgery. As of now, this chair is doing exactly what I was hoping: almost all day pain relief, more flexibility, relaxation for better sleep and lots of massage options with the flexibility to adjust the intensity levels for different days.\nI believe you will be as pleased as I am with the 3D chair from Ogawa.\nBD", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T10:30:45.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

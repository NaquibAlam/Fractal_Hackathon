We were in awe at the reef and the many fish and sea turtles. This despite the reef having lost 67% of it's coral last year. The trip to the aboriginal cultural centre was wonderful, and the butterflies in the wild abundant. And cuddling a baby koala bear? Who could resist?\nThe hotels in Cairns and Sydney were everything I had asked for - budget friendly yet clean and with courteous staff and centrally located.\nThanks to Michelle and Ali for all their patience and help in planning our trip. We met several other couples who were using Goway and they all had nothing but praise for the company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:18:59.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

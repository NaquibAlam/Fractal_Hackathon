Managed to get to Watford where Europcar came to the rescue - they had a car available at short notice! Hired a small car on a one-way hire to Preston. Thanks to Trevor at Watford branch for patiently sorting my booking. And thanks to the great guys in Preston who processed my return on Saturday lunchtime. Very good value under the circumstances - will use Europcar again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T09:00:29.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

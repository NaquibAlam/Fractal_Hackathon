I was searching for a high quality pear shaped diamond with a high-grade cut producing a lot of sparkle, which is difficult to find for pear shape diamonds. Todd Gray helped me track down a beautiful pear shape diamond out of BGD's virtual inventory. The process of buying the diamond was simple and straightforward. From there I got in contact with Emily at BGD who helped walk me through the process of creating a custom ring. She was patient with me throughout the process and very timely with getting back to me. Although the custom route was expensive, I figured it was a one time purchase so I took the leap of faith. In the end, my custom halo pear shaped engagement ring turned out absolutely breathtaking. The CAD design and glamour photos don't do the ring nearly enough justice as seeing it in person. It's truly jaw dropping! I can't recommend Brian Gavin Diamonds or Todd Gray enough! If you speak with Emily at BGD, you will be in good hands. I will be \"visiting\" BGD again to create a custom wedding band in the coming months/year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:40:10.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

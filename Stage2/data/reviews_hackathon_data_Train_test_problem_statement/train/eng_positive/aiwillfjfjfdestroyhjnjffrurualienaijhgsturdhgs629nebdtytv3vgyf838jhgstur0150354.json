Today Robert Sage, who to his credit has stayed with me on this, opened a Skype remote session today. this revealed that I still needed to uninstall the Safer VPN App, before the network could open. I had learned recently that only way to get the App to trash was to Force Quit on the Apple menu. That done, I could then trash the App, empty Trash and so allow the new IKEv2 network to open. Seems my VPN troubles are over. Let's hope that's long term and my thanks to Jeevan and especially to Robert for 'staying the course'.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:50:38.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

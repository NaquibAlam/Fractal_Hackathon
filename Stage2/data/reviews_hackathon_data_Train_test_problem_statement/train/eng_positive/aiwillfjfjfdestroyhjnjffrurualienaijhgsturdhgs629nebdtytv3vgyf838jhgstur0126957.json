You can view the actual rock and turn it whatever way you want to view the cut and also view the interior of the diamond. I am a rookie at the diamond business, but I spent alot of time on the web trying to educate myself before the purchase. Brian Gavin came highly recommended by several of the sites I researched. I have a feeling you may pay a premium for a Brian Gavin diamond, but I think It is more than worth it, according to some of the other dealers I researched selling diamonds. When I received the diamond there was also included an ocular you could look through to see the cut,bevel,light etc. of the stone. All I could say was -WOW. I am just buying for investment ,but I would not hesitate to do business with Brian Gavin again. The sales reps name was Emily and she was absolutly fantastic. Kept me updated on the progress and movement of the stone and very polite and knowledgeble. Thanks guys and gals in Houston, Texas", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:43:31.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

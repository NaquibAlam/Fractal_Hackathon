He was so kind and was appreciative of my recent purchase. He even sent the nicest note in my shipment package and wanted to make sure everything was to my satisfaction, and if not would work with me anyway to achieve that. I felt like my business was really appreciated. Of coarse the item was in perfect condition when it arrived and could have not been wrapped any better. All items were individually wrapped and the shipment was very speedy.

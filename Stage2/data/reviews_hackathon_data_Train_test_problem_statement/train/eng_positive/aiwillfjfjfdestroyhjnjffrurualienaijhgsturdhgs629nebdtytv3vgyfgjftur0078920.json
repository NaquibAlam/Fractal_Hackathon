We had been looking for a Lavazza Blue, a k-cup style espresso maker, and after lots of research, we discovered WholeLatteLove.com and the price was the best we could find on the internet.\nShipping was spot on and we even received a 100ct of Lavazza Intenso Espresso without it being listed as part of the purchase. What a great surprise!\nWe absolutely love the quality of our daily espresso - or two - and the service provided by WholeLatteLove.com!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:59:02.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was very surprised that you used UPS ground. I live in Alaska and everyone either refuses to ship here or says it MUST go UPS second day for a considerable sum. Much to my surprise you shipped UPS ground which I really liked. That in itself tells me you care about your customers, that being said I plan to use your site whenever I'm looking for performance parts. An order processed fast and correctly shipped. What more could I ask for, oh reasonably priced items on an easy to use website. What a find in this day and age, thanks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:38:24.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

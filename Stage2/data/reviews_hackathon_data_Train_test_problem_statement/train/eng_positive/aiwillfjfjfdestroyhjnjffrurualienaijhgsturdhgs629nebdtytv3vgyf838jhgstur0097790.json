The day I walked into Extra Space and met Yolanda and Marlon, I knew it was going to be ok. They were friendly, made the process simple, guided me to the right-sized unit (without that input, I would have been back in a few days to upsize). I felt secure every time I visited the property. I made probably a total of 25-30 trips to our unit between filling and then emptying it. I would say that about 80% of those visits I saw Marlon on the property. That friendly visibility gave me the confidence that the property was safe. One day my husband failed to get our unit relocked correctly. The next day on a routine check, Marlon noticed our unit was not locked - he called me and I immediately drove down to lock it. I have appreciated the professional but fun time I have Janie, I love the way you roll!

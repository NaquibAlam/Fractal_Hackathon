I originally wanted a Barbour jacket but didn't want to pay their prices so looked at Country Attire's own brand. I chose a Lyndey olive green ladies wax jacket and am absolutely made up with the quality of it. It is everything it says on the description and I've worn it every single day since I received it. It's fabulous for winter weather and totally waterproof. It dries very quickly and the lining is very classy. LOVE the butterfly logo!!! The ordering process was easy and it came within 2 days with free delivery-cannot fault this company. I even recommended them to my sister who has now ordered the same jacket in blue!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T09:41:46.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The customer advised Chewy and not only did they credit the purchase and ask it be donated to a shelter they sent flowers to the client and their condolences. I gave it a try hoping that chewy was really that kind of company. Today, I received someone else's order. I called and advised the rep that answered my call. The rep was sweet, said she would contact the correct customer and send out their order. I asked if I could return the incorrect shipment and was told to donate it to a local shelter. So I will and because of this awesome interaction I'll also drop off a donation along with the order. Not because I have to but because it made me want to. My dog is fortunate, however so many others are not. It's refreshing to have a company care about customers as well as the community. Keep up the great work!! ðŸ’•", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:15:14.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

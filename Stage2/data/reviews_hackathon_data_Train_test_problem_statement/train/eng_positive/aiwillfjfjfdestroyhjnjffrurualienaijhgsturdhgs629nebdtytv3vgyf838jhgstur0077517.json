I've read through some of the reviews here, and I guess everyone will have a different experience. Although I've drank a lot of wine in my life, I've just started as a \"connoisseur.\" This is my first wine club, so I don't have another to compare it to.\nHowever, as a consumer, so far I like the service. I don't like the shipping cost🙁, but we love the different wines and how you can read information on each one; right down to what types of food/dishes would go best with them.\nThanks for the portable cooler. I was in the Navy, so I think it's hilarious that I have a cooler for my wine. Now, I can bust it out when I'm at an event! It's complete with travel glasses and a cork😂! Yes, I'm a true Sailor 😉👍💣!\nI'm kidding. I drink responsibly👍. But I DO love the cooler😆.\nIn any event, we hope to continue to have good service. I read how some people had problems cancelling or were sent things that they didn't want. I hope Vinesse cleared that up for those people. Whether it was the customer's fault, or Vinesse's, I hope everyone was able to resolve it fairly because that's what people like me would like to hear. That's why these reviews are here. People actually DO come in and read the reviews to try and make an informed decision. That's how you gain and keep customer's 😉.\nI also hope I don't have any issues after I click send on this review😂. I've been with this club for a few months now and we're OK so far. But if I do, I'll come back and write another honest and humorous review.\nThanks Vinesse👍.\nThanks for reading everyone! Happy drinking!\nWritten by: a RETIRED Navy FLYGRRL❤.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T06:47:14.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

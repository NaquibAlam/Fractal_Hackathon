It's very useful to have the dogs name on their bag and the scoop is great, there's little I hate more than having had to weigh out each portion with the previous food I used. Having the food delivered is a great plus too. The emails keeping you up to date with deliveries etc is really useful too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:31:08.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

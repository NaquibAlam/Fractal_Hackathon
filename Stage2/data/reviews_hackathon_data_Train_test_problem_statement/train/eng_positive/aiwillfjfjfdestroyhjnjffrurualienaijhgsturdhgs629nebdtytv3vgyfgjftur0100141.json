Three years ago I discovered this compression item. It has worked very well. We purchase a new set about every 8-9 months, as it's effectiveness begins to diminish. Before finding this product my mother's legs would become so swollen that she developed open sores that weeped fluid. Her left leg would become red, hard, would open up and sometimes bleed. These compression stocking and wraps keep her edema under control. My mother is also a diabetic with many health problems. She is also obese and gets very little exercise. She is able to wear the size Large short. I put them on for her. She is able to remove them by herself. She has a rather large abdomen which makes it difficult for her to apply them herself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T13:11:47.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

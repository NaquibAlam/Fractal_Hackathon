I bought a Fossil watch for my Mum for her birthday. Your technical staff online chat were great, helping out with my questions straight away before purchasing. Purchasing was easy and fast and the product was delivered super fast (4 days). The product was also just as explained and my Mum loves the watch. I was also surprised to get a $20 voucher for our next purchase. Thanks again and we look forward to buying off you again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:16:04.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

POV says they don't ship on weekends, nor on Federal holidays, which is clearly listed on their website, so I had no issue when it shipped on Tuesday, and arrived early on Thursday. Fast/Discreet shipping, the free grinder is top quality (nice and heavy, grinds well, 4 chamber w/ kif scraper), air tight container is well made, and the free glass mouth piece with my V2 Pro was the kicker for me. Over $60 in free products, for a vape that cost $79.95. As for the vape, slow rip, keep filling those lungs, great cloud production, and excellent flavor for about 75% of the session, last couple may have \"burnt popcorn\" taste expected in this range. All in all, i highly recommend this as a single session, personal at-home or on the go vape.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:34:41.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

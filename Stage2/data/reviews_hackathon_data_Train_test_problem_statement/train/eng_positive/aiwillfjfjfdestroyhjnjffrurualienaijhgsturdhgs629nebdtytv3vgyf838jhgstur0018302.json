I tracked the order to the point of export by Singapore Post but it never arrived after 25 days. I registered a inquiry with the shipper but it takes a long time to get a claim resolved. I contacted Banggood and told them I hadn't received my order and asked them to ship it again. I was told that the item was out of stock and they offered a full refund which was credited back to my credit card in a few days. Incredibly, a few days later the order arrived and it was exactly the ukelele I ordered in perfect condition. I contacted Banggood and gave them the news and gave them the go-ahead to charge my credit card again. Ada, the rep at Banggood was very helpful, courteous and professional throughout the process and answered my emails promptly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T05:51:15.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Usually my parcels arrive in good time and in good condition but sometimes a little later than their expected time particularly if Auspost is involved in the delivery. The Tomtop web site is easy to follow and they have a good range of products..Sometimes their English grammar in describing the goods is a little quaint,but the meaning is not compromised. I sometimes order from other sites in China but prefer to use Tomtop because of their reiiability and friendly service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:59:58.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

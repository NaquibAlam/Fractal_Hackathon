And was impressed the pricepoint of an obviously high quality device. After initially burning off any chamer residue from manufacturing , I ran a nicely packed chamber through the different settings. This unit is very impressive for overall flavor and product delivery and I will absolutely be showing this piece off to others. My only regret is not being aware when I ordered that I could order a water pipe adapter for it so thats forthcoming. They have a very unique grinder as well so maybe order both. Fantastic experience thus far!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:35:34.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

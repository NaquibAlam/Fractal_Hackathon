I use the star ratings and reviews to pick my caterers, which has delivered great options and a great outcome.\nRecently I did have an extreme delay with a delivery and the customer service team was exceptional. I did not have to ask for my situation to get escalated to a manager, they did that for me and continued updating me until the order was delivered!\nShout out to the Customer Service team that handled Las Vegas deliveries on 1/23! I truly appreciated you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:22:10.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Ingredients are fresh and high quality. Meals are easy to prepare even for inexperienced cooks, ready in under an hour and are always satisfying, tasty and reasonably healthy. We really enjoy the variety and the amount of time we save by not having to go to the grocery store multiple times a week. Their plans are very flexible: you can choose to get 3 to 5 meals for 2 adults, 4 adults, or 2 adults and 2 children. We currently use the 3 meal per week plan which leaves us the flexibility to prepare other meals or go out to eat if we want. I also love that we don't end up wasting food as they send you exactly enough to prepare the meal (though sometimes I wish we had leftovers!). My only complaint is that in one box we received the wrong recipe cards - this was very easily remedied by logging into my Hello Fresh account and looking up the recipes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:54:52.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

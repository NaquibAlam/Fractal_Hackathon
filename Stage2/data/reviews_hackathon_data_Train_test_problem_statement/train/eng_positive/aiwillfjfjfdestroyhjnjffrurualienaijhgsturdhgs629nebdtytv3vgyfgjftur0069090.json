I needn't have been. Ace staff where on hand to advise and reassure me. I purchased the tickets with an admin fee way below that being charged by other much more well known companies. On the match day, I followed the instructions on how to collect the tickets at Gillette Stadium. The Ace staff where exactly where they said they would be and my tickets where there waiting. This was my first trip to Boston and my first trip to watch the Patriots at Gillette stadium. I had a great time watching the AFC final between the Steelers and the Patriots, in fact, one of the most memorable sporting events I have ever attended. The disappointment had I not got the tickets would have been palpable but I needn't have worried about using Ace. Thanks for a most memorable trip and I will be recommending your company to family and friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:40:06.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Great communication and booking quickly confirmed. When we arrived in NZ were quickly bussed to the depot. Very friendly staff. We were hired a near new Toyota Corolla in excellent condition with reversing camera, lane departure warning, cruise control and auto. When we returned the car to the city depot we were dropped off at the cruise terminal.\nI cannot praise this company and staff enough.\nTrully 5 stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T07:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T13:48:19.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

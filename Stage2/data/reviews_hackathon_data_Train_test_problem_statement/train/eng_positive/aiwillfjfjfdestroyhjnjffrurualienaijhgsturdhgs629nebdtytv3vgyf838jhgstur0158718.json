The dishes are always healthy and delicious. The directions a re simple and often entertaining and enlightening! My wife works nights, so it falls to me to get dinner ready. I rarely spend more than 30 minutes getting dinner on the table and, if I'm on my game, may have it ready in 10 minutes. Most of the recipes are just beyond my creative abilities and that makes the meal feel like it was prepared in an upscale restaurant. We love Munchery!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T14:22:41.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

On receipt they were the wrong size (described as Golf Plus 2007 onwards on the website). However, the issue was found to be related to a wrong pattern on their computer system. On measuring and sending them the correct clip positons they sent me the correct set (actually the same as a Passat?!) The response to the original complaint was very fast and turnaround less than a week. Recommended due to this excellent customer service and good quality product üëåüèº", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:38:47.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

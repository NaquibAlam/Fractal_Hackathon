It is not the cheapest company but based on reviews it seemed like a reliable option. I chose the option to renew in 10 to 13 business days. After paying their fee, I found instructions to be thorough and clear. I talked with them on the phone a couple of different times and the reps were always courteous, knowledgeable, and helpful. I followed their written and verbal instructions to a T. They communicated by email several times during the process to document exactly where my application was. I appreciated this very much as it assured me that things were going along ok and all my docs had been received by them. My new passport arrived one day ahead of the time they told me it would be at my door. Note to self: Don't let your passport expire. It is expensive to do an expedited renewal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T21:46:32.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

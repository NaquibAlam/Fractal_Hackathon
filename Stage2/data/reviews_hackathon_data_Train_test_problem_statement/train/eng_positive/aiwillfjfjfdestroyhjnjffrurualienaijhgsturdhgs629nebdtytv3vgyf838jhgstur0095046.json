When I found the Bake a Wish website I thought - what a cool idea, send a birthday cake, and of course I knew my niece would be thrilled! After ordering the chocolate cake and sending it, before it got there I had images of a blob of chocolate arriving, I hadn't given thought to maybe cakes don't ship well. Totally not the case, my sister said there was SO much care given in how it was wrapped and securely packaged, she said as soon as they opened it the smell was HEAVENLY!!!! They said it was one of the best cakes they've ever had, so needless to say I will definitely be ordering from them again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T15:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:53:10.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

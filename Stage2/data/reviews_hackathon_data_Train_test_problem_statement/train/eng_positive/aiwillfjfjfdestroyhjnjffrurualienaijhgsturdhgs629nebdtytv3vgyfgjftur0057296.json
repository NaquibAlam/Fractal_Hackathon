Some items still exceedingly high priced {generally the most wanted items-even DVD oldies that are still extremely well liked such as The Addams Family or Tarzan with Johnny Weissmuller, among many others}.

It would be helpful to note in descriptions what region the DVD's can be played in.\nEven so I really like Oldies.com and highly recommend them to everyone.

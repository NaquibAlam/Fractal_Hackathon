I was already a big fan and this experience added to that. In last months box I didn't get the lizards ( reading some stuff on YouTube I'm not the only one ) and I was a little bummed. I did get a pack of craws instead of them so my item count was right. I kind of figured since I had enough items, I was just out of luck. I sent one email and was responded to very quickly by Taylor saying that my lizards were in the mail. I realize it's only a $5 pack of lizards but it just blew me away. With the fast response and instant product replacement , I'm LTB for life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T03:05:21.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

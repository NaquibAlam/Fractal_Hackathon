He plays pickleball three to five times a week, but always indoors. I looked at the nets on Amazon and other sites and Pickleball Central had the regulation height. I did look at the equipment when it arrived, and it was sturdy. I think the net is the best quality offered online. It was totally understandable that I had to pay shipping to return it, but at least I was not charged a restocking fee. I recommend this company and would buy from them again.\nNancy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:37:00.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

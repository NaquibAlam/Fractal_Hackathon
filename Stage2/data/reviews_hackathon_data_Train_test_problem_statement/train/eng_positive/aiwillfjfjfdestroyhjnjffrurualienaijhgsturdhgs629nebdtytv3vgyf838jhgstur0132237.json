Not just today, but all 3 or 4 times I called every person I spoke with was friendly and still followed their process consistently. Really this was all stellar customer service. They never acted annoyed or anything of the sorts that you can often get with customer service reps. Everything was crystal clear and easy to use, including the online chat. Thank you for making this easy. Oh and yes I saved money, about $50 a month comparing to what the previous owner was paying on their plan.

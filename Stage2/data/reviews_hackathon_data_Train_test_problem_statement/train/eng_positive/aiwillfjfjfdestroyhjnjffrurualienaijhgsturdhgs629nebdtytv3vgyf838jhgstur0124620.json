I needed to quickly find furniture and with everything going on this could have been very stressful. Luckily I had a great experience that wasn't stressful in the least. The guy helping me was awesome and really fun. I did have to special order a small dining room table and chairs. My living room set was at my house the next day! The automated updating was great. I was very happy with Gardner-White and Ron my super cool sales guy.

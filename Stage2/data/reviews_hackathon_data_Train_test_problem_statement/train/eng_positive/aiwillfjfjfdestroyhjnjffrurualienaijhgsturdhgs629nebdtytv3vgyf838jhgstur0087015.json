From broken promises of rates and no prepayment penalties by the bank \"with the horses\", to just utterly rotten service and failure to pay my taxes by the bank with the stuffed doggies, to not receiving my deeds of reconveyance when my mortgages were paid off, i have seen incompetence, malfeasance and indifference at all levels.\nEnter WesLend Financial. Night and Day! When I first spoke to my representative, Chris Walsh, he walked me through all the necessary documents that he needed. I had just gone through a divorce, so the ex's name was all over insurance policies, etc, and we worked together through all of that. The Loan Processor, Jehan Jreisat also worked with me on a daily basis via email or telephone to get all my documents electronically signed and collated. The appraiser that they sent was punctual, professional and very efficient. The notary that came over was very punctual, very well-prepared and walked me through each inked document. Even after the loan funded and wired into my bank account, Jehan followed up with escrow to ensure that my April tax bill had been paid to the county. This was truly a NO COST loan in that i paid no fees, points, closing costs AT ALL. Many lenders just load the back end of the loan with your fees and costs and call it a \"zero costs at closing\" loan, but you still pay for it for many years in the long run. WesLend has a business model that rebates those costs in escrow, so you truly have a NO COST loan. It really is the biggest no-brainer in the history of mankind! I am very pleased with my WesLend mortgage, and I highly recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T17:19:23.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

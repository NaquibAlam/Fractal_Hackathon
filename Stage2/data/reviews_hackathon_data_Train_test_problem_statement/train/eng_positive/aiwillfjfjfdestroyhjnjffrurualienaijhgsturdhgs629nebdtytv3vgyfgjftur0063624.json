Having used several exchange companies over the last twelve months and having much the similar experience and exchange rates with them all; I assumed this one would be very similar. How wrong could I have been! To my surprise the service was prompt, efficient and reliable and the exchange rate was much better than I had been getting . The online site was so easy to navigate and I was amazed the currency was in my overseas bank by the next day as promised .

I ALWAY'S book them for my domestic flights. The flights are always on time with departure & arrival times. As I have meetings shortly after arriving, and typically 2 hours before I depart from airport. It is impairative that my schedule remain's on time. They are very professional, precise with fast bookings, always provide best prices, great flight times. Truly I could'nt run my buisness with out your services. You make flying Enjoyable & Relaxing!! Thanks a million Flight Hub!!! Respectfully, Dawn. Miller", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:24:52.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

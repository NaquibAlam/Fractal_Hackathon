Surprise, i was given one month free which i did not expect. Also the insurance i accepted through the company as mine is much more due to the fact i mixed my personal items with items that belong to the church-ministry,\nAt my age most of the Chaplains did all the moving and the location had carts to help bring them to the locker , i had fun just pushing the buttons and riding up and down on the elevator with the items.\nYou need to be careful of the staff that helped us, she was great, organized and caring. One of our Chaplains told me we should hire her. (i promise i will not take her away from you) smile.\nThe place is very clean and comfortable with the climate control system. Once again it is a blessing to have this help as we urgently need somewhere to store our ministry items so we can sort them all out.\nIn His Service i Bless you,\nRev. Patrick White\nBishop/Senior Chaplain\nTHE CHAPLAINS OFFICE\n416-248-1252", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:59:07.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

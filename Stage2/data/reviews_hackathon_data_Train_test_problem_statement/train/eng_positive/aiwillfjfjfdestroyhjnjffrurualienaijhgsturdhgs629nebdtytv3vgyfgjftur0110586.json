I saw one in Charleston SC and asked around until I got the name of the tree. Next step was to research the genetics. At first glance it looks like a graft, but no. The wild type has red flowers, and the peppermint is a white mutant, but the mutation is unstable. Whenever it back mutates, you get red. The next challenge was to find a nursery that sells peppermint peach. That's where you guys shine. Thanks for coming through. The tree is in the ground in Fayetteville, AR.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T23:19:11.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The result, they paid! Not only did they pay what they promised, but the turnaround time was much faster than I expected. I mailed a physical giftcard to their mailing address given and I started to send it priority with confirmation. I felt at ease knowing it was going to a PO Box so I sent regular postage; though, they provide paid postage. Nonetheless, everything went smoothly and I received the cash for the card. I would definitely use them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:11:54.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

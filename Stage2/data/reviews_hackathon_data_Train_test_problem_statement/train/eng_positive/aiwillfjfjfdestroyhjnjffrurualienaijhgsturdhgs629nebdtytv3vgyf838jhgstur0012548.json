I was able to order the folder on Friday and receive it Tuesday.

There are multiple other handy helps - a removable part that makes it a three-ring binder and 12 strings for holding sheet music. It's high quality and I'm confident it can be used for many, many years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T19:15:47.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Altogether I'm satisfied with it. The only issues I've had is when the hotels themselves do things and ask for additional payments which they shouldn't. I've had this problem when I traveled with my dog and a hotel asked a huge fee for it although on booking.com it stated that it should be free and another time when the hotel asked for an upfront payment, although I already paid through booking.com. Booking either didn't responf to emails concerning this or was very slow to solve this after telephone calls. So they should try to harder to resolve issues promplty when they do appear (and this is of course inevitable).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:20:38.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My husband and I were bad at meal planning and we're starting to rely on fast food too much. I wanted variety. I have quite a few dietary restrictions and I loved the selection on HelloFresh compared to other food delivery services and that all the ingredients were separate so I could just leave them out or alter the recipe slightly to make a meal I could eat. Four or so weeks in and we haven't had a meal we didn't like and we are often surprised what we find ourselves liking best each week. And boy do the people at HelloFresh know how to make delicious sauces!!\nI give it a 4/5 because sometimes some of the vegetables aren't in the best shape or we've got wilted greens on the first night of a new box. But they are always salvageable to some extent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:32:05.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Their prices are very good. The cars are not so bad but if you want new, don't bother. Our vehicle adequately carried us from Auckland to Russell and then to Wellington via Hawkes Bay. While we would have preferred an automatic, the manual, once we were used to it, gave us no problems.\nBeing able to pick up in Auckland and leave in Wellington after a 15 day hire, without extra charge is a really great bonus and service.\nThe service, collection to and from the airport, is always very pleasant and quick.

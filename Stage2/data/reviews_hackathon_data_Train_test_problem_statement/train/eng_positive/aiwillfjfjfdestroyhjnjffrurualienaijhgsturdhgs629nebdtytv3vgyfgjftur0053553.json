We get serious snow, and serious cold. In 2000 a pipe broke and caused over $100K damage. After that, I started looking for a solution. I found it in February 2007... the FloLogic.\nWe had some installation hiccups, as back then the local contractors and plumbers had never seen such a thing, but once it was properly installed it worked great. Five times since 2007 we've had what could have been catastrophic flood events from leaks that were stopped by our FloLogic before they became more than a small puddle. The battery backup has worked flawlessly, and if the battery drains we've stayed protected.\nMy favorite features are: (a) IT WORKS; (b) the battery backup; (c) simplicity of operation via the small thermostat-sized control panel; (d) the alarm beep that sounds \"just loud enough\" to let me know there has been a leak event; (e) the adjustability; and (f) the set-it and forget-it programming.\nWe come in, push the Home button, and the FloLogic opens the valve on the water main to the house. It's that simple. After that, we don't have to touch it again. The FloLogic automatically shuts down the main line valve after 18-hours of no use, e.g., no faucets open, etc.\nIf there was a leak in our absence, when we come in the alarm (a not too loud beep) is sounding so we know to look around before pressing Home, and to run down any possible leaks.\nMy house has hydronic heating. If it's not operating at 100% it needs makeup water. With the FloLogic I can provide for that. I can also provide for leaking toilets, etc. The FloLogic helped me fix up my hydronics and leaking toilets by letting me know there was water running -- somewhere. Now my house is leak-free. Not an ounce of unwanted water can flow out without the FloLogic closing the main line and saving me tens, or hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.\nI highly recommend the FloLogic and I would very definitely buy it again.\nCAVEAT: Work closely with your plumber-installer. Mine installed the FloLogic while we were away and added a bypass pipe! That made the FloLogic totally useless. He had all the installation instructions and everything, but did it anyway. I had to make him come back and remove that silliness. Lesson Learned: Don't assume your plumber will understand how these things work.\nCAVEAT: Read the instructions -- all of them, including the installation data and the programming. The complaints I see in these reviews all reveal the poster had issues understanding or implementing the programming. It's not hard, but it does require attention. The programming is what you live with day-to-day. It is well worth the effort to learn how to use the system properly for your situation.\nSUGGESTION: WiFi / iOS App interoperability. It would be great to be able to monitor and turn on/off my FloLogic(s) remotely for housekeeping, guests, etc..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:56:50.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

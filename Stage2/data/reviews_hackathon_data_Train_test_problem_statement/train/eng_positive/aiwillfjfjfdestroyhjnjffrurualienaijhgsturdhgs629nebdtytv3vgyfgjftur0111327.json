I put the plants in the ground anyway, and put a wire waste basket (that was covered with a plastic bag) over them. Since we live in a desert, the evap rate is 1200 inches a year - while the precipitation rate is only 12 inches a year. So retaining the water from the drip water system is vital. Initially, I thought only 2 plants (with .25 inch leaves) would live. But by 18th feb 2017 - all plants were producing leaves. NOW we have to see if the plants make it through the brutal summers here in Tucson.( When shipping long distances, you may wish to trim off leaves over 0.25 inch in diameter - or trim to 1/4 inch long leaves.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T23:59:45.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

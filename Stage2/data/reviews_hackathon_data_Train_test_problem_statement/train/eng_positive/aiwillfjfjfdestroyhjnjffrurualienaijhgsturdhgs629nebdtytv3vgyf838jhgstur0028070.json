Robin Sabine our Travel Consultant from Costa Rican and Panama Vacations did an excellent job of arranging everything for us. It was our first experience going through a travel agency for international travel and she made it so easy. We made changes a couple of times about a month before leaving and she was very patient and accommodating through the whole process.\nThe hotels she selected for us \"The Panamonte\" in Boquete and \"Bocas Del Mar\" in Boca Chicha were perfect accommodations with beautiful views, great restaurants, awesome staff, (Even if they did not always speak English) and plenty of extra curricular activities to provide us with plenty of choices.\nWe plan to use Robin and in the future for our next venture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T23:01:44.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

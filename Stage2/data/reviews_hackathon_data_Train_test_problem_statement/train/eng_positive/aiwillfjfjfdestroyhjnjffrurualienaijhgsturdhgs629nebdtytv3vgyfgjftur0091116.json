After exploring both local and Nationwide name recognizable companies offering monitoring, we decided to go with the Galaxy Home & Yard System. It offers flexibility in movement around the home, but more importantly, the ability to communicate directly with someone through the neck pendant without having to be near the Base. Mom can go downstairs or outside and if required, still be able to speak to someone, even if it's a false alarm (no unnecessary phone calls unlike other systems). It's easy to use and set up. The absolute best part however is the Service. Small town feel. In my case, Chris offered his father's service to drive an hour away, to set up the device and ensure that everything's in working order. And whenever replacement batteries are required, they don't hesitate to provide you with new ones. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. And if you're concerned about price, go ahead and compare but you'll come back to Galaxy. For what they offer and at the price, your loved ones are worth it and you'll be reassured as will they.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:14:49.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I hit a pothole\nand blew out my front tire. I made my appointment and was told I should replace all of my tires due to the AWD feature of my car. When I got to town fair the gentleman who helped me out told me that wouldn't be necessary but he did point out a bubble in my back tire that I did not see before. Most salesman would have pushed 4 tires on you at that point but he told me that wouldn't be necessary. Great experience, I would certainly recommend town fair just because of the great service I got.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:08:51.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The recipes are fairly easy to follow and so far, all have been very tasty. There are some I like more than others - naturally - but all of them have tasted great. Food always arrives on Wednesday evening. I can easily pick out what meals I want to receive each week on the app and then rate them based on my personal experience. This company has brought my husband and I together to make dinner and to sit down and actually eat dinner together. Surprisingly, he's finding that he likes to actually cook. I had one box that arrived with something either opened or leaking and a quick message to Hello Fresh - and they refunded my entire week! That is great customer service! I'd recommend Hello Fresh to anyone - it really is very good and it makes cooking and planning dinner so much easier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:25:05.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

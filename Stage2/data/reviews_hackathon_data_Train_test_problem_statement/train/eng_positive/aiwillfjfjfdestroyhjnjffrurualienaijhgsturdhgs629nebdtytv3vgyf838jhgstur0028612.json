It was by far the best vacation we have ever had. We were able to explore the Arenal area; hanging bridges, waterfall, day/night hikes, hot springs and much more. We loved socializing with the villagers and we ate at some amazing restaurants our favorite was Los Nenes in La Fortuna. We were also able to relax by the beach towards the end of our vacation; playa conchal. It was breathtaking; watching the sunset while drink cocktail, snorkeling in the North Pacific Ocean, trying to Paddleboard and visiting a secluded beach. Our vacation could not have been better planned, Thanks to Costa Rican Vacations Felicia Clarke.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:59:40.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Staff very helpful and nothing to much trouble. I booked a delux twin and on checkin was upgraded to an executive room with garden view with amazing views over looking the river and London eye. Room was of good size and nice to have a tv in the bathroom also a full mini bar of complimentary drinks (alcoholic / soft drinks) and snacks. Lots of extra treats such as Elmis toiletries, magazines, slippers,robes and a box full of essential travel items in the bathroom. We also had a complimentary box of hand made chocolates in the room. Bed was very comfortable. There was a good choice of breakfast in a nice environment. It was a very enjoyable and luxury stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T09:47:47.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

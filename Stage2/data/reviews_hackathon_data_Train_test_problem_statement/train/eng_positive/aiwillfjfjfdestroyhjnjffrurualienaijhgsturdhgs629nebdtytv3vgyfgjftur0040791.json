My only reservation is, I tried to place this order on my iPad and it was an extremely frustrating disaster. Like, I almost didn't order anything with the company, it was that bad. The engraving function kept deleting what I put in each line, kept trying to auto-correct (please don't tell me I should've turned this off on MY end, I shouldn't have to work that hard to buy your stuff). I ordered from my PC and it worked OK, though. I'd give 5 stars, but it was extremely upsetting, ordering a stein for my husband's client and having your website autocorrect in error, erasing what I managed to type in, etc. Really messing with my head, and it wasn't appreciated. Recalling the magnitude of frustration, I'm being incredibly generous, giving four stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:25:34.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

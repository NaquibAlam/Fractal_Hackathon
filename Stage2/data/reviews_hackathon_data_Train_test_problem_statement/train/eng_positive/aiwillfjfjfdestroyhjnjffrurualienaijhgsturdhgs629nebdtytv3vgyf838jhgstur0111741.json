The entire crew was amazing! Smiles and so helpful! Despite bad weather, the captain did what he could to help (including altering our route and staying in port at Grand Turk all night so we could enjoy the weather there) and the rest of the crew trying to do everything to keep us safe, happy and entertained! Food was great! HIGHLY recommend The Black Crab! Thank you MSC crew for everything! What a great experience! Other guests on board were friendly also, how wonderful it is to meet so many people from different backgrounds and cultures! The kids made some good friends they had a hard time saying goodbye to also!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:26:39.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

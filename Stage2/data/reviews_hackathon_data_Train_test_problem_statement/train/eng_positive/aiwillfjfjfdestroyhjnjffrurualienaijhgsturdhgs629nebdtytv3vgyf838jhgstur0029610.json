It allows you to \"build\" multiple cars and get offers. I had all 5 offers within 24 hours. When you accept an offer it makes the ordering process so easy as the dealer can see your exact build. It takes all the legwork out of visiting multiple dealers and haggling. I saved over Â£5000 over list price on my Vauxhall Mokka X.

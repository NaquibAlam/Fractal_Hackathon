Smaller things like coffee tables lamps chairs etc. I've been to other funiture stores and it's all pretty standard. You walk in, pick something you like or something out of a catalog and you place your order. Not here, the staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and professional! I don't ever walk out of there feeling like I got hustled. I leave happy and i've been shopping with rich for close to 4 years now. Just furnished my little sisters room and everything was very easy to assemble. The bedframe was easy, desk chair was easy, lamps were easy. The desk took me 1 hour& 20 minutes to assemble but only because i'm slow with the drill Lol the instructions are and always have been on point. I had a couple questions and called in and they took the time to explain everything to me. They didn't rush me off the phone knowing i wasn't calling about a sale. Highly recommended with incredible prices!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:40:18.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

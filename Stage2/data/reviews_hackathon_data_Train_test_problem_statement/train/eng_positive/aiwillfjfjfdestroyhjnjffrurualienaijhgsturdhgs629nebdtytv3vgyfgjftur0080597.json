Took about 10 mins.\nThe tour was great. We were taken to amazing view points overlooking the city, down tiny backstreets, and to the cafes where the local go. But the best thing was being able to ask questions about the city as we went, and get the insider knowledge and recommendations for the rest of our trip.\nI think when you get to a new city using a guide to show you around is invaluable. You get so much more out of your time there once you have got your bearings and can recognise a few landmarks. The added benefit of the best restaurant and bar tips means that you can avoid the tourist traps too!\nI will use these guys again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T20:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:44:03.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

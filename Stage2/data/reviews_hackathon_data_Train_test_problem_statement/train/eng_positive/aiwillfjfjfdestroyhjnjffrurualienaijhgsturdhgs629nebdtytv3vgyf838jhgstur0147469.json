I retreated from my reservations after seeing a vehicle on the lot which appealed to me-saw the vehicle as I drove by. I turned around and decided to file an application for credit. After doing so, I toured the parking lot for other cars and found a couple which really piqued my interest but the car which most impressed me was the one I purchased the same day. The vehicle was in the showroom and ready for me-what serendipity I experienced as a result of visiting Oak Motors and seeing MY car.\nI was directed to deal with Alec. He was quite affable and patient, at my coercing he went with me on my test drive. He was conversational and explained matters to the nth detail. I was impressed by his candor and professionalism. He was kind, he helped me make decisions as I talked them out. Again, without coercion, he was present for me to troubleshoot logistics of turning in my rental, offering me his cell phone to call and allowing me to use the Internet to add my car to my insurance. He helped me transfer my belongings from the rental to the Kia Soul I purchased and he did not stop there, he gassed up my car...WAY TO GO!\nI was able to make a decision, though quick and I do not like quick decisions, I purchased my Kia and was given good service. I noticed some things prior to my purchase and Alec was kind enough to instruct me on how to have the issue remedied. I have been bothered by the circumstances which brought me to Oak Motors but Alec truly helped ameliorate my angst, should necessity dictate, I would return and recommend Alec to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:27:37.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

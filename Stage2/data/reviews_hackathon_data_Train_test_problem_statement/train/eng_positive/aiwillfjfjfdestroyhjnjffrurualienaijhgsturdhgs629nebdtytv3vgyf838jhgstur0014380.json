Easy mounting instructions especially after watching the video and they look sexy on my 15' Dyna.\nDraw backs: I was only sent one functioning key for my set of bags. The second key was completely cut different.\nThe support arm of the attachment bracket does not work for the XL bags with the shock cutout. The angles to attach the arms make it too far to attach this stiffener bar so I mounted without it. No issues.\nOverall I love these bags.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T20:20:40.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

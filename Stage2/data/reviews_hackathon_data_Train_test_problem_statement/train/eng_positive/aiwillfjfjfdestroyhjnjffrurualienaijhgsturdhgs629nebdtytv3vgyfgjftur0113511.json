When you feel that you are fully satisfied, then you may choose the design.\nAfter you choose a design, you get into the \"project handover stage\", in this stage you can still require revisions. DON'T TRUST IT. It's just useless. When you ask for revisions in this stage, you just get crap. The designer won't care about your words because he was already guaranteed to have the money.

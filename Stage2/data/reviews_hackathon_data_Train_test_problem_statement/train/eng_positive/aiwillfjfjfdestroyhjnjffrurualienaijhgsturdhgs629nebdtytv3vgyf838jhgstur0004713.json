My items arrived quickly and were better than I expected (high quality and really beautiful). The return process was simple. My only complaint is about the 10% re-stocking fee for an item that has been barely touched and still has tags on it. Because it's hard to tell what a true fit will be, I ordered two sizes of the same dress and it was a bummer to have to spend $30+ on a dress that I returned. But in the end, I'm very happy with this experience overall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:24:51.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

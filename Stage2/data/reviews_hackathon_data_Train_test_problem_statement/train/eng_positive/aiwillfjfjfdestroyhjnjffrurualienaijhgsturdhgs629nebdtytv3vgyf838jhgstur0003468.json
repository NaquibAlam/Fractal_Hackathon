We made one foray into internet advertising and were not pleased with the results or the cost. This time it was different. Using ZipRecruiter allowed us access to much better candidates and at a much more reasonable cost. We were actually so happy with the applicants that we wound up hiring two new employees when we had only planned on hiring one.\nThere is another important point about working with ZipRecruiter that I need to make as well. Due to my own oversight I had inadvertently signed up for automatically renewing our ad. When the second charge posted to our business account I signed on to the live chat. ZipRecruiter's service representative Tatianna was great. Before we finished the chat I had an e-mail confirming our refund. It was that quick with no additional sales pressure whatsoever. The next time we need to advertise for a new employee, it will be with ZIpRecruiter again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T14:58:20.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

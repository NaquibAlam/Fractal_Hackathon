The curtains are the perfect length but would have preffered they hide the curtain pole, had I known in advance to add XX cm for this to happen, I would have requested a longer length.\nOnline ordering was simple and quick, PayPal an option and within 14 days my curtains were in place.\nThey look great, the finish is superbe and I got the curtains I wanted rather than something similar to what I had in mind.\nNot the cheapest option, but worth every penny. The way I see it is that they're only going to cost me Â£19 a year for the next 10 years.\nOverall happy with my purchase and would most certainly buy from Curtaind2go again as the range and choice is so diverse in comparison to store bought.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:24:56.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

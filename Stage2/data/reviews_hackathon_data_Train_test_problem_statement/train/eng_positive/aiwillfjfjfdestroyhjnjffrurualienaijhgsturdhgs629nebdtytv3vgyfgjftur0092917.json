So far I have placed 2 orders and I cannot say enough how FANTASTIC they are. I am owned by 9 ferrets . They love the Furovite and Ferretlax as treats. However my store charges 13.99 for ONE 3oz tube! I took a chance and Chewy has the same brands for a hellavu lot less😄😄😄. As I said I've ordered twice so far and my order has been delivered in LESS then 24 hours!👍👍. This is a fantastic company and one that I look forward to continue ordering from in the future. Thanks Chewy! So far I have told all my friends who have pets about you!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:15:06.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Making the invitation was so much fun, and very easy to do. The ability to add music and photos is a plus. Like the messaging ability to communicate with invitees, and the ability to customize the details page to inform people of hotel arrangements and other activities associated with the event. Nice to be able to see who has opened the invitation. Has been a great experience, and have gotten a lot of compliments on the invitation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:19:27.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

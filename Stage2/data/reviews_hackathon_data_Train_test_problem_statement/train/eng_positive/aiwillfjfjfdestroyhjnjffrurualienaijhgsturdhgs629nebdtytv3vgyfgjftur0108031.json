There were information about the dress on the pictures provided, but they were in Japanese. This dress is hopefully for my prom dress if I like the material of the dress. I was a bit hesitant on ordering the dress because again the detail portion that was in English was very small. Though overall I was very satisfied with the pictures, prices and the variety of dresses. I will be buying from here again in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:18:49.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I work with Andrew Schwartz and I always receive a reply within a 1-2 day time frame and the replies are always friendly and extremely helpful.\nMy first box never got shipped and Andrew took care of everything and got my box to me within the next week.\nUsually when I deal with customer support via email from other places I usually don't hear back until a week or so later and but I just love how fast of a response I get to any concerns I have with my LTB.\nI've been recommending LTB to everyone I know that enjoys fishing. This box was a gift to my husband and he just absolutely loves it and gets super excited each month when he knows he'll be getting his LTB.\nThanks LTB.\n-Jennifer V.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T03:17:02.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

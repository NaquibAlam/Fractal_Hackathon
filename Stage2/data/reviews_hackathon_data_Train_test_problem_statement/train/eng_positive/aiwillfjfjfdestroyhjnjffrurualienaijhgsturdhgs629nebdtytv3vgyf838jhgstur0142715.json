We've tried the most premium of them all and thought that's it, nothing else could match it, but it was too heavy on the wallet although worth it, only difference is it was based in Switzerland and also had premiu end-points that have no suspicion or confirmation of network sharing or proxies. Hence you'd pay a premium for that.\nAside from that, here I believe it has been done, can't fault it at all for the price and has all the necessary features for what it set out to do and MORE, yet with out unnecessary 'marketing type' bells and whistles adding bloat and slowing things down eventually through resource hogging GUIs and complex code to over complicate things.. here it's sleek, it's fast and worth every cent. And has some surprises too. We are curious at the technical know how of pple who rated any less than 4... they should go try some others and see how protected they REALLY are...\nOutstanding guys, thanks and support is 6STARS! Only issue now is reviewing this violates our privacy, but we want to do it as we believe in small business > large corporations.. and here it is very deserving.

For many years I used prescription medication for allergy (2 kinds in the hay fever season). Early 2014, on a hunch I tried this paste instead. It has a strong unpleasant taste, but it works wonders for my respiratory system, and I've gone 3 years without other meds. I assume this is due to the anti-inflammatory effect.\nA friend now uses it also for inflammation of bursea in her joints.\nLately people suggest it has an effect on depression, but sadly we haven't seen that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:08:19.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

You can preview some of the loops and a demo of a track made with the loops before you purchase the pack. The welcome package should also give you a good idea of what you can expect from these packs. Do note that some packs only contain construction kits and some FX, so be sure to check what you get before buying the pack.\nI had a minor issue with one pack: \"Enigmatic Space Electonica\" it does not contain seperate sounds besides around 70 FX which I most likely won't use. The other things are construction kits. With the construction kits you can make some good tracks and it also contains some great tracks and many decent tracks which are already pre-made. The construction kits are good for making remixes. My issue is that I would have wanted all loops to be seperate ones rather than full lines of a certain type (for example: basslines, synths, chords, drums, etc)\nBut other than that, it was a good buy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T01:05:41.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

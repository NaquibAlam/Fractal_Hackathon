Had no updates on-line on order status through January and February - called occasionally and was only told that order would ship when all items were ready. At end of February, on another persistent call in, finally told that the Stella size I ordered never came in from grower. Staff person who helped me was great in changing order to smaller size Stella and adding a blueberry bush to order so no refund or additional charge. Plants doing well so far. I must criticize, though, in that if I didn't call them and persist in status of order, I might still be waiting for the order to ship, so communication to customer of true and current status of orders needs to be improved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:42:48.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

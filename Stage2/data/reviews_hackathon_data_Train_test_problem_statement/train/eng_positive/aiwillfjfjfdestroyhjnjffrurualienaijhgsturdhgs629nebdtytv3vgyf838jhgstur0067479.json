We had made plans for a lengthy vacation and were at a loss of what we were going to do regarding the care of our precious dog. We went on TrustedHousesitters and within a few days we found a lovely couple who were available to sit for us. It was such an amazing experience - fabulous, reliable, trustworthy people who loved and cared for our dog as if he were their own, as well as taking care of our home in the same manner. It couldn't have been a better experience. We went away totally worry-free. We were sorry to see them leave after we got back. We will absolutely use TrustedHousesitters again in the future! Thank you TrustedHousesitters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T13:16:58.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

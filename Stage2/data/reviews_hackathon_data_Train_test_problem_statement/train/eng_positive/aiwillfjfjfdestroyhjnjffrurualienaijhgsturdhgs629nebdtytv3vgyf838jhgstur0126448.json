The color works very well with our home style which is \"Texas Tuscan\". It's sort of a yellowy amber but very subtle. Very pleased that these bulbs don't use much energy at all but are pretty bright. In fact, each of our lanterns has a place for 4 bulbs but we currently only use 2 bulbs in each. The bulbs themselves are a little tacky to the touch but I'm assuming this is the coating that gives them the yellowy amber color.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T15:22:27.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

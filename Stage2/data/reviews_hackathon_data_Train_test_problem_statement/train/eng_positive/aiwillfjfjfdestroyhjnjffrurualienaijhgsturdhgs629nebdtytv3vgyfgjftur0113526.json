He has been wearing Funky Trunks for years, however, the Funky Trunks website did not have his size. Zodee had everything we needed. Shipping was quick to the United States and communication in reference to an item that was out of stock, was quick as well. In addition, they sent the cutest little Koala Bear in it's own pair of Funky Trunks! What a delightful surprise! Thank you for such great customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T19:13:08.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

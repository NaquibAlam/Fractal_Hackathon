The letter was very nice, showing me what I need to improve in my English and what I should check before I turn the paper in. Then I loved what she did with my paper! It was the same but it sounded so much more sophisticated after her corrections. She also added comments where she did not understands something clearly, which were very welcome.\nI uploaded the paper on Friday night and paid for the correction within 3 days. I expected to have it back by Monday night. Additionally I uploaded the rest of my paper on Sunday morning and paid for 24h correction. I got both parts back by 6 in the morning on Monday. That means I won back one day! Awesome!\nThe corrections were worth every penny and I would definitely choose Scribbr again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:53:06.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

What a wonderful, wonderful time we had in Costa Rica. I have had many wonderful trips in my 60 years, but my husband and I agree, this is a trip at the top of the list.\nWe loved it...the volcano, the guided \"hanging bridges\" hike, our lodgings (wow!), the private beach at Buena Vista Villas, the food, the birds and animals, our travel arrangements and drivers...it was quite a vacation.\nThank you so much to \"Costa Rican Vacations\" for all of the work you did to arrange this, and to all of the people who helped and were involved. Andre, who picked us up at the airport and helped us shop for beer, wine, and a cooler...(!) and then took us to a restaurant where we ate my favorite meal of the trip, was so great...allowing us to stop for photos...telling us about Costa Rica and his family...he was such a great \"first contact\" for us! The staff at Kioro was terrific! Adrian and Richard, who drove us, also great. Carlos, who led our hanging bridges tour....so knowledgeable and MADE that tour for us. The staff at all lodgings and restaurants and shops were soooo kind, smiling, happy, and helpful...everyone with whom we had contact made such an impression on all of us. Maria at the Villas was SUCH a help.\nAfter our first day we felt the Cerro Chato hike might just be too much for our group. (I really wanted to do it and still feel a bit badly that we didn't, but agreed with my family we probably should not.) So, then, I felt so badly that we had already paid and wouldn't be going. A young woman in reception at Kioro offered to call Costa Rican Vacations. She put me in touch with Yermi in the office. He and I talked on the phone, emailed, talked again, and came up with an alternative plan for the day. I appreciate SO much that this was able to happen and that Yermi was so very kind, patient, and helpful. Our guide for that day, to the volcano and then the Fortuna waterfall and lunch...also great!\nALL of our arrangements, guides, drivers were prompt...and that is appreciated.\nI can't wait to return to Costa Rica....thank you, again, Emilie, for being the person that got all of this in motion!

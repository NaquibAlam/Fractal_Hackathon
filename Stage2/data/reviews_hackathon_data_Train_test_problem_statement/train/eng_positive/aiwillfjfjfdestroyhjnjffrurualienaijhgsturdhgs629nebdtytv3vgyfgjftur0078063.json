I had a very helpful facilitator who helped me with pre-trip information and documentation and answered every query and anxiety with the patience of Job. From the time the staff met me at Ushuaia, I felt I was in capable hands - the pre-embarkation day was well handled and information was clear and complete. Embarkation itself was hassle-free, the ship was perfect - small enough to facilitate both interaction and privacy without being overwhelming, comfortable with good amenities, and with staff who worked like a well-oiled machine and made our stay very pleasant indeed. The Expedition Team were AMAZING, ensuring we remained engaged during the sea days with a variety of lectures and interesting sessions on photography, wildlife, history and geology of the region, ensuring our safety during landings and excursions, helping us to truly enjoy our experience of this breathtaking part of the world. The Team Leader took advantage of the good weather to ensure we got to see and experience everything, so we felt our time maximised. The Captain and his crew did a stellar job and we felt very safe in their capable, veteran hands.\nSo glad to have experienced Antarctica this way - it only enhanced the experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:08:10.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

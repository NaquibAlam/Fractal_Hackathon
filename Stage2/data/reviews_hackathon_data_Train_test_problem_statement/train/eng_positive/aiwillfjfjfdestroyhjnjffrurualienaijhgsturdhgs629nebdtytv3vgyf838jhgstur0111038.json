Compared to some of the other sellers in the Amazon market place, I thought the service of Thrift Books was the best, so I deiced to start going straight to them when I'm looking for a used title.\nI've placed orders directly through them three or four times now, and every one of them has been an excellent experience. The shipping is fast and the condition of the books is always (at least) as advertised -- I've ordered first edition hardbacks of novels originally published decades ago (with a listed condition of just \"good\"), and they've shown up at my door with virgin spines, dust jackets completely unmarred, and pages that are crisp, clean, and seemingly untouched. They clearly have high standards for quality.\nTheir selection is very good, too. I can only think of one time I wasn't able to find a book on their site, and it's kind of an obscure title that's been out of print for a generation now, so I won't hold that against them!\nI honestly couldn't recommend them enough!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T07:32:16.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I got the E-Ticket email the same day. I didn't select any seats and we still got to sit together for most of the flights. All the flights were correctly booked for the round trip, not much more to ask for!\nThe only negative thing about my experience is the E-Ticket I was sent via email I was unable to use to check in online before I went to the airport. Once I was at the airport though I just showed the customer service agent the email I had and he was able to use it to print out my tickets for the trip there.\nI would definitely recommend using FlightHub and I will use again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:57:16.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

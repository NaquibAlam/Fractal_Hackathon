They were delivered by DHL on the Wednesday. I was well impressed with the superb delivery and easy order process. However when I checked the order, I thought that it had been packed incorrectly. Instead of 4 spark plugs in the pack I had received only 1 for £13.99!!! I had checked the order quantity and had believed that this would mean I would get 4 spark plugs. On phoning the customer service department of Euro car parts I was put through to Nathan who explained my error: the quantity fitted is not the same as the quantitiy delivered. I felt that the website was misleading and hadn't explained to a layperson like myself the actual quantities that were ordered. Nathan understood this perfectly and then arranged to have further spark plugs delivered to me for free delivery back to France plus a compensation gift!! I can't think of any other company that would offer such fantastic customer service. Thank you so much Nathan ( you deserve to go far -management please take note! ) and of course thanks to Eurocar parts.com. Bonne journée!

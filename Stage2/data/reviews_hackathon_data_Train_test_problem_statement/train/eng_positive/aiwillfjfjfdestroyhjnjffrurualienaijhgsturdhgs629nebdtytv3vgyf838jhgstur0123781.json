The range extension works amazing and is not overly large addition to the controller. The extra props and battery charger are spot on in whats needed and not over or under kill for the setup. Little things like the silicon cover for the controller and memory cards and cases for things and the solar filters are just the icing on the cake. The case is the best case Ive had so far. It fits everything and then some and it is rock solid in protecting your setup. The backpack they sent as an added bonus was well made although I have not used it the case is just the right size to be able to take everything with you so I use the hard case 100% of the time. Anyone looking to buy a new Phantom 4 setup I highly recommend this kit as you will probably spend more finding all of the parts included in it and will want them at some point anyhow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T04:22:51.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Missed not having a manual to assist with familiarising us with this new vehicle but not big issue. We needed to replace booster seat with child car seat and we had great assistance getting that sorted. On return of vehicle there was issue with us not having the 'checklist' which must have gone astray. The matter was dealt with so professionally that it was sorted in no time and no delay with our departure. We have been very impressed with the service.

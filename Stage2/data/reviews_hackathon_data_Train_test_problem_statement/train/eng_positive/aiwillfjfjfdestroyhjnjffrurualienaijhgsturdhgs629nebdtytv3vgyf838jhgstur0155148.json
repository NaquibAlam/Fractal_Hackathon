I enjoy the large selection and the low prices. It's also nice that orders over $10 ship for free. My only complaint is that my order get messed up, they managed to send me the wrong book completely. I contacted Customer Service and they responded fairly quickly and sent me the correct book. Overall, I would say shop with them again, but I might make several smaller orders instead of a large order to avoid potential mess ups.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:10:33.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

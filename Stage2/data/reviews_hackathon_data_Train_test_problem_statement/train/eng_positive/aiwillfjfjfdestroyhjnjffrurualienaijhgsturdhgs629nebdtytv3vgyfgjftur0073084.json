I myself have been in wow since the beginning but i don't have the time to raid so much now - but with wowvendor I can go through the important raids, make achievements where I'm heavily dependent on others. What makes this work is in my opinion the following:\n- Very good and strong web with all instance on all levels\n- Very good organization (fast feedback and perfect execution)\n- Really pro players (but no arrogance)\n- Helpfulness and politeness also when you ask questions or sometimes get lost in a raid\nI have used wowvendor and will continue to do that in order to continue enjoy the challenging raids combined with all the time i do quests i.e. on my own or with friends. Most importantly, I'm still in my guild (now for 10 years) with many friends. It's a very good combination", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T14:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T21:10:36.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

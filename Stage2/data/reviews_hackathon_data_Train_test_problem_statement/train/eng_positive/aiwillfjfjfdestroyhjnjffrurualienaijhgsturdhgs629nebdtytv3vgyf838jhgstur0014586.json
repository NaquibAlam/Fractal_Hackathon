The first 28 day order I had to call back twice for missing items and had received three separate shipments. The Second 28 day shipment w I had to call back once for missing items. The frozen foods was sent prior to the non-frozen items and I was missing items from the frozen shipment. Also I received the non-frozen items, which included the snacks was send 10 days apart. This caused me to pause the programs for several days causing a minor set back in my progress.\nAfter my initial review, NS customer service responded and suggested that I open a case so that they can review. After reviewing, the first part of my next shipment was not missing any items. I am still awaiting the second shipment to confirm that my entire order has no issues.

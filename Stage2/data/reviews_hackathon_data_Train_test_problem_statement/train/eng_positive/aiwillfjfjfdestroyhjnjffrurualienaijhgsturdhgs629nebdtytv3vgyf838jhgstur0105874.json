I couldnt remember where i had gotten the product that id recently purchased but knew Northshore carried it. I couldnt access the online site due to password issues so i called. The person i spoke to was helpful, polite, and i felt very comfortable with talking to her. She gave me the company's email to contact them about their defective product then sent me samples of a comparable product from Northshore. I received the product and thought it was a good quality and will most likely place an order. Well done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T03:28:01.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

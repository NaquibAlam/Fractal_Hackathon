The best part about this company is that the wig that I was to return they told me to keep it as long as I donated it to a cancer center so that is what I did . I had breast cancer 5 yrs ago so I called the Schiffler Cancer Center in Wheeling West Virginia and told them my story about Sherri Shepherd's wigs and they were very excited about the donation! So thank you Sherri Shepherd u r first class keep up the good work. God bless u and ur company", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T23:22:43.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

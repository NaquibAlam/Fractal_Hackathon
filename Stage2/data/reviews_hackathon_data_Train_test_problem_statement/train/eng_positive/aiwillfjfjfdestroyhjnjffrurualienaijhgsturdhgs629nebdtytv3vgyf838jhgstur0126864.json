The first visit opens up horizons to what you can do with your suit. You get educated with the different options from lapels to number of threads... man you'll become a suit expert with the consultation session. You also get style advice based on your fit and look preference. The experience was pleasantly surprising: I can describe it as 'truly owning the suit' because you know it up to the smallest detail!\nKudos Michele! I am very happy with my first Lanieri suit and I am excited for the next one!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:50:39.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

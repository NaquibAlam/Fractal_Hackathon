It saved us from home flood damage twice. $15,000 was my cost for the first flood in 2001 that convinced us we needed SOMETHING to give us peace of mind. I can't say enough GREAT things for this system and for the PROFESSIONAL customer service/technical assistance. It's a system that shuts off your water immediately after sensing water flow, NOT after water is all over your floors.\nI have recommended FloLogic to many many people that are also thankful for having this tremendous system. Call me anytime to discuss this product. Bill 727-743-5836.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T11:12:46.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

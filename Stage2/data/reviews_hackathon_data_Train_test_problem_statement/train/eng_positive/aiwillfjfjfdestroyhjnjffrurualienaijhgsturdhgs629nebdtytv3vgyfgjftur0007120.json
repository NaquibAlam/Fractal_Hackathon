The vehicle I found online was available, and Steve ensured I was comfortable without being overly pushy. He worked well with me on pricing and even offered some advice for how to sell my old vehicle. I had an issue with my car the day after purchase related to a software update, and Steve was able to help me get to the right people to get it fixed in a timely matter. I'd highly recommend Steve and the team at Auto Lenders to anyone looking for a high quality pre-owned vehicle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:38:16.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

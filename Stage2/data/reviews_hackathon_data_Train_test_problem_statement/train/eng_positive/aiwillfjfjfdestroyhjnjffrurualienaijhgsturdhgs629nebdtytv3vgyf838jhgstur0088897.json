The service I received from start to finish was the best I have ever had with a car hire company.\nOn arrival to collect my car the office was extremely busy but they didn't rush people, all the staff said hello to the people waiting and made sure that everything was discussed re the hire. The person I dealt with on collection was Daniel. On return we were handled by Rene who also took us to the airport.\nupon arrival in England I discovered that I had left an item in the car. I rang and asked for Rene who said that they had it there and he would post it himself the next morning before going to work. I have now received the said item and am very grateful to Rene and all the staff for their great customer service.

The team was friendly, professional, patient and the experience was relaxing and reassuring. This was very important to me as I was under a lot of pressure during the web construction. I was very particular about my site, and the team was very cooperative in dealing with my wishes. They continually kept me up to date through Basecamp and were available for phone calls when requested. I have just asked for site feedback from friends and clients, and the results are unanimous - the most frequent Quote: was \"beautiful\". As well, comments included clean, easy to read and navigate and several people asked for the name of the web builder which I was happy to provide. I will be building a second site and will certainly use BuildYourSite.com.

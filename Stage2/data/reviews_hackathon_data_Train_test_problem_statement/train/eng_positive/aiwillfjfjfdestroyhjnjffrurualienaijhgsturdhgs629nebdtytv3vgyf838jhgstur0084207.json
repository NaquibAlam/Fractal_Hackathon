Flawless customer service, tracking for every single box, quick responses to problem or questions. The food is great and high quality, meals are varied so you really have nice variety for the meals for each week, instead of the same thing over and over but with ricotta instead of mascapone and a slightly different pasta shape. Marley Spoon even sends surprises in the box like a really nice tote/shopping bag and a Martha Stewart really really nice wooden spoon a different week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T08:11:47.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

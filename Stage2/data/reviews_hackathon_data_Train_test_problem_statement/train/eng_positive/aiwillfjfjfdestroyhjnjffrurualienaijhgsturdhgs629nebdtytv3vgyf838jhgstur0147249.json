Prices through dealership were outrageous which led me to this site. 2 headphones for same price or less then dealership! placed order and received items within days! Super fast processing and delivery. Simple to use, opened box, put batteries in, selected proper channel on headphones to work with DVD system in truck and viola crisp clear sound from both headphones. Highly recommend these headphones for in car systems. thanks for great product and quick service and delivery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:34:57.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Our group of 6 included some who have traveled all over the world and they felt this was the most relaxing and interesting trip ever. We were met at the airport and guided through customs to our van. The excursions the next day to the Doka coffee plantation, the Poas Volcano and the Waterfall Park were a wonderful introduction to this beautiful and diverse country. Our guides on those excursions and those to Manuel Antonio National Park were very knowledgable and professional. Each and everyone went out of his or her way to provide us with the best experience. And that includes all the drivers as well. I could go on and on - suffice to say, we will be using Costa Rican Vacations again and I will be asking for Cindy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T23:01:30.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

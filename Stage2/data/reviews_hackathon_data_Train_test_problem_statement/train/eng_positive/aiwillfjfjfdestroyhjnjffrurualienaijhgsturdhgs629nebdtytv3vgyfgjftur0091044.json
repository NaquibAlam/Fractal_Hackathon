So, obviously, I was hesitant to order books from ThriftBooks.com initially. My first transaction was for $15 and I got five books.. talk about a steal! The first thing that impressed me was the \"go green\" options. I believe well-loved books are the best books and wasn't concerned with the quality, we long as it was \"acceptable\". After my confirmation email, I received TWO shipment emails a few hours later! Talk about prompt service!! I was thrilled. I tricked the books online for roughly a week and was thrilled when they arrived in great condition and eco friendly wrapping. I immediately took to Facebook to share this resource with my book-loving friends and they were as amazed as I was. Thank you for a reliable site with solid values, eco-conscious practices, and a plethora of titles. I couldn't be happier!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:15:58.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

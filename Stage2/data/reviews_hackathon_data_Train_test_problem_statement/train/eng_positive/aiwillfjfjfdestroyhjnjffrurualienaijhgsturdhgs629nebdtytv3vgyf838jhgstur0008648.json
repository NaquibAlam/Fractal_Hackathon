I have found every tour they recommend has been great and exactly what I would have picked had I made my own picking.\nOnly down side is they book the domestic and international flights separately thus that can be a hassle at the airport. Also, they have you confirm 24 hours in advance every tour/pick up you have -which for the longer trips gets a little excessive.

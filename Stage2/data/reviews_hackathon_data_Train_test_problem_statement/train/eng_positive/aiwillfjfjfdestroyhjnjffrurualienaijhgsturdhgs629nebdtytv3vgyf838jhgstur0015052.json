The price was the main key to getting our business. The order was delivered before we expected it. That was a pleasant surprise. If I had to complain about anything it would be the backing on the note pads. We expected it to be a little heavier (like light weight cardboard) rather than just a piece of construction paper. But, overall, we're happy with the order. We'll probably use them again in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:57:37.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

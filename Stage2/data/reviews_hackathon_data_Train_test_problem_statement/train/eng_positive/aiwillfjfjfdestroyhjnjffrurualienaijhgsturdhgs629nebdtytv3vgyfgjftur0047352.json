I spoke to the representative, stating what were must do items and no interest in items giving her a time table. We already had our airline ticket (flying points) and a cruise booked out of Sydney and had to fit our experiences into the time allotted. Our airport pick-ups were always on site, the hotels were good - just a note here would be to mention that the hotel in Port Douglas worked out great, but we were surprised that it was more of an apartment, than an actual hotel and the hotel on Hamilton Island was very nice, however a two level penthouse suite was definitely not a requirement by us and we were very surprised when we were shown the room. All tours were very enjoyable, pick-ups and directions were great. A mention to be made about the Whitehaven Beach Adventure - it is very rugged, no seating and hardly any shade for lunch. I left early to go back to Hamilton Island, my husband stayed for lunch and the snorkelling. I think that this tour is much more of a snorkelling tour than the write up leads you to believe. The 11 day bus trip was very enjoyable. We have always been apprehensive of bus tours, but enjoyed this one so much that we might even to another one in the future - probably Great Britain. The driver and guide were very informative and all the people on the tour seemed to get along really well - you could tell by the loud conversations at dinner. All our in country flights were booked and on time - little mix-up about the time of a pick-up in Port Douglas, but got it sorted out. As stated earlier, I would not hesitate to recommend this company to anyone going \"down-under\".\nJust a note regarding the long time to reply - we left the Goway itinerary in Sydney on January 31 and were on a 14 day cruise around New Zealand with 2 additional days in Auckland. We only got home today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:20:04.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

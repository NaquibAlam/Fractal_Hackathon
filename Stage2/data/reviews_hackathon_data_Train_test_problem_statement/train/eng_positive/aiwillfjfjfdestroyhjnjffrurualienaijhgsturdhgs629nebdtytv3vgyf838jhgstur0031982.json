Each print was different and required a different (and unique) mat color. I found exactly what I needed with the \"tangerine\" color for one of the prints. It was easier for me to pull the print up online and compare to the mat colors than to actually take the 16 x 24 print into a framing shop. I am very satisfied with Matboard and More. My only complaint is that shipping was a bit expensive and the company didn't offer any free shipping coupons, regardless of the order size. I hesitate to purchase online just because I hate adding $20 or more to my order just for shipping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T17:50:38.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

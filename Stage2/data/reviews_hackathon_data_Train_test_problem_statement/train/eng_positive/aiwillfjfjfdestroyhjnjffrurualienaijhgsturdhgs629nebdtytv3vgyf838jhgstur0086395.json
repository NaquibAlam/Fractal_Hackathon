They rang to inform me which garage would be collecting my car and also rang to inform me of what work needed doing to the car. The guy on the phone was incredibly helpful and understood I needed to keep costs down so informed me I what work needed doing immediately and what could wait a week or so.

My car was serviced and returned by 3pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:29:22.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

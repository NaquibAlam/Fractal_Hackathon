I have them all over my stomach, and on the tops sides and back of my thighs, and on the sides of my waste. I ordered Trilastin without much hope it would work. I've used for two months now, once per day not twice like it says to conserve product. My sagging skin on my stomach has noticeably diminished. Not completely, but it definitely has made a difference. All my stretch marks were already white, so I can't tell if the product has faded them at all. However they do seem less deep then before. None have gone away completely though. I am determined to keep using this product over the next few months to see continued improvement. This is not a quick fix product!!! However I do think it's making a difference which is more than I can say for any other product I've tried.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:44:12.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

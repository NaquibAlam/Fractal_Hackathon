(Only Portuguese is with Babbel)\nMy experience with languages is that it is hard to find good books for it, and now with advent of on-line learning tools, the situation is becoming even more difficult. Few books and tools are didactic enough, bring useful up to date vocabulary, introduce grammatical concepts seamlessly, have lectures short enough not to discourage you, and have exercises encouraging enough for you to want to do them.\nWell, Babbel is not one of those bad picks. It was very carefully done, the lectures have the right length, the exercises are stimulating, grammatical concepts are introduced gradually, seamlessly, and it is overall a pleasure to take each new lecture and exercises. Vocabulary is up to date, you will learn about computers, mobiles, social networks, things you really need.\nI think the app should be improved, two things in particular:\n1 - On the screen where all lectures are listed, it should be written which grammatical concept are introduced with it. For example, if I want to rehearse plural, I have no clue which lecture to pick. Sad :-(\n2 - The review program doesn't seem to be very smart. I have the impression I am always reviewing the same words, and always from the first few lectures. It doesn't seem to keep the score for each words, so those that I already know and always get right, come as frequently as those I have difficulty to grasp. It seems to be just recording the time since you last read or typed each word. That should be smarter, the program should know which words are tough for each user.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:01:41.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

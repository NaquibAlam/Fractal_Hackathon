My only issue is the sillicone beads are really loud when you shift under the blanket, kinda sucks when you're about to fall asleep. But the cloth is very soft and the weight is nice and comforting, I'd definitely recommend if the beads were less loud", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T08:27:14.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I narrowed the field down to two that seemed to provide what we need: an easy-to-use system that can \"work around\" our three large dogs while giving us peace of mind and round the clock monitoring. While I was online comparing, Courtney popped up at the GetSafe site and offered a chat. She was friendly, helpful, professional and made the interaction enjoyable. No \"sell,\" just working to understand our needs and and providing an explanation of the benefits of GetSafe. After speaking with her, I didn't bother to talk with the other wireless solution company. I called her a few days later and completed the transaction. I'll come back and review the equipment and service after we've had it for a while. But for now I am more than happy to recommend putting GetSafe on your short list if you're looking for a home security system. The customer service is excellent at the start!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:57:30.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

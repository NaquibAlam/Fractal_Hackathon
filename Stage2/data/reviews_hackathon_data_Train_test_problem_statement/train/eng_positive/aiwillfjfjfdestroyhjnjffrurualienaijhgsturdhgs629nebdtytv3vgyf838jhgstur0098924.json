The Mirror Company.com outdid everyone by FAR on price, and ultimately also on delivery & installation. The installers arrived easily within their window and made short work of installing a beautiful wall of mirrors in his little gym. There were NO extra or hidden charges, the guys were super polite and had fun watching my little Jack Russell growl and nip at himself in the finished mirrors. One of (if not the) best overall purchase, delivery and installation events I've had to date! I strongly recommend these guys, you won't be sorry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:08:56.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The website shows you real (magnified) photos, including a 360 view, of the sapphire, along with lots of information. The selection of sapphires as well as ring settings (different styles, metals) was impressive. Once we found a stone and setting we liked, we requested a free CAD rendering of the sapphire with the setting. Mary from NSC then worked with us to answer our questions, and adjust our design. We ended up ordering a ring made with the same sapphire but a slightly different setting that would stack better with a wedding band, and couldn't be happier with the results!\nHere's the gushing email I sent Mary after receiving my ring:\nI love the ring!! The sapphire is beautiful and so blue even under dim lighting, the diamond halo is pretty and sparkly, and the yellow gold gives everything such a nice, warm glow. It's perfect.\nWould definitely recommend NSC to anyone looking for a sapphire engagement ring. We had looked at some other other stores, including online retailers, but NSC offered the best stones AND price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T16:13:16.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

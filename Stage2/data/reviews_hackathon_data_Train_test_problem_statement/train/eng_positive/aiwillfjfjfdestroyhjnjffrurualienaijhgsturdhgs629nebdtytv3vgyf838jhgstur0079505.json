We got adopted by a silly cat and that created some deep thought on what to do with this cat for a couple of months. I didn't want to ask friends or family as they all have pets of their own. And more than a few days is a lot to ask of anyone. So I started looking on the internet and found TrustedHouseSitters. I have been very pleased with the experience and will use them every year and have told all my pet owner friends about them. Also, I might ad, that Leo the cat hates the vets and would not survive there, or maybe the vet wouldn't survive Leo. But, when we came home, he was healthy, happy and glad to see us. The house was clean, nothing amiss at all. Great service!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:59:56.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Service from this company is A1. Product was also excellent, except for a small defect and the fact they forgot to put the anti-reflection coating inside lenses.\nI contacted them and right away they arranged for me to send back for a replacement. OK, this is not perfect, but hey, stuff happens to everybody, so I excuse this as action is good and responsive. They paid the return postage and will send back new glasses. This just happened, so I am in the process and should receive them next week. If all is ok, you wont see any follow-up to this and I will maintain my 4 star going on 5! Recommende these guys.

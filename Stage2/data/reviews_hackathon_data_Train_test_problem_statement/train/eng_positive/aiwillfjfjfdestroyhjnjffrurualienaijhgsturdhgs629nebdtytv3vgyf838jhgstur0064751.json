I heard horrible stories of hosts and the organisation that comes along with it. Therefore, I was not sure if I should risk it. In the end I did and I am happy I did so. Although my life abroad will be from April - June 2017, the organisation itself was the easiest ever. I registered and texted a number of hosts. All of them replied the same day which was more than fantastic but also a bit sad because from the writing all of them appeared to be so lovely. In the end I decided to pick one, easy as that - no trouble, no doubt.\nI am really looking forward the host and will keep you updated by June if it was worth it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:16:21.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

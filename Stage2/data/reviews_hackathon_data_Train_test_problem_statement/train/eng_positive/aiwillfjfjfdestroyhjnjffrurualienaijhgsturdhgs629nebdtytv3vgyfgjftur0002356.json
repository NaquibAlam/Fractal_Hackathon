My neighbor had used mountain specialist Sara to book their previous trips and recommended I give her a call. Sara is wonderful! She listened to our situation (never seen snow, not comfortable driving in it, need a family oriented resort with nearby amenities) and recommended a beautiful resort that fits everything on our checklist. We are so excited and our boys check out the resort links she sent almost everyday. And now that we're booked, she's helping us with all the fun necessities we will need /want on our vacation. (Lift tickets, equipment rentals, lessons etc.). We're looking forward to a wonderful vacation!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:01:25.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

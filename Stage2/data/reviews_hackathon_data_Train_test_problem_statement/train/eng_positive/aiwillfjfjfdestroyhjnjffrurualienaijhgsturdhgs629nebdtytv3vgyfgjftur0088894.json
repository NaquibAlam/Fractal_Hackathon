I was pleased with the books, although I would say the black and white photos came out too dark so not true to life as the actual photos. (I have had some issue with their back and white photos in the past too, they just never seem the correct colour). Most of my photos were taken on a DSLR in good lighting and some even brightened during editing but still some of the photos came out slightly too dark in the photo book which is a slight shame. However, since these were not for professional use I wasn't too worried.\nThe 6x4 book is a soft back and all the pages including cover and the back are a thick card rather than photograph paper, which gives the books a durable feel. I loved the books; however, because of the card used I think this reduces the quality of the photos so would really like to see an option on their website to be able to reorder the books in additional sizes because I would definitely reorder in a larger size. The only other issue I had was the barcode placed on the back of the cover of the book which doesn't show up during preview. I don't know why this is needed and looks unsightly. Overall, for the price of these books and the fair quality I am very pleased and would definitely reorder more.\nMy order was delivered in 6 days so a very smooth transaction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:22:33.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

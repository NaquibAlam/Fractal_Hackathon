They graciously offered a replacement or better yet - full credit to an upgraded mattress. This also involved a difficult delivery to our house which is in a rural mountainous area of Colorado. New mattress, another delivery and we are sleeping in great comfort. Innomax couldn't have been more helpful and showed us how well they treat their customers. We highly recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:24:36.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

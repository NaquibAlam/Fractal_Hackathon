I only wanted to recoup my money not make a profit and was a little worried at first when ticket master added their commission on top of my asking price as I thought the tickets wouldn't sell.\nPleasantly surprised at the speed of sale. My tickets sold in three days. Just goes to show there are definitely people using the site to purchase.\nOnly afterwards did I realise that you don't get paid until after the event has happened which for me was 2 and a half months. I get it if it's physical tickets. The buyer needs to be protected in case you don't hand the tickets over or something dodgy happens when they try use the tickets at the gate.\nMy tickets were e tickets that were verified by ticketmaster as they were listed. I didn't have to do any handover ticket master just reissued the tickets in the buyers name. In this case there is no risk so I don't understand why I had to wait.\nThat being said I did receive the money 5 days after the event without any issue.

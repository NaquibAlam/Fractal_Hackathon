Within an hour of placing my order, I received an email advising that one of the items was unavailable due to a manufacturers supply problem. During an exchange of emails, several alternatives were offered and discussed and eventually a substitution was made and the order completed. The quick response from Mikes meant that I lost no time in having my order delivered and still managed to buy everything I needed.\nGood service as always.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:21:13.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They didn't force me to purchase the entire assembly containing the part I needed.\nThe only reason it is not a 5 star is that the shipping was pretty much a flat amount regardless of the piece purchased. The part i needed was less than $2 but ended up costing me $11 or so with the shipping. In the end, still not a bad deal since other sites weren't even allowing me to get the individual part (>$100 for the entire assembly on some sites), but it would have been nice for the $2 part to have lower shipping.\nI'd still recommend Vacuum-Direct to anyone in need of quality vacuum parts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T15:04:59.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

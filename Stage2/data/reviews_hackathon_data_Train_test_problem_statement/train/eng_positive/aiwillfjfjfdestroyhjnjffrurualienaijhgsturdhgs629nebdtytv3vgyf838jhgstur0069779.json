I rang on the Tuesday morning and spoke to Natalie who arranged a free returns label for me to return the item for testing. She received this on the Wednesday and after testing it, dispatched a replacement to me on the Thursday. I would have received this on the Friday if DPD hadn't failed to deliver the parcel on time, which Natalie chased up for me. She kept me up to date at every stage via email and was pleasant and professional. I would recommend Currentbody to anyone and would like to thank Natalie who is brilliant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T06:50:27.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I used to cook quite a bit - some meals more elaborate than others, but my husband is now disabled and I was looking for good and healthy food, easy prep and something delivered to me that wasn't pizza or mediocre Chinese food.\nEvery box I've received has been correctly packed. Every menu I've cooked has been very good to excellent. The instructions are easy to follow and are offered in order so that things end up prepared and ready to serve at the same time. The meal selections cover a range of meats and vegetables and the portions are perfect. Sometimes I have leftovers too.\nI like that I can choose the 3 meals out of six or seven for the week in advance.\nMy only hesitation in giving 5 stars is that some meals are better than others in terms of depth of flavor. A few of the preparations didn't result in full flavored food. In some cases, that's because they limit the fat content - which is a good thing. In others, the method of preparation doesn't work for me. But that's a personal complaint and shouldn't stop anyone from trying their meals. As I get more experience with them, I will add my own spices to meet my preferences.\nI'd give them 4.8 stars if I could.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:55:25.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Her college education, perfect English, sensitive awareness of the group, and total forthright honesty made this tour the cruise highlight. She even took us to the Batu caves when hundreds of locals were having a huge pilgrimage and keeping track of us alone was challenging. All 6 of us learned much and appreciated her energy and knowledge . Great tour!\nJulie, USA\nFeb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T15:45:30.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

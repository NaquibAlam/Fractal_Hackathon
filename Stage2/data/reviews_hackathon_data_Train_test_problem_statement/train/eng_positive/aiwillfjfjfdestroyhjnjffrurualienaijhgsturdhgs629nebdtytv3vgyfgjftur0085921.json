Through their excellent web site service we have been able to secure some wonderful house sit opportunities. The website is easy to navigate and very informative. Daily email alerts help us to respond quickly to house sits that may be of interest. The staff in the Help Center are very helpful and responsive. What more could one want? We highly recommend a subscription to trusted house sitters. Either as house sitters, as house owners or both.

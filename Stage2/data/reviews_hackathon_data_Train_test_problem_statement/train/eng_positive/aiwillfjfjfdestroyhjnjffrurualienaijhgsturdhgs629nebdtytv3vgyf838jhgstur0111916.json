As a classroom teacher, it's tough to fill my classroom with engaging books for my students while on a budget. ThriftBooks helps me get these books my students love at a price that won't make me have to take up a second job! :)\nMy only two \"wishes\" are:\n1. a more detailed tracking method for packages. I would love to have an \"anticipated date of delivery\" for the books I order.\n2. The coupons for reaching Reading Rewards had a longer time to be used. If I order books to meet my Reading Rewards, I have to place another order by the end of the next day to use the coupon. If I make an order, chances are I won't be placing another order until the following week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:39:38.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I would make payments and then stop. Make more payments and stop. I have been divorced for 23 years and lived on my own. I raised 2 daughters with no child support. While I was raising them, I got child credit and I also received most my taxes back in a refund but once they were grown and out on their own, I did not have any tax breaks. Anyway, I received a call from Omni and we were talking about my options and I was then turned over to Janet Mould. Best thing that could ever happen. She was so helpful along with her team and worked diligently with the IRS and with me. I paid what I needed to pay, then paid the IRS what I was asked to pay and once I Pay the remaining balance to the IRS I will be free of this obligation that has been riding my back for years. I would recommend Omni to ANYONE I knew that needed this help. Wonderful company to work with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T18:39:48.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

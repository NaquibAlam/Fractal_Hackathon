My only issue was making sure I had the correct length of cable, there is not much variance once you've installed the ends and start to tighten it up so make sure you triple check the length. My client was very happy with the end product and the install was pretty simple as long as you take your time and think about very move...so many potential misses if you don't think first! Overall I would purchase this product again, it turned out great!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T13:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T14:48:21.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

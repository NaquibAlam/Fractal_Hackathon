George picked 5 places for my family (my husband and me and three kids -- 17, 15, 12) to visit -- all incredibly distinct and special. During the planning process we had many talks about what kinds of things my family would love and he totally got us. Each stop offered something incredible and at the end of our journey, we couldn't decide on a favorite hotel or experience. It was all fabulous. The logistics were also without a hitch as all transfers were perfect. We were taken care of from the minute we arrived until the minute we left. I can't say enough about Jacada and their services. They gave us a trip of a lifetime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:11:30.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

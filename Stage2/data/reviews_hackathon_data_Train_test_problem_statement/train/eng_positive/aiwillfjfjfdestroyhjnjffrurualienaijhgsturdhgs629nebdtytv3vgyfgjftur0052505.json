I am using Babbel with Duolingo, but I actually prefer Babbel for Russian. I felt Babbel did a better job in helping understand the Cyrillic alphabet sounds and integrating explanations into the lessons. I look forward to my lessons because they are fun! I especially love the conversations at the end of each lesson. They are sometimes funny stories but they actually show the vocabulary being used in CONVERSATIONS which is SO useful!! There are different voices on the recordings so it's helpful to hear words spoken by different people. Thank you Babbel!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T17:54:25.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

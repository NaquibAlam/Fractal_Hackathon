The only thing I didn't see coming was the Manulife insurance somehow got tacked on - not by me purposefully. But I immediately contacted Flight Hub and the lady there helped me successfully refund the accidental insurance purchase in 5-10 minutes. So overall a good experience and I will use the service again in future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:29:43.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

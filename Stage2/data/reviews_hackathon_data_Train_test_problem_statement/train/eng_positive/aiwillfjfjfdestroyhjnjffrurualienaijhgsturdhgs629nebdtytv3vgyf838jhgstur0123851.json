I recommend the site to any Canadians looking for designer goods before they check out traditional high-end websites based in the US or Europe. It's a fresh, edgy, and non-intimidating option for finding classic and current luxury items. They're well-stocked with familiar big names, but offer products from great independent designers too. My deliveries always arrive quicker than expected and whenever I've had to make a return, the process is pretty seamless. They also have AMAZING sales.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T07:54:05.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

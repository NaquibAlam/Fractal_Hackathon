Simple as that. I've never had an issue with them, they always send polite, friendly (and frankly quite amusing) emails letting me know that my order has been accepted/delivered/etc. They use third party companies for delivery, but I've never had an issue with something I've ordered being late. I've used them multiple times, most recently to get Pokemon Moon and Metal Gear Solid V. The games at gameseek are typically slightly cheaper than somewhere like Game, which is always nice.

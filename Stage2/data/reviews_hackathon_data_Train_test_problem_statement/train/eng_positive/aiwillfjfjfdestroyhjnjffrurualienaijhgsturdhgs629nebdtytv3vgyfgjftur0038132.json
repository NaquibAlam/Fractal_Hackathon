I purchased a C10 40-20-40 Lowback leather seat some time back in November 2016 for a 92 Ford F250 replacing a factory bench seat. The item was purchased with a quick build and arrived here in Plymouth MA in a timely fashion. However the mounting brackets did not fit the factory floor pan, this is when my customer service nightmare began. Out of the countless telephone calls, taking video tapes, sending emails, links, and endless minutes spent on hold with some of these people John J., Ben and/or Alec, Alex, THEN I FINALLY GOT FERNANDO REYES, who miraculously got me to Rick in December 2016 who made the determination the seat does not fit my model vehicle and my resolve would be to return and replace the custom seat ordered with a new model that fits the vehicle. We initiated this and unfortunately the order did not go through correctly. Now here I am on January 29, 2017 working again with customer service representative FERNANDO REYES who recalled our conversation and stayed on the phone with me to resolve this completely. Every time I thanked him for assisting me with this nightmare he replied with a thank you Sir and very humbly said \"I AM ONLY DOING MY JOB\" and because of the customer service I have received from this man on 2 separate occasions, I am giving FERNANDO REYES a 5 star rating. To whom it may concern, this man should be commended for his dedication to providing excellent customer service and the manner for which he represents your company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:28:01.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

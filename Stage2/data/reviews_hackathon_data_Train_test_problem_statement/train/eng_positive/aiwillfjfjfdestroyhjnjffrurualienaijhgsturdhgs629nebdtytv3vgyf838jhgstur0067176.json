Trusted Housesitters helped the Ridleys find me.\nEvery minute of my time with Miss Ellie was wonderful. Except for the few days when it rained, we went to the park and played ball. Everywhere I went, she came this me. If there was a pub or tea room that didn't allow her, I didn't go. We had a fantastic time; she even helped me take care of the tomatoes. When her parents (the Ridleys) came home they seemed quite pleased with Ellie's behaviour; she was happy to see them, but not desperate as if she had be pining the entire time. They even said Ellie acted like she would have been happy to stay with me. That is a huge compliment. And it is very gratifying that they enjoyed the daily emails. I try to make them informative and entertaining and include photos from that day. It's part of why I love pet sitting!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T13:07:26.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

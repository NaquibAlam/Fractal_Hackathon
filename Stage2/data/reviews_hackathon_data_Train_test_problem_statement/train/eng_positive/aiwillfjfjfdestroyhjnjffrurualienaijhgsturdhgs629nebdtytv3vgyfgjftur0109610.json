The drive into the are of the storage space was very unlevel; a bit scary when I saw my moving truck sway from side to side as they drove to the storage space. The Storage Mart Rep advised me they were going to do new paving this summer to alleviate the issue but it didn't ease my present state of mind. I was lucky that the movers had things tied down to prevent things shifting much. The price was reasonable compared to another site that was off the main highway.

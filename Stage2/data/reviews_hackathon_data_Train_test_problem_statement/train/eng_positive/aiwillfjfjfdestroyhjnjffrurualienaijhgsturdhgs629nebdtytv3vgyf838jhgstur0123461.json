It is difficult to assess quality at this time. The 2 young men sent to install them were very nice; however, they mis-measured and ended up having to cut the mirrors more than once, and making them shorter due to the error. They also arrived and hour and half prior to time given us (they arrived at 10:30 vs. 12-4 frame given us), which was problematic. So far quality seems good but time will tell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:07:36.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

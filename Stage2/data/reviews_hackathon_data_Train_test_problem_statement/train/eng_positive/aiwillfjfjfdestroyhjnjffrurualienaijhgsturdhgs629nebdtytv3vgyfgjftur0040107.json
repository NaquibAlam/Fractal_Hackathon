It was my first time using them and will use them again for future projects that I am hired for. Peter was very helpful and got back to me with answers to my questions, made adjustments to my order as needed without any hassle. All communication was either by email or phone and was done quickly, which is important to me as a building professional. My order showed up in tact as agreed. There was a bit of confusion with the freight company but it all worked out. Again, I will definitely use them again.\nThank you for your help Peter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T20:32:22.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

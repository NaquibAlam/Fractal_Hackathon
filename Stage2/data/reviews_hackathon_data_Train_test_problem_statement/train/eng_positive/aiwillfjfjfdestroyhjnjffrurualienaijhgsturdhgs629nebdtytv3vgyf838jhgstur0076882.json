Big name vendors are double the price AND they are trying to make it harder to use 'compatible' cartridges. The only constructive criticism I would make is for them to ensure that all Ink Station cartridges are filled to the top. Which means when filling them they should ensure that the interior sponge gets a big drink as well before sealing. I only experienced this once so that is why all up I vote 5 stars. Keep up the great work. I hope your working conditions are better than that of Amazon's.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T21:26:45.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

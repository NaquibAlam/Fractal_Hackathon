I told him I would research the website a little more and get back to him. I called him back about 5 minutes later ready to make a purchase on some recliners we were talking about. he informed me of another brand that may interest me. I thought he was just trying to upsell me more expensive chairs. well I turns out these we actually a little cheaper and better quality of leather and had more features than the ones I was going to purchase. I made the purchase over the phone and Alex said the they would ship out Monday morning and he said they should arrive by superbowl but no promise. I said it did not matter. he said the delivery company would contact me and set up a delivery date and time. Tuesday afternoon about 1 pm I received a call from a delivery guy who said he had a delivery for me and I meet him at my house a out 10 mins later\nto my surprise my recliners already arrived. I was shocked and actually called Alex to inform him that they arrived already. he was also surprised but happy they got there for me. I love the chairs they are the Seacrest Sonoma model in black. very comfortable. thank you for the advise and a wonderful experience", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:08:59.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

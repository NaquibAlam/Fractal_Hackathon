It took a while but we finally decided to place our own order. We ordered various sauced and unsauced ribs and received country ham slices and bacon free! We have only tried the country ham slices thus far and loved them. This was our first time having country ham and I was a bit worried having never tried it and heard it is different from city ham. We were NOT disappointed and will definitely order more!

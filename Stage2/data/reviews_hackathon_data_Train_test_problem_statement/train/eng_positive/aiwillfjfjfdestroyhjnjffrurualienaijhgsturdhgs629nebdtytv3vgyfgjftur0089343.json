We were looking for a affordable, safe, clean, and easy access place.\nWe met face to face with a woman in the office, she took the time to walk us through everything about the storage process, she showed us the different size storage units, the secure-security access, the promotional discounts, and she even took the time to show us the affordable secure locks for the storage unit.\nWhat we loved about the storage unit, was that the units are like having a garage, you drive right up to it.\nIt's under 24 hour security.\nThe excellent customer service.\nIf you choose Guardian Self Storage, you'll be very happy you did.\nThank you Judy, good businesses like yours are hard to come by.\n- Mrs. Ricci", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T18:27:09.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

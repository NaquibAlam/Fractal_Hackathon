There's been a couple of glitches where my Data didn't seem to be working but once I was in a different area, all was fine. This has happened on a couple of occasions. But other than that everything has been good. I've had a couple of dropped calls but was it TPO or was it the other parties carrier? For what I use the service for, it suits me just fine. Can't beat the price and the 50% off the first month bill (promo), what a deal. I recommended this service to a friend and he got 75% off the first month bill as part of their Christmas promo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:01:29.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

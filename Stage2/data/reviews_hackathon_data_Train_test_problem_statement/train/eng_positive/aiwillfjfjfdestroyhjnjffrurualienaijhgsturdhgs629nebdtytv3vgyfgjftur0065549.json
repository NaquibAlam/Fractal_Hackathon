We accepted it was a bit of a risk choosing furniture we had not actually seen, but we are delighted with our purchases. The table is beautiful and we are also very pleased with the chairs - a lovely colour and shape. We obviously cannot tell how well they will wear and stand up to usage, but our initial impressions are very favourable. The only hiccup we had was that the table legs were not delivered with the rest of the packages by the courier, and we had to ring to chase these up. However, this was quickly resolved by Hallowood, the legs were found in the courier's warehouse, put on overnight delivery and we received them the next day. The table is very substantial and heavy but was easy to assemble. The only issue is that the Allen keys provided are not strong enough and we used our own tools, so be prepared for this. Overall, we are extremely happy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:34:00.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I am so pleased with the staff and doctors. I used to bring my dog to the Jackson location and I go to the Lakewood location because it is closer. But both facilities are wonderful. Every time I walk in, they always have a smiling face and always know my dog by her first name. They give her the attention, but love and medical. Hr doctors are always ready to go above and beyond to locate any problems and they want to help without breaking the bank. My dog has been having skin issues and we have been back and forth.. and after two days of visiting the doctor called me to make sure my dog was doing OK. That is why I love OCVH. The care and love for animals is seen all the time. They do a wonderful job!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:36:32.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We got very reliable and honest advice and opinions on how to best present the house and market it to prospective buyers. Janine coordinated the tradespeople, i.e., furniture rental, handyman, gardener and painters. With Janine, she guides you on what needs to get done and after decisions are made, she organised and checks the progress of each job. Janine updated us after each OFI and we were kept abreast throughout the process. Four days before the auction, we sat down with her and her colleague, auctioneer Tom Roberts, and we had a run through of the different scenarios that may play out on auction day. At this point, we were even more relaxed about selling our first house. On the day of the auction, we were not at all anxious. We even felt that selling houses seem to be very easy. We believe it is because Janine was very thorough. Oh, and more importantly, we got an excellent result! Thank you, Janine!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T18:46:03.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

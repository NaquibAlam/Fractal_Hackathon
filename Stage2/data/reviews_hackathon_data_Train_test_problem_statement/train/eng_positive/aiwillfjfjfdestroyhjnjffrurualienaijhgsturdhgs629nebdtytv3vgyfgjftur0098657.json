The phone had a balance due with Sprint, but iPhoneIMEI.net came through and the unlock worked just fine to use the phone with AT&T. Literally I have no complaints, it worked just like they said it would, and I saved myself form being scammed by someone on Craigslist. Makes sure you select the right type of unlock!!! I see people complaining that they had to pay extra, or think they're being scammed, no people -- check the IMEI with the $3 premium service to make sure you're selecting the right unlock! It will save you a headache, and you know you're getting the right unlocking service...it's 3 bucks for peace of mind, just do it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:58:54.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

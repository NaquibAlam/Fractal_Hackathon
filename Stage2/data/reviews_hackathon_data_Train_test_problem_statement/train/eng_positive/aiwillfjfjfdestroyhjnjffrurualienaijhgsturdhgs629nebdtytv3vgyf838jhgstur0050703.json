Luckily for me I made a decision early in my career to use Blacknight as my domain/hosting provider.\nIve had many clients use many different providers over the years which has left me pulling most of my hair out over lack of support or issues with the most simplest of tasks.\nNowadays I insist my clients move to Blacknight or I drop them as clients. Sometimes it's easier to choose peace of mind over a project.\nBlacknight have always assisted me in a polite, informative & timely manner. Their support helped me grow my business from strength to strength over the years. Nowadays I rarely contact Blacknight because I simply don't have to. If there's a network issue I get the info from their tech blog, otherwise it just works allowing me to focus on what is important to my business and my clients.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:13:10.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They mix and match airlines to find you the best flights for the best prices under one reservation while they handle all the separate bookings with the individual airlines behind the scenes. In addition all prices are displayed up front, with no surprised after you make your flight selections. And on top of all that, they often throw in a daily discount, which is an added bonus. I've used Flight Hub on several occasions and have always had a excellent experience. 5 Stars for sure!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:10:00.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

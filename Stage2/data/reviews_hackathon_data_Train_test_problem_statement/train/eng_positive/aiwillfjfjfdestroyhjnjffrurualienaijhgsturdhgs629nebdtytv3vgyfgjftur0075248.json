To be able to get within a few feet of the wildlife was just awesome. The scenery is stunning too and to be able to hike the last few miles of the Shackleton walk is something I'm proud to have completed. You have plenty of time ashore to take in the wildlife and scenery and we were very lucky with the weather to allow for this. The ship and expedition team were fabulous, especially Jonathon our team leader, who changed the itinerary around to avoid the weather; he was brilliant and I really appreciate the hard work behind the scenes that he did. There is plenty to do on the sea days as well with various lecturers during the day so you'll never be bored. The food and staff onboard ship were great and you'll never be hungry. A truly awesome trip and one that you must put on your bucket list if you love wildlife and scenery. Thank you to all the crew and expedition team onboard the 'Sea Spirit' for a once in a lifetime trip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:49:12.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It needs to be updated and they have a water leakage problem with the tub in the master bedroom. The floor in the master has a hole under the carpet and it feels as if you could step through it. I imagine there is also a mold problem because of the water, although we didn't see any. They didn't supply dish detergent or any cleaning supplies. This made it difficult to clean up the kitchen. They also listed unlimited long distance and the phone was disconnected. Not a problem since we have cell phones but it was something they made a big deal about in the advertisement. The upstairs loft stayed very hot. The location is great. Its only about 3 miles outside of Gatlinburg and there is a nice grocery store about a 1/2 mile away, as well as, several restaurants if you wanted to avoid the hustle and bustle of downtown. I liked that it was key coded and didn't require going to a rental office to check in and out. Overall the property was nice and convenient.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:51:02.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

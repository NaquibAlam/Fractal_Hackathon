It is perfect! I have worn it every day since it arrived and no other lipstick interests me now. If feels right, it looks amazing, I love it.\nI also got a lining pencil, Fixit, and Lip Glow (Pink). All perfect. I expect that the samples (I had dithered among four colors, they sent me samples of those four!) are perfect, too, but I've been busy trying to decide which foundation I should get... I think I'll go with Diorskin Star.\nI will never buy any other brand of lipstick. After my next purchase, I hope to say the same about foundation!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:07:17.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I can say, with no reservation that Premium mortgage and specifically, Joel Mahakian as mortgage loan officer is the BEST there is in Buffalo. The mortgage is done correctly from the start, there is no chasing documents with long delays, and the whole process is logical, streamlined and genuinely pleasant for all involved. Joel is an absolute expert at his job, and Premium gives him the tools and structure to do a great job. I will never stray from recommending Joel and Premium.

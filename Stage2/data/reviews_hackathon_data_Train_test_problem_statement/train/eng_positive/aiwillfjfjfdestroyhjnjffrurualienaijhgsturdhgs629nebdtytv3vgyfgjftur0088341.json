I find the book very enlightening especially its scientific approach to dealing with the diet regimen and its benefits.\nI especially liked the low carb and high fat combination for diet control. The 3 pound rule and the workout to avoid weight regain is another thing I loved about the book.\nIt is easier to lose all the benefits of this regimen if one does not follow up on it. All the other related topics on health like nutrients, water, metabolism, workouts, will power etc are really insightful and informative.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T12:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:03:00.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I used to buy my products off Amazon/eBay and actually received knock offs a few times so I decided to change my supplier. I heard of allbeauty from a friend who said they were really reliable and this has turned out to be very true. All the products arrive beautifully packaged and earlier than expected every time. The Clarins products I buy are genuine and well priced. They are great and will continue to use them!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T02:47:47.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

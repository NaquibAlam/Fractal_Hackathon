I did my research, probably more than was needed, and looked into Luxy extensively both on their website, 3rd party reviews and also on social media.\nLet me just say that they didn't disappoint! I received excellent service from start to finish. They helped me color match, since my hair is fairly two-toned, assisting me every step of the way. Their video tutorials are SUPER helpful for a girl who is not super hair savvy and is truly a tomboy at heart.\nThe quality is above and beyond what I expected, the color and texture blended seamlessly with my blown out hair and they held curls perfectly and didn't slip even once when I was wearing them for 10+ hours! No one I came into contact had even a clue that I was wearing extensions until I told them, and even then they had a hard time believing it!\nIf the team at Luxy can make a tomboy like me feel glamorous and knowledgeable when it comes to hair extensions (they are ridiculously easy and quick to put in), then the sky is the limit with what they can accomplish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T17:49:58.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

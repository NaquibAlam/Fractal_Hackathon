My Grandma had given me a down duvet as a 4yr old that was there for me, keeping me warm and comfortable, right through till my marriage and the need for a bigger one! I am sure the lovely duck down 4 seasons duvet we have now invested in for our daughter will do the same. Thank you very much for staying in New Zealand and providing such a great quality product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T15:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:19:08.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have always received my order within two days. I feel very comfortable with using their products as I know they are tested and pure. LiftMode takes the time to include bio-analysis with each product as well as a measuring spoon for proper dosage. They also provide excellent information on their website to learn about their products and how to \"stack\" them for better results. Thanks to LiftMode I have been able to stop taking anxiety medication and get a good night's sleep. I think they operate an excellent business and set the standard of how supplement companies should do business. They are the best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:18:53.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

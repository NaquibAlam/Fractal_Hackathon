I purchased a helmet that was on special and was very excited, however the small size was just a little bit too small. I really wanted this helmet, and took a chance on buying that size based on the measurements from my other helmet. Well the 2 CM variance was too much. I reluctantly sent it back and ordered another brand. Well, I rec'd my credit quickly and am happy with my new helmet. The peace of mind knowing their LL Bean-esque return policy will keep me coming back time and time again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T13:34:59.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

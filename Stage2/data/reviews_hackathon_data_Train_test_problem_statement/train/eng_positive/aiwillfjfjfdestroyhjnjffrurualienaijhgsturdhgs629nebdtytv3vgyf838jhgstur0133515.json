I received a partially rotten onion and sometimes a potato can arrive mushy. On the other hand, I eat produce such as parsnips and brussel sprouts that I would never buy! The creative recipes transform less than tasty vegetables into sweet mouth watering treats. Overall, the meal plan is a blessing for my household. No longer do I have to wonder what to cook from day to day. I do not have to grocery shop and my growing teenage boy is delighted to eat dinner again. He even cooked a couple meals and his friends did not believe he cooked it when he texted a pic of the finished meal. Life is good again, because of HelloFresh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:45:08.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

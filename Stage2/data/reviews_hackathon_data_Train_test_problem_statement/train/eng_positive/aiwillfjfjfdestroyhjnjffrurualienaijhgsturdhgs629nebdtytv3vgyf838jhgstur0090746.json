I have spent and wasted hundreds of dollars on local eye-wear shops. My prescription (near-sighted) requires some rather thick lenses and is rather tough to find a comfortable/designer frame, that doesn't look like \"coke bottle\" glasses. My local shop(s) were selling me lenses that were extremely, thick and had no integrity to advise me on high index material or what style is suitable for my face.\nThe glasses I purchased had a very distinct Anti-glare coating which can be easily be seen, over what other companies were offering. The lenses were accurate (correct prescription) and importantly light weight (high index material.) The frames were DGKY and did require some final frame adjustment for a perfect fit, but overall were very nice. I was assigned a customer service agent automatically to advise me and walk me though the procedure, which was nice. In my final conclusion, my purchase using Framesdirect (online) was very satisfying and I will use their services again for all my future sunglasses and prescription eye-wear. Contrary to popular belief, I was able to purchase a good set of glasses without problem using an online eye-wear service.

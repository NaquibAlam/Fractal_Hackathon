Whilst I have been hesitant in the past, I am now feeling more comfortable. The prices are better than one can get over the internet, or within the carriers websites.\nBecause of the penalties to change or cancel it is imperative that one checks the itinerary in detail before hitting the accept button. I failed to do this once and I only have myself to blame. Our contact, Kate, has always been transparent and careful to explain all the details, my advice is listen to your contact to ensure that you get what you are looking for. Keep in mind this is about getting a cheaper business class airfare and therefore the route may not necessarily be what you expect. I believe that AFG provide a great service at a very good price.

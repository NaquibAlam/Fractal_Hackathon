We are in our 8th week of receiving 3 meals a week and have not had a duplicate yet. Several of the meals we have thought were as good as what we would have expected eating out a nice restaurant. Ordering is simple, deliveries come on time, and there are always follow-up requests for feedback. We have had minor packaging issues, where the cryovacced protein packages have leaked a little due to the weigh of the ice slab laying directly on them, but they have credited us for any issues without hesitation. They have not changed the packaging to prevent this, which is the only reason I didn't rate them a 5. I would definitely recommend this as a time-saver and to get out of the rut of the same things for dinner all the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:44:26.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

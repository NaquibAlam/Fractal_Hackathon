I would recommend this PS location for anyone needing storage space in Surprise AZ.\nI was more than willing to place my review on Yelp, but found out I had to register for a Facebook account and I do not subscribe to that service or any other online app.\nPlease feel free to use my review in your marketing efforts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:06:16.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

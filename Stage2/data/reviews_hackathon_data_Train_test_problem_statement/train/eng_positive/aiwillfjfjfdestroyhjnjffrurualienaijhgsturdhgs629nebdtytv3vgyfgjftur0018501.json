The order process was very straight forward and easy to understand and follow. Sarah, an Optician in customer service followed my order every step of the way. I qualified for a very good discount on the lenses bringing the total cost far below what any other company was offering. The frames and lenses I chose are a very difficult to execute properly and Frames Direct did it flawlessly and in a timely manner. My experience was so good I just placed an order for RX sunglasses and I can hardly wait to get them. I highly recommend Frames Direct for prescription eyeglasses and sun glasses. Just follow the directions properly and they do the rest !\nMark Hadley\nMarion, MA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:39:59.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

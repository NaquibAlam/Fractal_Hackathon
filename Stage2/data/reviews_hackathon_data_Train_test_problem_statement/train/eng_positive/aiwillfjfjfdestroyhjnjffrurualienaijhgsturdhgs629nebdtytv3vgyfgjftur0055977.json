We are thrilled with the results beyond measure. The artwork and frame are beautiful, and when we press the remote, our TV is revealed for our viewing pleasure. When finished, TV disappears, and we enjoy beautiful artwork. The entire order process was joyful due to the outstanding customer service and knowledge of the employees. This purchase was money well spent. We could not be more thrilled with this investment!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:31:11.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

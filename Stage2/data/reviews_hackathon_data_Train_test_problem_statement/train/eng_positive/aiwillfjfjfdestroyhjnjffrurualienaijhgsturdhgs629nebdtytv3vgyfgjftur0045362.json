I made a furniture order on a Saturday Evening.1/28/17 I did not receive an order confirmation or an email but found out that the impending charge was already on my account. I did not know at the time the Company was not in Elizabeth New Jersey,though they do have a distribution center there,you can not talk to them. I called the only number, I could, got Kevin Robinson UK on the case.After several phone calls from Kevin Robinson in the UK and many emails the situation was resolved this morning 1/30/17.Kevin Robinson really had no exact reason why that Saturday Evening Purchase was not in the system immediately but believe me for people ordering on a Saturday Night this will get fixed. My order is to arrive no later than February 26th. Again do not be fearful of this company as they are very concerned over their customers. Any issue at all call and ask for Kevin Robinson. I will let everyone know when the furniture arrives.\nThe best to all future customers.\nVicki Youngelman", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:45:21.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

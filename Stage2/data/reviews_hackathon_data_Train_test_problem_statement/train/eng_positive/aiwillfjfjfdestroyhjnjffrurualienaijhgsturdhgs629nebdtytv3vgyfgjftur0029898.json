My experience with FD was kind of wonky. I ordered a pair of Persol frames right around the holidays. Everything seemed to be going well and I expected to receive my glasses within the next 5-10 days based on my shipping options. Unfortunately I recieved them much later. I reached out to the customer service department after I saw there hadn't been any progress with my order. They responded promptly informing me that they didn't have the frames I ordered, letting me know my glasses were had made and were being shipped from another country so it was pretty much out of their hands on top of that they told me to expect delays considering the time of year. I replied letting them know that I understood how it wasn't necessarily their fault but at the same time I was slightly frustrated that a disclaimer wasn't displayed on the frame's web page before my purchase indicating that their may be delays of some sort. The representative told me that he would be updating me on any progress with my order and he upgrade my shipping which was very appreciated. At first I thought he forgot to get back to me on any progress but there was really just no progress to report on, so I can't fault him for that. I eventually received my glasses and the cherry on top of this experience was that my glasses were bent at the bridge. While it was an easy fix by visiting an optical department, I couldn't help but feel a little frustrated again. All in all a very average experience.\nEdit: Framesfirect contacted me, refunding 10% of the order. Nice customer service, here's your 5 stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:31:34.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I called to discuss why them over some of the more recognizable national brands and what they promised was a long relationship with excellent customer service. For the record, the service at Nuvico was terrible. The unit I ordered came in quickly, but it didn't work properly. Rather than give me a moments worth of trouble, they sent me a new unit that woks beautifully and everything I needed to return the broken one. I highly recommend this company and brand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:32:39.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

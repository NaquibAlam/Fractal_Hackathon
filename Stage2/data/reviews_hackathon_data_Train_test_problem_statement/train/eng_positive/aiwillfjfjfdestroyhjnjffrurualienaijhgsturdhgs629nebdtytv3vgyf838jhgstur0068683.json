A nasty pot hole got my front right tire for the second time in 2 years. Thankfully, I had purchased the tire replacement insurance, and it was replaced without question. The fellows at the counter were fast, efficient and professional. I was back on the road in less than an hour having opted for an alignment as well. Thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:17:24.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

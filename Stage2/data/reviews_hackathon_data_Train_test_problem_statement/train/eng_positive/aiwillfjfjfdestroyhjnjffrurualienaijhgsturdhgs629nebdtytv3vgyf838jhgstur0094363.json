Ping time should be 30 seconds instead of 15. Lyft Line pickups are mostly along the way except for a few instances where I found myself back tracking. Also goes for dropping off riders as well. Also Lyft Line should be turned off if the known destination of the rider involves us driving on the freeway, because it is very dangerous if we suddenly have to exit and if we miss the following riders' location we would have to find another exit and back track. Therefore causing us to waste time and fuel and possibly getting into an accident because we need to rush to pick up the following riders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:16:12.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

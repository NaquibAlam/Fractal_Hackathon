We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in their home in Playa Santa Lucia. We had a very warm greeting, the house was spotlessly clean (smelled of soap as you walked in) and the food absolutely delicious. The Cuba Libres were pretty good too!! The house is pleasantly situated near to the beach, where you could swim although the nicer beach was at Playa Los Cocos a taxi-ride away. The only disappointing aspect, which was nothing to do with our hosts, was some of the litter near the beach which doesn’t seem to be discouraged by the Cuban government.\nGardys and Jilberto went to great effort to make our stay comfortable and homely, and couldn’t have been more helpful. Jilberto even walked with us to the bus stop to ensure that it did in fact stop for us and there were genuine hugs all round. We would love to see them again, thank them for their exceptional hospitality and wish them all the very best for the future. Just a little tip: get good directions for your taxi driver - the casa isn't far off the quiet main road, but it's a long road!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T18:00:57.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

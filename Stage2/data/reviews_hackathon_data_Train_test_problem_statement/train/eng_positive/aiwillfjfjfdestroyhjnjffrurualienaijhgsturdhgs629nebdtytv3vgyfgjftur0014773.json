I've been wearing this style for about 20 years. But CoolFrames had them. Not in the exact size I've used but pretty damn close.

I received a phone call to verify my internet order and had the frames within a week. Although it wasn't an emergency, I know that I can count on them in the future if I need fast service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T23:28:43.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I bought some trees for my wife for Christmas and they had to be delivered a week earlier than they announced on their web site. I sent them a note along with the order explaining how it was a Christmas present and the plants arrived 2 days early! We also had a plant arrive that was dead and they promptly replaced it without any problems. The trees are budding like crazy right now and look very healthy! You can't go wrong ordering products from Willis Orchards because they truly stand behind what they sell. I am definitely a Happy and Satisfied Customer!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T23:25:35.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

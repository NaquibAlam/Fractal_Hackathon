They were easy to use and I received my product on time. I also live chatted with them for clarification of some things. My only (I hate to call it a complaint because it really isn't) issue was the sizing of the tee shirts. I wish they had a height/ weight sizing scale for youth shirts. I was encouraged to order size small based on the age of my recipients but they were all too big, The girls didn't care they thought the shirts were great and they'll be able to wear them for a long time :)\nThank you thank you for the fast service and delivery and for a quality product :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:52:11.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

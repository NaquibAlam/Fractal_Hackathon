I was a little nervous about ordering glasses online because whenever I buy them local they always have a hard time making the lenses and usually end up sending them back to be redone. But no one around here sells the Gwen Stefani frames so I gave it a shot. I took them right out of the box and put them on and everything is perfect! Great customer service. Highly recommended :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:13:06.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

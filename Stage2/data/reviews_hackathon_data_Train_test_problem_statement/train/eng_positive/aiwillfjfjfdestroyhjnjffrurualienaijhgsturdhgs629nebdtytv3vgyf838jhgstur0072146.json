The site allows you to create a profile for more than one 'kid' which is great because you can save the name, age and size of multiple kids all under your profile. I ordered an outfit for one of my nieces and by entering her age and clothing size, FabKids translated that into their sizing system. She received the clothes and absolutely loved them! The same great quality of the fabletics brand in so many cute styles and patterns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:09:24.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

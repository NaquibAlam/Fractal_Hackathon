I ordered the lilies after 17:00 UK GMT to be delivered to the individual the next day. I was sceptical but sure enough, I had a text the following day to tell me the lilies were on their way. My boyfriend received his flowers after lunchtime that day and says they are beautiful. I am very grateful as this was a very easy way of sending flowers to somebody in another country!

I live in Canada so Asian beauty products aren't that big here so I'm glad yes style extends this international service. The only thing I'm unhappy about is the anticipation for my order to arrive, I select the free shipping option so it is understandable and sometimes my products arrive in 2 months, one time I had to wait almost 3 months which is kind of ridiculous. Regardless, keep up the good work!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:18:55.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

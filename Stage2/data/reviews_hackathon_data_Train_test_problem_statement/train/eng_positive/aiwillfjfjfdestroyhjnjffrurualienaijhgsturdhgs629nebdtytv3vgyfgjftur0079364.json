I have been dealing with Whole Latte Love for about 14 years, since I bought my Expobar Office Lever-- learning from their forums, product information, sales and tech support.\nMy most recent experience involved my inability to replace the brew head gasket in what seemed like a very simple, straightforward procedure. I ordered 2 of them, received them in record fast time & proceeded to try to install. And tried again. For hours. For days. Each time I called tech support the staff were pleasant & very patient but I was still unable to install it correctly & frustrated nearly to tears. Finally Todd, The head of the department, called me this morning after he received the pictures I sent & he was able to help me get it right. A few years ago I had to send my beloved Expobar Office Lever in for repair and I was extremely pleased that they not only fixed the issue promptly, but, because it was the result of a factory glitch, they did not charge me to rectify it.\nI place high value upon professionalism, skill, & above all, honesty and I will never deal with any other company but Whole Latte Love. I purchase from them because of their top rate products, value, honesty and terrific technical support.\nAs far as my choice of espresso machines, I would never buy anything but Expobar. My little Prosumer is a work horse that has been turning out commercial quality espresso, latte, cappucino & foamed milk every day for 14 years & this was the first time I ever had to replace the brew head gasket!\nExpobar + Whole Latte Love + Todd = pure perfection!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:04:41.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

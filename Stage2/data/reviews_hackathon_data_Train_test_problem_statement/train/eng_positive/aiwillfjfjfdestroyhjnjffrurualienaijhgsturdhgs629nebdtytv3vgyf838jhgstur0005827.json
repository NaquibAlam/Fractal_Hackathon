Within a couple of minutes of submitting a request for Quote: s for new homeowners insurance I received a phone call and was connected with an agent (Elizabeth). She was very friendly and within about 20 minutes she'd found several Quote: s that all saved me money. She stated that she wanted to do some more research to find the company that would save me the most money and that she'd call me back in a few minutes so that I didn't have to wait on hold. Another 15-20 minutes went by and when she called back she'd found a policy that ended up saving me over $600 a year. By the end of the day I received the new policies by email and was able to review and e-sign them that evening. The process overall was very easy and I appreciated Elizabeth taking the time to find the best policy with an A++ rated insurance company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T05:15:41.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

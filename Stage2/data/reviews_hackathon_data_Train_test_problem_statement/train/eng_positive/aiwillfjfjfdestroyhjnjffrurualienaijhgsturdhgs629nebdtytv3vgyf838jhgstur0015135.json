I've hired 3 personal trainers w/little to some success,only to gain the majority of it back in a short time frame because I struggled to stick to their extremely strict diets & 1 weekend cheat would completely ruin my entire weeks progress. But It's not like that at all w/nutrisystem! I've had amazing results so far.... and I still get to \"cheat\" weekly! Nutrisystem is more tailored to real life than my other diets...because nutrisystem created a lifestyle change while still allowing me to eat the carbs &sweets as well as factors in going out to eat during my week. In the beginning of Jan last year I was 200lbs, this Jan before starting nutrisystem I was 179 & as of this morning (feb 16th) I just hit 159lbs that I haven't seen in years! All i can say is try it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:43:18.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Its so easy, little fuss and has made my life genuinely a lot easier.\nNot being able to swap out a meal you dont like, but didn't know you didn't like until it was too late because the next order had to be done is a little bit of a bummer, but over all, really happy with it. After the first week you know what you like and not its a problem! The variety is excellent! I am not bored eating the same thing over and over again! THe option to customize meat with sides and sauces is the best part! 100% recommend!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T11:13:32.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

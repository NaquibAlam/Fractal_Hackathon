In that time I have had quite a lot of interaction with the staff on the Front Desk and the Office Manager. My impressions are that all of the staff are highly professional, as well as being really friendly people so that is a huge plus. They also respond to any questions / issues / needs extremely quickly. From what I can see the other services they offer are activated very quickly and work well (printing for e.g.). Overall I am really impressed with ServCorp and its staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:10:55.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Very friendly and efficient and tidy service. I have since mentioned this experience to a number of colleagues living in different areas of London. Several of them have used Pimlico Plumbers before and all of these reported the same quality and speed of service that I had found. I would have no reservations about recommending this firm. Incidentally, the plumbing problem had arisen late at night; my home insurance company were no help at all, saying that they would send a plumber (from a different firm) within 24 hours; I decided to turn off the water at the mains valve and wait until morning before calling Pimlico, the number for which I found on the internet. The guy from Pimlico, however, said that they would have come out at any time: should have called them first!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:39:41.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

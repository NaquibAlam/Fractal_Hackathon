Price was very good (much cheaper than one at a time or in small packages) and ordered them. I had not planned on spending that much on candy, but was delighted that I wouldn't have to go buy candy each week. They arrived before the scheduled time and are absolutely perfect! Thank you S much! I will be ordering more when my supply gets low if they are still available!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T12:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T14:44:37.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

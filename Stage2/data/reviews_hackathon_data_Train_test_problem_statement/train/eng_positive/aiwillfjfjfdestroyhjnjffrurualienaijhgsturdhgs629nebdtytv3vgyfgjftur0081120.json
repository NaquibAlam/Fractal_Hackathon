It works great and doesn't leave weird slick surface or oily residue, it's also my favorite scent wise that they do! Smells like the holidays.\nThe whatever and granite cleaner are better than those toxic ones and have amazing scents.\nWe also use the laundry detergent in lavender citrus and we have beautifully clean great smelling clothes and upon switching it doesn't irritate my boyfriends skin like others with perfumes and dyes that we used to use.\nI use so many products I can't say enough great things. My only complaint, well it's not really a complaint more of a suggestion or two is,\nThe smell of the floor cleaner and names of the products. I miss the fun labels and names, now the labels graphics and fun names like simply floored, Oakey doakey , einshine, take it for granite and whatever cleaner are gone and have generic counter parts. As for the smell of the floor cleaner, I wish I had another option, I'm not a big fan of the mint smell and wish it had more of a bright citrus smell with lavender or bergamot. It works great\nI just don't like the smell. But it's all I use on our floors despite not liking the smell, that should tell you something!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:09:37.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It takes a few seconds to empty drip tray and I warm my cup by filling w water and microwave on high for 1 min, then I have a hot cup, I needed a superautomatic to meet the needs of my wife, kids (hot chocolatte) and me ( morning time management), so far it's great.\nOn the company: product reviews, and videos are Awsome (it would be good if you knew the date of the video). Technical support regarding questions was not that good (my only complaint) there was a lack of enthusiasm on two separate calls with two separate people, it would have been better if they helped me make a selection and ask questions, they were short on answers and help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T05:12:30.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The wise, patient and detailed professional service from Karen Skauge got me through it!! My husband and I had attended their Open House this fall of 2016 to help narrow down our choices and maybe win a gift certificate. I was fortunate to win a $250.00 gift certificate from Ceramic Tile Works towards a purchase of tile. We purchased Cafe Azul Formica countertop along with Metallic Titanium glass tile for a backsplash. It has transformed our kitchen! We are very satisfied with the products, the service and the installation we have received from Floor to Ceiling Carpet One, Fargo. Thank you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:53:25.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

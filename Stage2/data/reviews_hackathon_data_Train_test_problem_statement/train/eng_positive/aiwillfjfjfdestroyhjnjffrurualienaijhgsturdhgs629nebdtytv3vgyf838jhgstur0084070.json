Bailey is our precious fur baby, a border collie, who has lots of energy and love to give away. The new location we moved to does not have a care facility for dogs so I went on the search through Goggle. What a pleasant surprise it was to find DogVacay. I had never seen anything like this program and was excited to investigate more. As I did, I found a wonderful couple willing to share their home with our Bailey girl. With the reviews they had recieved and their sharing of their expreiences with pictures as well, I felt comfortable in trying this new experience of private home care.\nTo our absolute satisfaction, we were thrilled with the outcome of Bailey's visit and would not hesitate to call of our DogVacay couple again. This is a wonderful program and my opinion is complete trustworthyness. This is huge, as we love our little girl very much and would not leave her with just anyone. Thank you DogVacay for the opportunity to look at such an important decision and try something new. You all are the best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T13:13:21.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

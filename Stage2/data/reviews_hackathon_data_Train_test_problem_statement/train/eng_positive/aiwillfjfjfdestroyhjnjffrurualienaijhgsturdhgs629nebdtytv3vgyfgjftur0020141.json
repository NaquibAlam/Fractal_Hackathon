I provided Karen a broad outline of what we wanted to do and see in Norway and our concerns about our mobility limitations.\nWorking on short notice, she searched doggedly for a tour in the Norwegian arctic that would meet our expectations. She ensured that the Norwegian tour we selected, properly provided us with the accommodation, transfers and assistance we required and we paid for. Our tour leader, Javier Martinez, a freelance Spaniard with considerable knowledge and experience from many years of leading tours in Scandinavian countries, was a very capable, knowledgeable and extremely caring man who made us feel special and safe at all times. Unfortunately, a couple of the Norwegian tour company's excursions fell short of expectations, which were beyond the control of our tour leader and of Eclipse Travel. Furthermore, the fickle winter conditions and the unfortunate blizzard that swept thru Europe kept us from seeing the Aurora Borealis. Nonetheless, Norway gave us a fantastic, memorable and exhilarating experience.\nIs it, therefore, any wonder that we have a very high regard for Karen O'Dwyer and have no hesitation in recommending her and Eclipse Travel?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T17:17:45.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

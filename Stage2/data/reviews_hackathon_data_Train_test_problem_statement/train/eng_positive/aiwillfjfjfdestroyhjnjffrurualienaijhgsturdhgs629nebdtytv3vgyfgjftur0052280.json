I have been shopping for a home theater set, but really couldnt pull the trigger. I had found and tried many of their seats but I was stuck on so many must haves.\n1. must be affordable\n2. must seat a lot of people\n3. must look less techie/less man cave and more family room\n4. must be a power recliner with power headrest good lumbar that we could also use as a sofa.\n5. I had to trust the manufacturer and the company\nI had almost given up but also almost pulled the trigger many times, but the sales people were always too pushy and not very helpful, or I didnt feel right about the seats.\nthen I decided to give 4seating one more try. And I met Dario at 5pm and he stayed with me after hours even though he was not a floor sales, he knew how to find out if they could make my deadline and solved the problem, helped me design the seating, he took me into the back and showed me soem technical details about how the chairs are constructed.\nClara was amazing she picked up the ball after Dario really set everythign up, and worked with both of us to get things straight. It wasnt easy at all, these things never are. When you buys something this particular there is a lot of passion. And again solved several problems for me. She also had a great interpersonal skills though at some points I can tell they were super busy, and she worked after hours to make sure we got our call backs and followed up on our shipping of the seats.\nI will say that not everyone at the company has this type of helpful courteousy, knowledge, as well as not beign pushy. I met several people most over the phone who had little patience and little customer experience. It turned me off before to buying with them especially at first, but if you are considering a hometheater sofa, this place is awesome, and if you find that you are talking to a person with few interpersonal skills or knowledge of the products, than dont give up try someone else. I will definitely shop their again. And I will definitely by our next set there.\nI would highly reccomend Clara. And I cant say enough of about the technical knowledge of Dario, I learned a lot.\nI havent received the delivery yet, so I will update this when I receive it and let you know how the delivery went and how the sofa really is. After spending 4K just for some seating in one room my expectations are pretty high, but I Still know that this was a really good price for how many people it seats and how much tech it has.\nt", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:08:50.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The pictures didn't fit the frames and the frames had no glass front or board back - they were just frames. This sat in a \"to deal with someday\" pile for months. Then when I went to Matboard and More my problem was solved in minutes. It was remarkable easy to use the website to put in my exact specifications and the products arrived in terrific condition within three days. Everything took minutes for me to assemble and i couldn't believe how easy it was to solve the problem I had put off for months. Two details I appreciated in particular were the film covering the plastic fronts so that they had no smudges and the carefully packaged mats themselves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T23:21:53.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

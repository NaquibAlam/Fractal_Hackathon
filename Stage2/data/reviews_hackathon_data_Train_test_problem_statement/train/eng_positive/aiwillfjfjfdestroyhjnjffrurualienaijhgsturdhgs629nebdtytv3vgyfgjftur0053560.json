I am a bargain hunter when it comes to books because I read so many so quickly that paying full price is just not worth it. I transition back and forth between ebooks and hardcopies. Typically, I use Amazon when looking for books deals but have found that Thrift Books prices are better. I couldn't believe it. I purchased two Nabokov novels from Thrift books and only spent like $20. To purchase the same books on Amazon would have cost $30, even with my Prime membership. I will definitely be coming back to Thrift Books more often!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:43:45.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

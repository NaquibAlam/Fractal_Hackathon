First off the company asked where we lived, then assigned an agent to help assist us from a close area! That was KEY as our consultant assigned, Aaron Vanecek, anticipated what someone from the Midwest would want in a vacation paradise. Then asked for our kids ages and found wonderful opportunities for them on vacation! In addition, he was able to not only give us unforgettable experiences, he was able to provide the ability to see more of Costa Rica in the week we could go than ever expected. Aaron become a trusted advisor and friend. I would strongly recommend the company because the first thing they do is assign a consultant that becomes your advisor, \"learns\" you and what your family wants, LISTENS, and proposes wonderful options, all within a budget (and saved us too!).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:28:39.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

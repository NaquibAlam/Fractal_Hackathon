Add to that the $55 fee for coding it to my car, which didn't work, plus the time away from work.\nThis was an awesome solution. Only wish I had discovered it earlier. Since I had already removed the original module I only needed to package and ship the unit. A few days later it arrived. 30 minutes of removal of the other module and installation of the original module and no more SRS light.\nIn addition to the SRS module reset this group offers other useful services for BMW owners.\nI highly recommend you consider MyAirbags. I'll certainly use them to fix the problematic cluster pixel issue that all BMW's suffer from.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:35:00.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

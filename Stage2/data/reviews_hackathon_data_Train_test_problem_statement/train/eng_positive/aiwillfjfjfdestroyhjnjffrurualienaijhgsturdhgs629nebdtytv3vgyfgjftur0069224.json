Then the other day my phone dropped out of my hand onto the pavement and shattered the screen. I did not have a screen protector on it at the time and did not have a very safe case either, just more for looks then taking a hit. I Googled places to fix my phone screen near me and this kiosk at my grocery store popped up. It was easy to use, I signed up and paid on line, dropped the phone off on my way home and picked it up the next day on my way home. They were super quick and my phone works fine. They kept in contact with me through my email during the whole process so it was really convenient. I had no worries and def read up on the online reviews and asked others who have used their service. I will use them again, which is why I wrote this review, in hopes they don't disappear on me, because I am almost certain I will drop my phone again in the near future.\nThanks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:32:35.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Nothing worse than finding a desired flight (originating in canada) but not know that it was really in US$ until the payment screen is displayed.\nAlso like absence of popups claiming to find a lower price if one chats or phones. They just waste your time, start by offering a higher price, dont bother reading what you ask for, and then try to claim what you found was really in US$. I wont name the site that just did that to me but then I went back to flight hub and booked without \"friction\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T15:48:27.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

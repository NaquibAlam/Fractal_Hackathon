I was actually getting a second opinion of a major repair (water pump issue). I was treated so well by all the staff involved (during the water pump replacement) that I decided to change my servicing to Motorama. (As I promised) The Tarago subsequently went through a few more services through Motorama and again, it was excellent. (Our service co-ordinator was amazing). It was now time to trade the Tarago in and there was no doubt in my that Motorama would get my business. And so we now have a new Rav4. Again all staff involved with the sale of the car were fantastic and our sales person was awesome. Well done to team Motorama. In my opinion, that's a good sale process, and everyone is happy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T07:33:31.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

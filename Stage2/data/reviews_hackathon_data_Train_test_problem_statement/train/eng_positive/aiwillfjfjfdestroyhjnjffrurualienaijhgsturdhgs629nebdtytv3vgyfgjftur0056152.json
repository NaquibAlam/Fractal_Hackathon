These days we all want free shipping the lowest cost and a quick delivery. MEDICATION IS NOT AN iPHONE. SO i am not going to discuss what I purchased only because it is a private matter about my health and I sincerely feel my experience going through the process of getting it is much more relevant and much more sweeter the readers on this site. And i hope I can make few people more comfortable with placing their medical prescriptions with KIWIDRUG.COM\nI have always been wary of purchasing things as important as either my prescribed medication which I did for a short from Canada ( i will not name them ) or over the counter medications online. I felt my hard earned money is going to the Lala land and really not knowing when or how or what I will be receiving in exchange. Often times these companies dont have a real address or a real person to answer phone calls or even an email. Regardless of how fancy their website might have been. Well, i am here tonight ( just received my order from KIWI ONLINE PRESCRIPTION COMPANY AKA KIWIDRUG.COM ) to let everyone know that I was wow'd from my first contact to just now receiving my medication. First, I could tell they are not in a rush to make a buck off of my back. Their mannerism online via email from the front line to the top manager all had a voice of concern and professionalism. I say concern because under no law that I am aware of is KIWIDRUG.COM obligated to provide first class professional medical advise and support from a real physician. I dont know of any other company that does that. It s not a robot its the real thing. They make you go through a thorough application process so if need be their medical staff can intervene and provide you with the absolute correct responses. I was so impressed with the application while completing it but even more impressed because they actually read it. Had they not had this process in place , i would have ordered eventhough I had a prescription - the wrong medication. Because they have certain mechanism in place to bullet proof the process- they can comfortably say that 100% customer satisfaction is guaranteed if they didn't have these mechanisms in place most likely they would not have advertised that information. Another example as mentioned few lines before, upon reviewing my application i had filled out and the prescription by the doctor, KIWIDRUG.COM team realized quickly I was ordering totally the wrong item. They contacted me immediately informed me of what I needed and in some ways held my hand through this process of voiding reordering and etc. So how can I or you not enjoy such service and begin to trust them as the professionals that they are. Lastly one quick note, with so much fraud going on, KIWIDRUG.COM provides us with plenty of different ways to pay for our purchases. They tell you what they prefer, but one had a whole range of paying them. So to the complainers about payment method, use what makes you comfortable and provides you a less stressed transaction. I repeat they have the right to tell us what they prefer but also they are professional and knowledgeable enough to provide options to us. And we get to choose within one over the other but all within the boundaries of options they provide. So to end this sweet story, I am now a true believer of KIWIDRUG.COM AND a committed royal buyer to this company. You have nothing to loose except your hard earned dollars in the U.S. specially if you're struggling with the high cost of prescription.

Packaging was excellent and all items were of great quality and cut exactly to my specifications. One of the acrylic plates had a scratch, which could not have been noticed by the frame shop (or me) until the paper was removed; this item was replaced promptly and the customer service rep couldn't have been nicer. Overall a very positive experience and I would(and have) buy from them again. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:22:19.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

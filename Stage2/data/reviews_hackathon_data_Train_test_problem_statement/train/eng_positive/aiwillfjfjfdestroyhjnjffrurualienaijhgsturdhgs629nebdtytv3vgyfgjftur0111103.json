I was expecting a few small raspberry bushes and was pleasantly surprised at the size and quality. They were a Christmas present to my uncle after his gardener ripped out the struggling raspberry bushes thinking they were weed. There will be no mistaking these as they are healthy vibrant plants. I must mention the size of the raspberry plants. Three and a half feet tall and around Â¼ inch in diameter.\nThis made my uncle have a Merry Christmas.\nPRICELESS\nThank you,\nPaul M.

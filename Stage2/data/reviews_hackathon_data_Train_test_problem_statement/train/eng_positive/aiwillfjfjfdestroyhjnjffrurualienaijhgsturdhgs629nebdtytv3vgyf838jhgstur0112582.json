For starters the search option finds items specific to what you are searching for and doesn't cause wasted time by cluttering the results with non-related items.

Other than that one minor glitch, it is always a pleasure to do business with a company that values it's customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:34:33.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

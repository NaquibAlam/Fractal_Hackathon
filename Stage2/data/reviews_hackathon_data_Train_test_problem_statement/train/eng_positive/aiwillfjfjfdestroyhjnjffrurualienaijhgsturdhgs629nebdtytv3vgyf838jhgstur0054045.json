Over 25 days we traveled to Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Bangkok and Hong Kong. The trip was awesome from start to finish. I have to commend our Goway representative Ayesha Colquhoun from the Vancouver office for helping me put together our itinerary. She was wonderful to work with - giving suggestions on what we should include and see and always returned my emails promptly. The company Goway uses in Asia - ICS was excellent. The tour guides they provided were all exceptional with their knowledge of the places we visited and met all our needs from picking us up at the airports to getting us onto our next destination.\nI would certainly recommend both Goway and ICS if you wish to have a expertly planned and executed trip to this area. My only regret is that we didn't have more time to explore each country as I felt we only touched the surface of this fascinating area.\nJane Chasowy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T19:09:03.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

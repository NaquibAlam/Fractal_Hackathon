I reached out to customer service via the chat function and the representative was soooo accomodating, polite, and quick! As soon as I gave her my order number, she was able to get the items shipped that day and I received the package two days later. Also, the packaging was very careful and they give you plenty of complimentary mints! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE The House of Bachelorette and will recommend them to all of my friends!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T15:11:22.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

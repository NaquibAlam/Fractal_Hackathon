Our advisor Aaron was spot on in his accommodation recommendations as well as activities we might enjoy. In particular we were blown away with the beauty of our lodging at Nayara Resorts. We would not have stayed here were it not for Aaron's suggestion. During our vacation he contacted us to ensure everything was OK and to ask if he could do anything further for us. Travel arrangements in country went like clock work--drivers were always on time and the vans were spotless inside and out. Overall we extremely impressed with the services provided by Costa Rica Vacations and will definitely use them in future visits to the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:52:25.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They have a wide selection of products, their website is very informative, instruction manuals are clear and many troubleshooting guides are available.\nAll that being said nothing beats their customer service. I ordered a radio from that, which I found out was defective once tried to use it. I called Right Channel Radios, talked to Pat and they had a new radio sent to me that same day.\nIt was a pleasure purchasing my first CB radio kit from Right Channel Radios and I plan on doing more business with them in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T22:40:24.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

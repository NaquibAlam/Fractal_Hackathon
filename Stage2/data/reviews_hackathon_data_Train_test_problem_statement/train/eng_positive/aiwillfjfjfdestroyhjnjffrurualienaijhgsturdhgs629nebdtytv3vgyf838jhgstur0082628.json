For a reasonable price, somewhat lower than custom framing, I have had good results framing many items from prints to objects. Once I figured out the newer ordering software, it has been easy and the results have been accurate. A good change they made was providing frames pre assembled. Two key strengths I wanted to mention was 1) the complete product line which includes tools and accessories as well as a large selection of frames/mats and 2) the excellent job they do with packaging. I have never seen such a professional packaging job and the company stands behind their products with good customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:09:10.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

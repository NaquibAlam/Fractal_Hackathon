Fantastic service provider of great royalty free content that I use everyday in my documentary film-making. Unlike with other providers, what I love the most is that each purchase comes with a proof of licence in my name. This makes life so much easier when needing to provide proof to YouTube or film festivals. Also the weekly Freebies are brilliant. Happy customer!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:25:04.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

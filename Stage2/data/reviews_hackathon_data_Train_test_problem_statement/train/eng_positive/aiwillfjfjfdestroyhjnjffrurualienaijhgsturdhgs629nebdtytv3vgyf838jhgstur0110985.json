I know it sounds crazy!\nBut every time I have an issue they are there to talk me down off of the ledge...I've never had a problem (some created purely by me lol) they couldn't solve or guide me through in more than 7 years.\nYou'd like to never have to use tech support at all and I really haven't used it that much over the years...and when I do, it's usually because I need step-by-step instruction! But it's nice to know that if there are any issues, things are handled right away and in expert fashion!\nThank you GoDaddy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T06:34:08.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

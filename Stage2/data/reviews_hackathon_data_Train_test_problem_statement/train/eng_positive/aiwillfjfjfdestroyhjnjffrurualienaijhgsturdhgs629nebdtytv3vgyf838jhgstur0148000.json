When ordering a book they give good suggestions on books from other authors and if ordering a book from a series they provide a list of the entire series so it's easier to get all of them without having to google it while ordering. Their customer service is very quick and efficient and if they give an inaccurate first response are very quick about correcting it. They also have a reading rewards club which gives a $5 discount for every $50 you spend even if you used a discount in ordering. I recommend them whenever the opportunity arises.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:46:10.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

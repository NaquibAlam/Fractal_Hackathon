No standard tour did exactly what we wanted, which is why we looked at a bespoke solution. They were very effective in talking us through our wish-list so they could understand our requirements. They then presented us with a draft proposal, highlighting things we might want to change such as which game reserve to visit. We checked the proposed itinerary against the guide books and our wish-list and discussed a few changes.\nThey then produced a revised proposal with costings. Their method is to give one inclusive cost rather than break it down into individual on-costs and then their arrangement fee. However the total cost was similar to group holidays from the up-market tour companies. In fact they gave us two Quote: s, one for staying at high end hotels at each location, the other with a slightly cheaper hotel each time. We checked every hotel in the guide books and the online review sites and told Enchanting Travels our preferred hotel in each location. They then gave us a revised costing which we agreed. They provisionally booked the hotels and our internal flight, we then booked our international flights and then confirmed our holiday booking with Enchanting Travels.\nWe had a car and driver for 7 days from Bengaluru airport to Coimbatore airport and a second car and driver for 11 days from Chennai airport to Marari where we were going to stay with relatives. Both drivers were excellent and we felt very safe. The driver linked up with the pre-booked guide for each day or half-day sightseeing. We had the mobile number for our Enchanting Travels coordinator and could ring her 24/7 through the driver’s or hotel’s phone. She rang us regularly throughout the holiday to check everything was going well. The whole process worked seamlessly without us having to organise anything.\nThe coordinator was very helpful when, on the first morning, one of us went down with acute Delhi belly. She kept in touch on an hourly basis, cancelled the sightseeing and delayed the onward journey until we were fit to travel. She then checked regularly over the next two days that we were OK. Later in the holiday there were a couple of times when the next day’s itinerary wasn’t totally clear. We rang her and she resolved it with us and advised the driver.\nWhile there were a few minor quibbles, there was nothing to spoil the enjoyment of a wonderful trip. We particularly enjoyed the variety of fascinating hotels we stayed in, and staying on a game reserve and on an Alleppey rice barge as a break from sightseeing cities, temples and palaces. I'm sure we will be travelling with this company again and would wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone planning a trip to India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T05:09:27.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

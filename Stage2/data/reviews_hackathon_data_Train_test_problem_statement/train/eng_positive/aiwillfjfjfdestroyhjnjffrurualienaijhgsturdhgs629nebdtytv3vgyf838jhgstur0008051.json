I assure you guys, situations like those won't happen very often.\nA friend and I bought some tickets for a concert in Korea which required us to travel quite a distance. Initially, I was wary and often found myself doubting the success of the whole purchase however I was proven otherwise.\nI highly recommend for each customer to keep in touch with the staff at Ticketbis. I would often use the live chat and email, to the point where Ticketbis kindly directed me to an email which assured me that I was on their top priority. It is good to constantly check on the process and remind Ticketbis who would in turn remind the seller, making him/her aware of urgent needs/requests.\nAs the date for the concert was approaching, I was surprised to find a notification in my inbox after school that the tickets were already in transit under 'Overnight Express', a week earlier than the transit date promised! Another advice is to provide the local address as they had stated as presumedly in some cases (such as mine), it makes it easier for the sender to send it to you in time without any problems or delays with the delivery service.\nThere was no problem with the transit/delivery/delivery date at all and I attended the concert and had the time of my life, feeling relieved knowing that the tickets were already delivered at the hotel way before I even arrived. Thank you Ticketbis for replying to my emails, requests, notifying and responding me no matter how many times I've contacted you guys, especially a few weeks before the delivery of the tickets. You have made my weekend very memorable indeed!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T23:11:01.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

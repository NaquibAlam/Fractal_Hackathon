He made sure that I got a program that suited my needs. He was easy to talk to and knew the different choices and the related costs. A pleasure to work with.\nAs I told Uriel, my concerns with Verizon is the installation and service afterward. The installer that Verizon sent for our initial install, several years ago, wouldn't talk to us. No matter what we asked he just continued to work and ignored us. Weird dude! We were glad when he left our home.\nWhenever I called for service I always got a Fred, or Harry in Bangladesh. Very frustrating and a waste of my time. I never got resolution until I demanded that I was transferred to an American agent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:55:22.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The Manager, Damien, was great. When he found out that our organizer was not in the boot he quickly offered what he had in his office. Duane was also great in explaining the features of the car. Chris did well in arranging our financing. Jason was also very accommodating when it was time for us to pick up the car. All in all, it was 5/5 rating.

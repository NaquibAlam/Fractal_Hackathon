None the less, he made sure that I knew and understood going forward that I could have the option to be refunded, or to wait it out. I chose the latter. He then offered me an express shipping option free of charge to help as they were ordering from their supplier in a few days.\nExtremely great person, easy to talk to, and most importantly great service. Dude deserves a raise (If anyone at StoreDJ is reading this haha)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:46:04.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

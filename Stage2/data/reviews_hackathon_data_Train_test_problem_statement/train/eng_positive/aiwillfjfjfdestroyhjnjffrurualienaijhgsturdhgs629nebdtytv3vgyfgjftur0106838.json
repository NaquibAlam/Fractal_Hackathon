We needed a storage fast. We were greeted by Chanell and we were out of there in 15 minutes. She was so professional, helpful and NICE!\nWhen we started the move we realized quickly we needed a bigger space! Again, Chanell fixes us up PRONTO. Then at the very last minute, literally 5:55 & they close at 6, we realized the other party helping us took off an hour earlier with the lock so once again Chanell was there to save the day and sell us another lock! This was most impressive to me, a lot of folks would let the phone ring at 5:55! You might think well why didn't I just go to office? Well that's yet ANOTHER way Chanell helped us I was headed up there but didn't know how to get out the gate from the storage yet lol! S thankful she answered the phone and so were the guys who moved us.\nMany many thanks for your over the top customer service Chanell. Looks like we picked the right company!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:46:01.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

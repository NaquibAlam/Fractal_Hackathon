The hotels were fine and the tours excellent . The highlight was the Penguin Tour on Phillips Island . Was everything perfect - No - but we adapted . We were booked on the last flight of the day from Melbourne to Sydney with a half hour stop over to Ayers Rock . We changed it to an earlier flight and made our connection but our original flight did not . I would suggest not to book the last flight when you have two other options within an hr time frame . We were sent to Kings Cannon without a tour booked , we purchased a tour from the bus driver . I would book again with GoWay", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:02:06.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

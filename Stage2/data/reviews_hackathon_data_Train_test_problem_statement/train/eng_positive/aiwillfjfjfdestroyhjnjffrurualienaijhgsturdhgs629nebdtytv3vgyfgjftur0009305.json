I have never had an issue with them, nor have I had any second thoughts on whether or not that was the lowest price. This time, I had to book a return flight with less than a weeks notice, and thanks to flight hub I managed to book a flight that worked with my crazy time schedule (did I mention I have 4 kids? Lol) and on a lower budget. Because of this, I am able to be there with him when he needs me and not break the bank in the process. Thank you flight hub!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T18:57:17.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Contacts were scheduled to be delivered on Sat, Jan 14 by US mail. Did not receive until Tues (MLK day on Mon), so actually took 9 days from date ordered. Since we sometimes receive packages on Sunday by US mail, it must not have been in the system even then. Not a big issue except concerned about leaving in mailbox for extended period of time in January in Ohio which caused me to continuously check if delivered. This was a delivery issue, not in OptiContacts control.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T19:55:41.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

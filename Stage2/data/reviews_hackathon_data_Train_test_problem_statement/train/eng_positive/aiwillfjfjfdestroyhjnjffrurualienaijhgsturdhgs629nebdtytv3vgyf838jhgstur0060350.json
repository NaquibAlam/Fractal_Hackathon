Through research you can see they evolved along time and they didnt stop adding new features or improvements. This way you feel confident making apps or grow. Every product no matter where you buy it has bugs or things we don't like, but no every business has the ability to make you feel heard and backed up all the time. Thanks Shoutem!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T14:10:06.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

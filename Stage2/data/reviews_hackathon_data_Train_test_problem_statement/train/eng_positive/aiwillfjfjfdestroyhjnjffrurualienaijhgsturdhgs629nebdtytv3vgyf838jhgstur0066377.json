Their selection and choices of urns are second to none. Most important, the people there (Tracy, Jill) were extremely helpful with answering my questions and offering suggestions. As it turned out, I had enough ashes of my daughter's beloved black lab, Lily, that I ordered a second urn (identical to the first) so both my daughter and my wife and I could make a tribute (including pictures) to Lily at both our home and my daughter's apartment. I would highly recommend Mainely Urns to anyone who wants to have a quality everlasting memorial of their pet. Thank you, Mainely Urns, very much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T23:56:35.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

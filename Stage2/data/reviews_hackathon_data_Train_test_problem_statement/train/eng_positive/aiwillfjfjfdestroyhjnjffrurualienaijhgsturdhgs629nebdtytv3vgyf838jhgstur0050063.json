Even if they do not have the dress you like in your size they have another one from that designer so you can check the fit. The women who worked with my daughter was very helpful. They are very organized so that the process moves along. The only down side is that they don't provide a place for the parents to sit as the girls are coming out in their dresses so it is hard to see around people. Would be nice if they had some chairs or couches so everyone stays back until your daughter comes out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T23:42:30.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

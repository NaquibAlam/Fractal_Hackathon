We had used Doyouspain previously with no problem. Initially booked car for a fortnight then changed our mind for 2 separate periods of hire during a 3 week period. I rebooked the first week and then thought I'd wait to make sure I'd got the refund for the cancellation first. I had an almost immediate acknowledgement of my wish to cancel with a message that refund would appear in my account in 3-4 working days. Refund was received in 2 days. Have now booked the second hire!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T20:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:17:46.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

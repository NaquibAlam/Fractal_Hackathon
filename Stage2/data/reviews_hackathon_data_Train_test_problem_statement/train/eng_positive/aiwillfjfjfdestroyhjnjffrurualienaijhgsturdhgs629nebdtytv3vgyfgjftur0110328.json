I had ordered a wedding photo album on line and when I received it the front panel was falling apart. I was discouraged as the wedding was too soon to order another and have it delivered. I thought I will have to try and glue it back together myself. I sent an email to their customer service to air my disappointment and much to my surprise I received a reply immediately. Within minutes they had arranged for a store located nearby to replace it and so I went in and got one. Wonderful customer service!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:49:31.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

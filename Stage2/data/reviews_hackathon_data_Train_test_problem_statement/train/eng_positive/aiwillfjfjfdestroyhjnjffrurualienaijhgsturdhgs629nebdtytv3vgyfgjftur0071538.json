Thier selection is much better than any bookstore. Eventually they will have any title you might be seeking for five dollars or less, most of the time. Free shipping if you purchase 50$ worth. Amazon, where books are 3.95, and shipping is 4.99, with no combined shipping, eat crow!\nHowever Thriftbook's web site is clunky. Any Decent database programmer could easily streamline it. When setting up a wish list, you can only wish for the form of the title which is in stock. Kind of defeats the purpose! I have often ended up without a dust jacket or with an ex-library book or trade size hardbacks, when I really only want to collect full size volumes with dust jackets in good condition. The web site is simply clunky and slow! Perhaps the fact that my husband was a lifelong programmer gives me some insight?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:35:46.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

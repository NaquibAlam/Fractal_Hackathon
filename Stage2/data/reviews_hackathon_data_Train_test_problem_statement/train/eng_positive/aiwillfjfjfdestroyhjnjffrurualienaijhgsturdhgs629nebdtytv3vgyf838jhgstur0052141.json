They have EVERY STYLE you could think of.. From the \"Girls Night Out\" to the \"Sexy Cowgirl\" look.. They even have the \"Office\" and \"Back to School\" look (for teens).. They have the best shoes, clothing and accessories for reasonable prices.. Everything fits true to size and look like the pictures online.. I never had a problem ordering from Ami's on their behalf.. However, I did have a minor problem a few years ago with a package I received... BUT that was all UPS fault for not handling my package with care.. The box was damaged badly and a chain was broken on my sandal which was fixable.. I receive(d) all of my packages in a timely manner.. I have no complaints..! I would recommend AmiClubwear.com to anyone.. There's a sale everyday so you save everyday.. Honestly, I love everything on their website but, I love their shoes the most..! I'm a shoe-a-holic ha ha..! I get so many compliments on a daily basis about my shoes.. I tell everyone to check out AmiClubwear.com.. They're the best..! The bonus part about shopping on AmiClubwear.com is whatever they don't have in your size, you can have them email you when it's back in stock (in your size)..! Plus, you can shop with the new trend(s) because everything on here is the latest style.. Now that's just lovely â™¡", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T15:55:58.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

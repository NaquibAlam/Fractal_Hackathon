But the help and feedback was great. Also-since I was buying them at the end of the year- really glad they understand what is needed for the health savings accounts (thanks).\nThese do what I wanted them to do. I have a progressive lens, so I can read a ski resort map when I need to, yet be fine on the slopes. I also wondered if the location of prescription gradient withing the lens might be a problem- but I am quite pleased.\nGiven the size of the prescription lens and the pieces that are bent to fit them into the goggles- I had anticipated that these might be irritating in my peripheral vision. I thought this could be the downfall for me. Not true.\nI tested them on a sunny day and a snowy overcast day. On both days I was happy with the results. These are a keeper. I ordered a pair for my husband- and since he perspires a bit- he struggles with the fogging in the Smith Goggles with the fan. So I am hoping the lens inset works well for him- excited for him to try it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T23:31:05.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

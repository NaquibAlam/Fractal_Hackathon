So I called Chewy to say that I did not want that, because I need to change my cat's food due to digestion problems. Not only did they credit me for the two unopened bags of food, as well as shipping charges, they also asked me to donate the food to a shelter! They couldn't have been nicer. Very impressive! They have me for a customer forever! Thanks Chewy - class act.

I was so impressed to receive such a gorgeous collection of samples!\nBeing able to hold the samples convinced me to immediately abandon any ideas of ordering anywhere else, because the samples were s good! Their most basic cards are a million times better than the so called \"upgraded\" cards at my local business card printing places.\nAs a very frugal person, I usually look for the least expensive options, but in this case, I really believe it's the smart thing to do to go with MOO, because in the long run I'd be saving money by not having stacks of inferior business cards gathering dust in my closet. Instead, I'll have stunning, amazing cards that I can be proud to hand out.\nThroughout the process, I had help from lovely, friendly, caring MOO experts such as LeeNicole, Greg, Saul, Danielle, Kelly, Nusaiba, Saul, Vanessa, Kayla and Amber. They're so caring and positive, I can't believe how they've made me laugh and feel good. It's really rare to find such a supportive company.\nI received my cards so quickly, and they came out beautifully, that I wanted to jump up and down because they were so stunning. The colors were just right, the texture, the paper quality, the printing, everything! I can't stop looking at them and touching them. To me, it's super important to have good colors and clarity in my photos, so I'm very glad Moo made my dream come true!\nOn some of them, despite my best efforts and obsessive checking a million times, I still made a design mistake, and Saul helped me to fix it. He was so helpful and understanding. I'm very thankful that he didn't laugh at my dumb mistake. As a perfectionist, it's really painful to realize I messed up, and Moo helped me solve the problem. I'm so grateful, eager and confident to order again.\nThis was my very first order, and it made me feel really excited and happy. I can't wait to order a million things from MOO, and will tell my friends about this excellent company!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T10:26:13.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This little APX vaporizer is pretty great too. I needed a new one after another Grenco one stopped working suddenly. The design is really nice! I like the THC Molecule pattern I picked. This vaporizer fits in your hand nicely, the mouthpiece design seems like it will last longer than others, it has more heat settings than others, it heats up fast, and the vapor doesn't come out much unless you're using it. It can also really rip! The highest heat setting is a little harsh for me, but the one below it works great for me. The only drawbacks I've found is that it can get pretty warm in your hand, it doesn't have the longest battery life, and you can't use it while it's charging, but it does charge pretty quickly so it's not too much of an issue. Otherwise, it's a great little vaporizer especially for the cost and great service!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:08:00.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

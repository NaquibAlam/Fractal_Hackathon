We had recently published a book so we included our logo, contact information and an image of our newly published book on the cloth. We display these cloths in our reception areas and while clients are waiting for their appointments, they can clean they glasses or cell phones. We do provide a spray bottle of lens cleaner to use with the microfiber cloths.\nQuality Logo Products provides excellent customer service. Not only are the efficient, courteous and professional but they also have a quirky sense of humor that will guarantee to bring a smile to your busy work day!\nI highly recommend Quality Logo Products and their microfiber cloths. If you want a useful promotional product, personalized designed microfiber cloths are a good investment.\nSandra L.

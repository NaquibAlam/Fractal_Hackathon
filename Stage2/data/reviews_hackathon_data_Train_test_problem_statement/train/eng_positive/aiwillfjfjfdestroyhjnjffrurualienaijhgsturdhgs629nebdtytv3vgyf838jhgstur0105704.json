I would mention one thing about the product. It is a Hancock Park office desk and hutch,SKU# 110282523, Model# H3681. The top center shelf has a glass insert.After unpacking the glass insert, I discovered the shelf had been installed upside down. In order to install the glass insert I had to remove 4 screws and turn the shelf over. The only negative effect is the shelf has 4 small screw holes on the top side that are above eye level.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:19:26.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

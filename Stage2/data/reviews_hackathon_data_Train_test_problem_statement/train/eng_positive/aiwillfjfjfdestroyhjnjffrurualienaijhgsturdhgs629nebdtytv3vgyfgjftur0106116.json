I'm a library person at heart, but they don't always carry the books I'm looking for. This is where Thrift Books saves the day! The prices are nearly always low and it's so easy to get free shipping. They frequently carry books I have a hard time finding elsewhere. I love the features such the wish list, the quality rating system, rewards, and the prompt to \"go green\" when books can be shipped together. It's like an online and more expansive version of that old, charming used book store everybody loves to visit. I've never had an issue with a shipment and am always extremely pleased with the quality of the books. I will never stop using this site and tell all the readers I know about it. I would love to see this site continue to grow!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T21:00:10.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was a local garage that was used and they came to collect the car and dropped it off after.\nI had some work that was needed to pass the MOT. I was contacted with a costing, I authorised them to do the work. A payment link was sent via email within 5 minutes and I securely paid the amount. The car was dropped off at the agreed time.\nYet again, I'm very happy with Servicing Stop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:57:41.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There is less dust in the puzzle sealed bags and they include a box stand now, which is very helpful. I made a mistake on my recent order and had to call to try to fix my error. Customer Service was excellent, also a rarity. The problem was addressed plus she informed me I had enough bonus points for 2 free puzzles. This is a company I am very happy to recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:19:52.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

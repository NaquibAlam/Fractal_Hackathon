The book I was looking for was really old (1904). To my amazement, Biblio had the exact version of the book that I was looking for, in fantastic condition, for a super great price! Also, they shipped it to me really, really quickly. I was also impressed with the way they packaged the book. It came in a box, bubble wrapped, and then after that was wrapped nicely, like a present, inside the box. There was a thank you note on the inside that was signed in pen, by a real person. I thought that extra personal touch was really nice. If I ever need another book, I will for sure use this site again! :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:00:15.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Since we have a good understanding of what needs to be purchased, my car purchase happens seamless with Kedar and his team. They were very flexible when my wife changed her mind from one car to another this time. Excellent customer service allround and I always have good recommendations for them. That's why I've made my third consecutive purchase with them. If you need a used car don't need to go anywhere else. Keep up the good work and wish them all the best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:24:41.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

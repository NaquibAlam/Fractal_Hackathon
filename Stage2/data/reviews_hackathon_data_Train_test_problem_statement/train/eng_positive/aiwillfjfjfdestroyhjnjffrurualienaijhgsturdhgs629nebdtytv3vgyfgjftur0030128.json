My alleged father wanted to make sure that I was his daughter. The staff is lovely. I called and they answered all my questions. I emailed questions as well, and they got back to me the same day. I also used their service to test my son and husband because my husband is dark and my son blue eyed light skin doesn't mean he's not his son. I loved their service both times ! I highly recommend them!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:20:48.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

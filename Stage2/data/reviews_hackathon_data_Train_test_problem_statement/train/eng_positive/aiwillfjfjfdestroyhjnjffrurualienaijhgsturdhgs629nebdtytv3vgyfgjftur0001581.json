This individual talked me through what would happen, giving a time slot as to when they would attend and then confirmed an e mail would follow the next morning confirming the time once again. As advised, an email was there the next morning, giving me a 2 hour slot where they would attend.\nThe mechanic turned up at the start of the two hour timeframe confirmed & fitted one tyre for me promptly. This mechanic called Nick was really knowledgeable & did a really good job. He confirmed an invoice would be sent by e mail which it has. & he disposed of the old tyre. Since the job was completed this morning, i have also received a confirmation digital worksheet by e mail clarifying the status of the other tyres which they checked confirming the tread.\nI am happy to recommend this service and the two individuals I spoke to, both the executive on the phone and the mechanic Nick, were really polite and helpful. This is a really professional service, and one I would definitely use again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:46:36.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

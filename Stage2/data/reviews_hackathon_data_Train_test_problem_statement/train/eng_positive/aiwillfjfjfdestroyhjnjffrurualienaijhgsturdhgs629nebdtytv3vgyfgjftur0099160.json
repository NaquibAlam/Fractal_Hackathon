The proof is in the pudding and the training curriculum they have is one of the best. Engaging, informative and intelligently packed with team activities, questions & answers. I especially liked the fact how the trainers engage the audience and encourage active participation which make learning fun and seamless.\nAnd then these guys serve killer breakfast, sumptuous lunch, snacks all included in the course fee (did i mention the exam fee). This was the best bang for the buck i could have ever received. I took the 2day CMS training and could not have been more pleased. Due to the fact that they did such an excellent job i intend to take my PMP training with these folks as well cause they will give me a discount as i have attended their CSM training.\nI whole wholeheartedly recommend Strategism. Way to go guys and keep up the good work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:50:07.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

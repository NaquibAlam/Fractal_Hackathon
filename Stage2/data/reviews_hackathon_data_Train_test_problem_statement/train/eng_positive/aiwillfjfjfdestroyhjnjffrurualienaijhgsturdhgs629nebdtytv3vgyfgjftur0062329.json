I was nervous after reading reviews, but the product - solid wood and furniture size was a perfect fit. I spoke to the company representative in the UK, who was extremely nice and patient, even after I told him my reservations. The return policy made me weary too. However, product arrived within 4 weeks. Communication on delivery was excellent, I received emails and text messages. The delivers were thoughtful, took their shoes off while entering and set the product up in no time. I was shocked at how well it is made. Better than the local stores here in Massachusetts. I will buy from them again, I wish they had a retail store in New England. But, will order online if need be. I am a very frugal and tough shopper. So pleased it all went well. Also, product was better than advertised.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:00:32.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We had to pay a extra 800.00 to make the change because China Airlines has a very Strict policy on exchanges, meaning they really don't care about the person, it's all business with them. You can get great airfares from them, but you give up the customer service that us Americans are used to getting. Savannah went out of her way to answer our E-Mails and phone calls, we are 15 hours different from San Francisco, we are living in Thailand, this met a great deal to us. Over all we would like to say, we have never met someone as kind & professional as she has been to us. You are lucky to have such a person working for you. Sincerely.

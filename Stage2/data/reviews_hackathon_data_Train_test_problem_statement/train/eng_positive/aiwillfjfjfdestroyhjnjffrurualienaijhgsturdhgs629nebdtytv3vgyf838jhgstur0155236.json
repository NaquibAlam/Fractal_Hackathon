They have high quality parts and great customer service. I had ordered a brake kit a few days ago and then noticed that they started a new sale, I contacted them and they honored the sale price, giving me a refund for the difference in what I paid and the new sale price. Not many places would do that. 5 stars to these guys. And best of all every time I buy their parts the fit perfectly. Thank you Performance Brake!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:44:44.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We went in knowing that we were probably going to purchase a dining set that we had looked at before. Our salesman was great - no pressure, but very informative and helpful. The sale price was great, an additional 10% off plus they paid the sales tax. Then he offered delivery that same day! We bought the set about 2:30 PM and had it in our dining room by 7 PM that same day. The delivery team was quick, efficient and professional.

I prefer Hello Fresh because for me the preparation is a bit less involved (not so many dirty dishes!!) while the recipes are still creative and varied. It's easy, straightforward preparation and often I find I can get more than 2 servings from one \"meal for two\". For the price, it's a great value for me and saves me from wasting food that I buy but then end up not preparing. I look forward to my weekly deliveries!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:41:49.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

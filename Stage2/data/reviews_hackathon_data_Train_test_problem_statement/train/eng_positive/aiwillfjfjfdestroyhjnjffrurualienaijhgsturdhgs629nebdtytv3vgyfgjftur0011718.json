We had reservations about the fit because she is 5'9\" and athletically built yet very slim in the waist, hips and legs and the dress is a two-piece. We ordered a large so it would fit her upper body. I wondered if the skirt would sag around her waist but it does not. Having waist and bust measurements on the web-site would have made me feel more confident in the size needed. I did appreciate having the height and shoe heel height on the model because that gave me a better idea of how long the dress would be. Overall we are very pleased with the appearance, quality and price of the dress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:23:53.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

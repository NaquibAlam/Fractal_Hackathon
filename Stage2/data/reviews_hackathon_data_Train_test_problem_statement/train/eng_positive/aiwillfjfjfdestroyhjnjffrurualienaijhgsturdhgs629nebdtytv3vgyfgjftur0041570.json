I have ordered 3 dresses with custom measurements and they have been beyond my expectations.\nWhen it comes to customs fees, no one wants to pay them, but it's hard to determine if there will be additional fees on items or not until you get the call to pay. I find that if you order smaller items, send them via mail to avoid custom fees, will take a little longer, but a bit cheaper that way.\nOnly other thing that I would highly recommend is to watch measurements carefully as every company has slightly different sizing and most are sized smaller than US or Canadian sizes. If you follow the measurement details, you will get the right sizing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:27:12.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

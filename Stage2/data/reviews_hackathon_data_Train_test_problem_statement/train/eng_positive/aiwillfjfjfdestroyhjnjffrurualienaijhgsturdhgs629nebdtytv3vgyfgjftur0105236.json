Solid web interface makes for a good online experience. Excellent range of products at competitive prices. CC and Paypal and delivery tracking options are welcome. Orders are despatched quickly and delivery updates are sent to advise the date of delivery. I have been very happy with the time it takes from despatch to delivery. Very fast.\nCustomer support response is fast and helpful. Out of stock items on an email advice for when the stock arrives works really well, so no need to continually check the web site if that item you need is in or not yet.\nOverall, full marks to Wiggle. I highly recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T15:15:45.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

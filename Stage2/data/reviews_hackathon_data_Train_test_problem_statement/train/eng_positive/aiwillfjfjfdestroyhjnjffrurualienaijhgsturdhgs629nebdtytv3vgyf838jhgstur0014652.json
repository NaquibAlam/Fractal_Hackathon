I feel like I'm eating healthier food and I'm learning every step of the way. The cooking process is simple, the plating always ends up looking professional and the taste is amazing every time. I haven't been disappointed yet. And the best thing for me is, no food ever goes to waste. We're only a household of two so it's easy for things to go uneaten when shopping at the grocery store. I'm always so disappointed when I have to throw away food gone bad before it could be used. And in this case that doesn't happen!\nIf I could make one suggestion, it would to be specific about when to cook what meal.. only because some vegetables last longer than others in the fridge. Or possibly include instructions on how to properly store the vegetables you have received for the week... I'm saying this just because there have been a few time we've have ended up with really soft carrots. I still wasn't unsatisfied, but I could see this turning some people off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:36:27.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

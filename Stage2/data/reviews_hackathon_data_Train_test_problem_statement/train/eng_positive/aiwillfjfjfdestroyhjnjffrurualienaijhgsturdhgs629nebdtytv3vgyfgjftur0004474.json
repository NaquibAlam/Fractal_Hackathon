They told me to switch head unit to the bypass/off position and disconnect unit using supplied quick disconnects, tighten head a bit more since it is only hand tightened at factory. I held the bottom portion with my feet and tightened top head, connected unit back up, cleaned water residue and once old water residue evaporated, no more leaks. I might have tightened about slightly less than 3/4 turn from original position.\nThe install process used and reason for install...tankless water heater and needed to avoid the scale buildup on the unit since San Antonio is aquifer water supply so lots of calcium/hard water.\nI used 1\" PVC to get the pre-filter and conditioner parts fitting together, my main feed is 1/2\" so upsized to 3/4\" then to 1\" to pre-filter ... then back down to 3/4\", then to the 1/2\" eventually.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T10:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:04:20.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It wasn't like there aren't any negative reviews about the website which is why I was a bit apprehensive at first, yet I went I ahead with it. After the order Juan from TicTacArea was in constant touch with me all throughout, responding to every small query I had. Their tracking system was also very spot on. I received the package exactly in 20 days from Spain to India! I am very happy with the watch, there were no mishaps with my order at all. This is genuine review and this a genuine website. Go ahead and get that watch that's been stuck on your mind for a while.\nP.S. : Do go through your country's custom laws for duties on inbound parcels. I ended up paying a duty amount for the watch but that was my fault for not having it checked out beforehand.\nRegards,\nChintan", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T05:30:11.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

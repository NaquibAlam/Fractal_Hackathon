We had never heard of Goway but as we began investigating visiting India, their name kept coming up. From the moment of our first phone call to Goway, we knew this was the company to go with. We were connected to Jamie Lloyd in the Toronto office. We were immediately impressed because Jamie had been to India three times so he was extremely well versed on the country. He was most informative and very patient with all of our many questions throughout the planning process. Jamie was very organized and prompt to respond to any requests and inquiries; always professional, sensitive, open, and had a great sense of humour. He prepared us well for this journey.\nThe India Odyssey trip was exceptional (18 people on the trip). We were constantly impressed by the organization and coordination of the daily events and multiple people involved. From the moment we landed in India, we knew that we had nothing to worry about due to the planning and organizing of Goway. Each day of the trip was an adventure with wonderful new and exciting experiences. There was not a dull moment. We very much appreciated having the safari at Ranthambore. It was a complete change from seeing cities and towns and gave us a very different experience of India. We were fortunate enough to have seen two tigers as well as a leopard (amongst hundreds of deer, monkies, birds, wild pigs, etc.). We also appreciated that various shopping opportunities (i.e. textiles, carpets, silver, general mall) were offered as options for those who wanted to go as opposed to it being mandatory for the entire group.\nOur main guide in India, Lalit Mishra, was wonderful. He too was very knowledgable and open to all questions that were asked. Lalit was very invitational, accommodated all requests from the various members of the group, had a good sense of humour, was very patient and handled all situations professionally. He was open to sharing stories of his own life as well as responding to some challenging questions about life in India and we appreciated all that he had to offer. As unexpected opportunities presented themselves, Lalit took advantage of them, always checking as to whether we were open to them (i.e. visiting a school, walking through an unplanned market, stopping by a farmer that was spotted pumping water from an ancient well operated by two oxen, etc.). Lalit worked well with our driver, Mr. Singh as well as the assistant Nandoo (hope that is correct). Despite the only rule of driving in India being that there are no rules, at no point did we ever feel unsafe with Mr. Singh. He too was very aware of unexpected opportunities such as pulling over to the side of the road when a large heard of camels and two shepherds were walking, allowing for some great photo opportunities or when he spotted some antelopes. It was clear that this was a team approach and we were well cared for.\nAt the end of India Odyssey, my husband and I went on to Varanasi. Again, everything was very well coordinated with Lalit and Goway. Our guide in Varanasi, Alok, was likewise knowledgeable, most helpful and accommodating. He was clearly passionate about his country and faith and was open in sharing that with us.\nAll of the accommodations were excellent. We appreciated having time at some of the more luxurious hotels to just enjoy the surroundings. It was also great not to have to always move every day.\nWe thought that we may lose weight on this trip but that did not happen as the food was excellent. We loved all of the options for trying the multiple varieties of Indian food. We did not get ill at all but we were careful about what we did and did not eat and followed the various recommendations that were given to us prior to departing.\nTravelling to India is a journey that is difficult to put into words. Most importantly, you must have a very open mind and a willingness to embrace new and unique experiences. We were exceptionally pleased with Goway and would not hesitate to travel with them again and do not hesitate to recommend them to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T01:50:31.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

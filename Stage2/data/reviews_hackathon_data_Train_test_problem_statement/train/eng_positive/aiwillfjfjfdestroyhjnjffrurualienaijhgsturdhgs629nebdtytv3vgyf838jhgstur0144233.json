What I didn't realise was that the gift sets were surplus Christmas stock! One is fine as I can give that to my father for Christmas, and I hoped that the other one would be useable once I removed the Christmas cardboard casing. However, the tag on the zipper closing to the gift set has a very definite snowflake on it, so that was that. I now have to go out and buy something else for my friend's June birthday - c'est la vie. Order arrived when promised and I can't fault the supplier, but it would have been helpful to see a picture of the gift sets in their packaging as well as everything else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:18:07.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Thinking I had made a mistake, I waited some more and contemplated my options (maybe PayPal would refund my money?). Finally (a few days past what New-Frog suggested was the latest arrival) my order was on my porch. I have had other orders come directly from China and they didn’t seem to take this long, but this was a much larger package. Initially I thought I would take off at least one star for the late arrival and my order wasn’t all that protected aside from the manufacturers boxes of which many were a bit banged up (New-Frog does offer insurance which I didn’t purchase). Fortunately everything was okay (no damages) but this is where the five stars come in. Given the price I paid, the quality of the products I bought met or surpassed my expectations and I am quite pleased. I also wanted to offset some of the very bad reviews I read on this site, I would certainly consider ordering from them in the future, I just have to be patient or not need the goods right away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T18:14:10.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have a 2007 Honda Odyssey and over the past four years I have installed three sets of rotors and four sets of brake pads.\nMy order came on time and as expected. You are able to follow your order with the tracking number which is good if you need to schedule installation.\nWhen I opened the shipping box, I was surprised that the rotors and pads were only wrapped in paper. Not in individual boxes. This did not bother me, I was just expecting the usual high quality cardboard, colorful fancy boxed parts. The rotors, though, were beautiful and shiny, almost like they were chrome plated. It's almost a shame to use them. Anyway, after the ceramic pads and rotors were installed I can say that there is a noticeable difference in stopping power compared to other rotors that were installed in the past. I did allow for a break-in period of about 700 miles where I did not break hard so that the pads wore in correctly. The stopping power is great, and there is no pulse or vibration when braking.\nMy hope is that I never have to buy another rotor or pad set for this vehicle, but if I do, it's nice to know there is a lifetime warranty.\nI will definitely use Brake Performance again for my other vehicles.

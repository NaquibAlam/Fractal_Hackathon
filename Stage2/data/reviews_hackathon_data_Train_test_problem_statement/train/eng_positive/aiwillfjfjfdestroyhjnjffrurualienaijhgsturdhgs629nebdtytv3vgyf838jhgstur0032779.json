Their seafood arrives frozen in handy individual serving sizes. This works best for us because we never know how many will be eating at a given meal.\nRecently we were sent some new items to sample. This was a great reminder to us that we were running out of our favorites. We also ordered new items to try.\nThe products we have ordered have always been top quality. I am addicted to the smoked sablefish though. Cannot get enough of that.\nThe only change I wish they would make is that their website would allow you to see more than one option at a time. For instance, when you are trying to decide which salmon you would like to order you have to go to each one separately and then back to another to compare. I like looking in the printed catalog because it is easier for me to remember which one I was most interested in and check prices side by side. It would be nice if the items were listed in a column with quantities and weights so that scrolling would give you all the information you need to decide. If you wanted more information on any one item you should be able to click and get to it from that point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:13:53.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

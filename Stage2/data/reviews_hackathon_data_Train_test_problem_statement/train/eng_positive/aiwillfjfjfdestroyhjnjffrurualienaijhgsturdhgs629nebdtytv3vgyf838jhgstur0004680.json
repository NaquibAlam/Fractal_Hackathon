The dress runs a little larger than the typical size 4, but I can take it in some in places. However, the dress has a horrible strong smell. I'm not sure how I'm going to get it to go away but I will be trying everything I can for you can't wear it with that smell. You would definitely stand out in a crowd, but not in a good way. Take that into consideration when purchasing this dress. You won't be able to wear it without doing what you can to make the dress smell decent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:28:04.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The browsing experience was great. There is such a wide selection of brands. My boyfriend being part Danish, I always thought it'd be cool for him to have a Skagen watch when I learned that Skagen was a Scandinavian company. I was able to find his watch at such a good price. The delivery time was right on time for Christmas! They packaged the watch so thoroughly that it arrived completely unharmed. This was basically a perfect online purchase experience!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:17:22.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

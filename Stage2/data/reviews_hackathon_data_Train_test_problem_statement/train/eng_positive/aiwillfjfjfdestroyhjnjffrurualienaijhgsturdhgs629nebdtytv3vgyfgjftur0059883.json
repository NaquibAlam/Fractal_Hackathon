The price is pretty good considering they currently have a niche market. Also, I love the fact that you can have a subscription with no pressure. You can skip months of delivery with no questions asked or start right back up if you need something and can change your subscription items at any time. I'm never buying store bought, unsafe, non-environmentally friendly products ever again.

It's sturdy, secure, and remarkably very simple to setup. KeepKey has online videos available explaining how to set up their product which was great and made the setup process a breeze. As someone who is relatively new to the wallet hardware market, I was first worried about whether or not it would be a worthwhile financial investment, but now I can say for sure that I'm glad I purchased it. No longer do I have to worry about online wallets having issues, charging excessive fees, or being hacked. I can simply send my cryptocurrency straight to this handy device. The other point that stood out to me was that KeepKey is continuously adding more cryptocurrency options to their product. This was a huge selling point to me since I would much rather store my various cryptocurrencies in one secure location than in several different online wallets or applications. I hope they continue to improve their product with additional cryptocurrency options and possibly a desktop application (rather than just the chrome extension)-- which I'm sure they will from everything I have seen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T21:14:24.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

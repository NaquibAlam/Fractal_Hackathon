I was skeptical since I have used other mail order glasses in the past and was not very happy with them. I used my own Maui Jim frames and I am so happy with the lens and they made my old frames look like new!!! (Did I mention the cost was half of what my eye care doctor Quote: d?) They were returned in just under two weeks. Proffessional assistant Nellie was awesome. Thank you for being so professional and helpful. I will use Frames Direct again and suggest to all my friends.\nPat", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T23:17:44.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After going without a website for a year I decided it was time for a new look and memorable website name. I started from scratch with GoDaddy because they were easy and affordable to work with in my previous experience. Starting from scratch is not cheap my friends. Almost $400 later I have a fancy new website with a great dot.com name for 2 years. I did have to call customer service because the initial price totaled after I was done filling in all the blanks was very high. The rep was able to bring the number back down to earth and I also got a promo deal on the 2 year service on my custom website. My customer service rep was awesome and helped me tremendously! I'm very happy with how my site turned out. There's still tinkering I want to do when I have time, but for now I feel good enough about it to go live. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I was blindsided by the cost. That may be my own fault by not researching how much websites cost nowadays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T06:36:48.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

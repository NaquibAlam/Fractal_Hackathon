Our city is growing and so is the cost of living. Simply driving for a few hours on the weekends allows me to keep up with the bills at home and have a little fun too. The people I meet while driving are fun and interesting and I love it. With Lyft, I've never worried about my safety, there are many ways to make more money, and I feel really cared for as a driver.

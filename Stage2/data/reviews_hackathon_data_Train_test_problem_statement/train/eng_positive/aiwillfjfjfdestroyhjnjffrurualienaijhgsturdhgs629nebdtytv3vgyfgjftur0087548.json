The prices are terrific and the shipping times are never too bad (about 1.5 - 2 weeks to Australia). I use banggood mostly for multicopter bits and bobs - for which it is terrific. Only on rare occasion have I had any trouble with an item not arriving or arriving with a part missing. But every time I have emailed the customer service department they were always really helpful and would offer a solution. Perhaps the only negative is that the rating system on Banggood is skewed to 5 star reviews and there was controversey over whether banggood was actively removing less than 5 star reviews. Although it is possible that this is no longer the case. However, it wasn't such a problem as usually you could just give a 5 star review and write anything you like in a detailed review. Overall though, highly recommend to use Banggood as it is a terrific retailer and I don't know how else I would find all of the things which I buy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:46:27.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Is it gonna just a daily driver to work or school and back; or am I gonna use it for hunting, messing around in the woods, and driving in heavy snow? A rig that’s dedicated to the trail can accommodate more extreme, in-your-face, suspension modifications. But if you still need to drive on the street, you have to consider the vehicle’s ability to brake, corner, and maneuver on asphalt. This is for your safety and for the safety of other drivers. With this lift I have the best of both worlds. I can drive to work and school, but still use it for everything else outside of that.\nIt will get me more places than no lift, and it s not a huge lift that is gonna kill the life of my truck if I drive it everyday. That is a huge positive to me. That is my thoughts on this 4” Rough Country suspension lift\nTire size and option\nYou can get good results by picking your tires first, and then choosing the appropriate truck suspension from there. Start by reviewing the suspension manufacturer’s recommended lift height for the tires. You want to keep the center of gravity low, so don’t chase more lift than what’s recommended for the tires. Otherwise you'll be way too top heavy. Also, note that a tire size recommendation from one suspension manufacturer probably won’t apply to another brand name. Pay attention also to any manufacturer recommendations regarding the offset and width of the wheels. The wheels need to match a tire size to fit the lift. Too big of tires and they won't fit in the wheel well. That creates rubbing of the fenders and less turn radius. Too small of tires will look bad and give more weight to the top of the truck unless wheel spacers are added to distribute the weight.\nPremium versus economy kits\nHigher lifts are more expensive, because they require more adjustments to the vehicle. Not all of those adjustments are directly related to the lift, either. You’ll face costs associated with the purchase of new truck tires, wheels, driveshafts, and other parts. Because of this, you may be tempted to purchase a lift kit that doesn’t include the parts needed to make the appropriate adjustments. This will save you money upfront, and that is why this 4 inch lift is the best fit. You are better off selecting a lower lift, because it will be less expensive overall. Every rig has an upper lift limit, above which your costs will skyrocket. Stay below that limit and you’ll save money and trouble down the road.\nLeaf spring kit for this lift\nOn pickup trucks, heavier springs will usually be fine as long as the lift is 4” or less. One consideration with this method is that axle torque will strain longer U bolts. As a result, the bolts will stretch out. You’ll have to accept the responsibility of re-torquing them periodically, but that is less work than it sounds like. Do not use lift blocks up front up front with a lift like this. A front lift block collapse would be disastrous and destroy practically the whole front end depending on how bad it is. If you have a lifted leafer, use polyurethane spring eye and shackle bushings. These hold up better than factory rubber bushings when there’s lots of flexing that naturally come with this lift. This is because the center sleeve of the factory rubber bushing is bonded to the rubber insulator. The sleeve rotates inside the bushing, which provides more flexibility. More flexibility means longer life. Having to swap those is one downside to the lift but can be an easy swap.\nThe right shock absorber\nAftermarket shock absorbers are not universally tuned for every application. Because there are so many variables involved, picking the right shock for your lift can be guessing game. To avoid guessing wrong, go with the shocks recommended for your kit or choose an adjustable shock absorber. This way, you increase the likelihood that you’ll end up with the ride quality you want. Some are more competent than others. An adjustable shock absorber, on the other hand, puts the power of tuning in your hands. This lift allows more range of choice than any other size or brand of lift. That is one more reason I like this lift. I decided to go with Bilstein shocks. They're a very expensive and highly rated shock that fit perfect on my truck.\nPrice\nThis lift and brand is significantly more pricey than a lot of lifts I was able to find. I choose to go with this one because it is worth every penny. It continues to surprise me everyday I drive it. It is a negative if you don't have the money to spend; but at the same time there is no point in putting money into a lesser off brand lift that's not gonna last, will rust, and have the metal bend. That being said, I think if you need a lift that's not overpriced but trustworthy, then this lift is for you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T21:44:33.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

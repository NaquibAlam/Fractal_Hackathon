I just miss several things:\n- when you are searching for a car, you have to search through all available car rental locations in the destination one by one - a feature is missing that would list you all available cars from all locations in the destination\n- when you get back to homepage and make a new search you have to fill in all the data again - I would highly appreciate if the data from my previous search were pre-filled already\n- when you get to the rentalcars.com page from another merchant (airline/hotel booking), you cannot specify your age (if below 25) and have to go through homepage again (and back to the previous problem)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T15:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T12:05:51.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

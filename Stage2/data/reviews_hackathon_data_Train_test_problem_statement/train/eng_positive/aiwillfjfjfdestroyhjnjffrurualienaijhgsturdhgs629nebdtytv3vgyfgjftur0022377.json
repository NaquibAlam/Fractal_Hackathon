I think their products age great, service is good and process time is reasonable. The only thing I would consider changing is for existing customers to see more details on past orders. For instance, I couldn't remember if I ordered a name tag for a specific employee. When I went online to the old order it just said quantity 30. I had to email for more information. That is the only thing at this time that I would aim to improve.\nThanks", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:56:26.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

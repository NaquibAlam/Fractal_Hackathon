The Canadian Banks (it may be Canadian Government rules) have even stricter rules than USA Banks to do this, which means you have to be actually in a branch to initiate each transfer, which is impractical if you do not live in Canada. OFX has a system for me to initiate a Direct Debit Transfer from their website (of any amount I want) to their account from my Canadian Bank Account and then OFX changes it to US Dollars at a very competitive rate and deposit it in my US Bank Account.

There was no easy way to install the system in my new home. Since there were no pipes to hook the system to, I hired a plumber to install the system. It took him and his partner over three hours to complete the install. He viewed the location of the install twice to determine what he needed to have to complete the install. He did a wonderful job with the installation, explaining the specifics of what I needed to do after he left. The water quality is great and I am pleased with my new Pelican system for now. I expect this to continue for years to come. I just want to say again that no average 'Joe' will be able to install this system in a house with no exposed pipes in the garage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:36:35.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

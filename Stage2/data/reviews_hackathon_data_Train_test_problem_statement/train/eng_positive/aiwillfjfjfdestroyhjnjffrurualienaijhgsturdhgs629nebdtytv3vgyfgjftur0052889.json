She explains everything before she does anything, which only adds to feeling of safety and care. I also had a couple of treatments with Adrienne and she is amazing in all the same ways. I've only had the privilege of being treated by those two, but I'm sure they all show the same care as they do. My only issue was with the appointment confirmation system. I loved getting the appt confirmation texts, but it seemed they were always for a different time of day than was originally set. You are in good, safe, caring, competent hands with LaserAway!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:40:51.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

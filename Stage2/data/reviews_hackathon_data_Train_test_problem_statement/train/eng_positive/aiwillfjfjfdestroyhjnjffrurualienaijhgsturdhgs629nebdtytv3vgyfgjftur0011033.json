Just completely ill-prepared and annoying with their endless queries and reiterations of what the lady behind the counter was telling them. Throughout the entire time she kept her cool, was informative and gracious in her dealing with them, a true professional and ambassador for Red Spot rentals.

We were so happy with our car that we will most likely buy a Kia Cerato next when we purchase later this year.

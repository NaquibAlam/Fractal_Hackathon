We have come to trust and respect his guidance and been happy with each and every purchase we have made from Grands. On our last Purchase G.C. advised he had received an advancement in bedding and would have to turn us over to another sales person. We asked G.C. to please help us as much as possible and he did so and we purchased bedding and a headboard and C.G. gave the sale to a co-worker. We sure appreciated his assistance! The delivery guys did a good gob even though they had to come back to finish the job (no big deal). The bed is wonderful!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:33:42.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I suggested I was chasing a commodore SV6 and what really engaged me was he did not talk money or a deal straight away. He showed me the stock he had available straight away. Once I had told him I was interested in a particular vehicle he then took me for a test drive and showed me the features it had to offer.\nIt was then that Cody introduced prices and possible change over deals with a trade. Overall the service was great, the price was great, and the salesman was a real person understanding the customer as a real person, not just another $ sign walking through the door. Again well done Cody and Motorama Moorooka. I would recommend all to visit this dealer if you are looking for a new or used car as they are friendly, experienced and family owned business, and treat you as a real person.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T23:47:10.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

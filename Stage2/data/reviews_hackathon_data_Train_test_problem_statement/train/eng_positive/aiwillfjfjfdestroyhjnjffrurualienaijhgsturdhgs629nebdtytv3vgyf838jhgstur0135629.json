It took a while for the order to be ready but when shipped they came in 3 days! They were upfront about shipping delay from the beginning, so all expectations were met. Just be sure you will be home when FedEx delivers from out of the country because you will have to sign. Just wish I had known this piece so I could have gotten a few days sooner. Overall great experience and I will use them when shopping for another piece to my collection. Thanks to everyone at Otticanet!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:21:25.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

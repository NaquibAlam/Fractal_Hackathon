Some bend on longer blind, probably due to packaging ,which was also slightly curved, but able to put up easily which removed any of the curvature. Some indentation ,only on the longer blind --2.3m--on top rail where each cord block had been fitted, but decided to fit as it is covered with curtains. Really does look good when fitted and works very well. Very pleased and will use again in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:52:56.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The left box was ok. the box of contacts for the right eye were defective. After only ONE DAY, each contact would lose shape, becoming pancake flat or wavy and unusable. (after soaking overnight in solution for only one night). I called to report this issue and they do not do returns unless the package is unopened. Obviously I wouldn't know they were defective if I hadn't opened them. Do not buy from this company unless you want to waste a lot of money. EDIT The company did send me replacement lenses after I posted my review. I changed the rating. I would have been nice if the actual customer service rep was helpful, but at least it was eventually corrected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:35:46.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

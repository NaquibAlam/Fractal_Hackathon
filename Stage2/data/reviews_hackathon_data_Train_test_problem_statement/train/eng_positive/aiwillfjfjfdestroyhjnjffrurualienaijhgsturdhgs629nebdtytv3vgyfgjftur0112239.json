One of their plumbers came round that very afternoon. He identified more than one problem and recommended replacing the WC, which he did the same day. In the process he noticed a broken seal in the waste pipe and accumulation of silt in the cold water tank. He returned the next day to solve both those problems. All the work was done to a high standard. Throughout he was considerate, cheerful and helpful, and cleaned up after the work. Pimlico Plumbers are not cheap but from this and other experience I believe they are well worth the higher rate for their combination of competence and customer service.

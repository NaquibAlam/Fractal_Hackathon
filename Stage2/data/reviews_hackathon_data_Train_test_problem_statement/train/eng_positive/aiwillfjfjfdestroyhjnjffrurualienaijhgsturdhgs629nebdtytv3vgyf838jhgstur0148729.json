I made about $100 from selling my textbooks to them. I have a paypal account so the money from them just accumulated there and then I transferred it to my bank account. I sent out the materials (which is free), and then a few weeks later I got an email saying that the books had been received and inspected. Low and behold, I had some extra money in my paypal to use as I pleased. The only downside that I would mention is that a lot of books that I tried to send back weren't worth much so it was a little frustrating sometimes. Other then that, sellbackyourBook.com is a great and trustworthy site to make some money. I'm definitely going to use it again when my spring semester is over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T19:00:21.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Highly recommend. Love the peel and stick and how the labels stay on the dishwasher and washer/dryer. I think I've only lost two labels mainly because I don't think I thought through where I put them on the mittens (I put them on the outside - silly me). And the other one not really sure what happened but my goodness, not a big deal at all. Just put a new one on! I handed down a hoodie and was able to peel off the label ams it came off nicely. Wow.

I had two packages which arrived together. Everything I ordered was in the box and undamaged. The installation went smoothly with no issues. The installation instructions were clear but I mainly used them as a guide since I used my own idea for the CB wire routing. I have a 2-door JK and the wire lengths were adequate. I had to paint the antenna mount bolts black to match. Other than that, I'm happy with this kit and company.

Of course, when I went to have it checked out at that time the car decided to behave normally and they could find no error codes associated with the trans. 2 weeks later on a Friday my car started to show the symptoms and called late that afternoon and asked if I could stop by quickly as the car may or may not show the problems if I waited till Monday. They had no problem with me bringing it by even though it was just before closing time. They were able to get the error code this time and I explained that I was going to need the car for the weekend but I would bring it by on Monday to have them do a more thorough continuity check. I dropped the car off late morning Monday. They were able to get to my vehicle Tuesday and explained that I required a replacement solenoid as the car appeared to be staying in a higher gear instead of automatically down shifting to a lower gear. The solenoid was replaced and a new filter (and transmission fluid) was put in at that time as well. The service couldn't be any better. I highly recommend Cottman's for you automatic transmission repair. Thanks Greg and Steve.\nMarkus", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:50:02.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

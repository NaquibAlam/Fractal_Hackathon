The local guides were very helpful and informative . The hotels were good for all the stops we made and the food served for breakfast was quite good.\nOverall the journey in Patagonia was awesome and the sights were astounding. The activities suggested by the hotel Tierra Patagonia was well suited to what we desired. We enjoyed our stay there including the activities done. We would have liked an extra day in El Calafate as this was the place where you come close to the largest glacier. It was a sight worth visiting and experiencing. El calafate being a quaint place with maybe other notable things was only a stop for one day when we could have spent an additional day looking at other activities there.\nThe trip across to Buenos Aires was also quite seamless, but we were slightly disappointed that we could not get to see more museums. We went to one where it was all in Spanish and wasted some time and entrance fee there although this should have been advised to us. The estancia trip stood out as it was immensely enjoyable and worthwhile with some horse riding thrown in. Pablo our guide was also quite informative.The dinner and tango was also good and the dance was quite sensational.\nThe Bariloche trip was good. Most of the excursions there especially the chairlift and also Mt Tronador was good but the last trip to the lakes centre was a bit disappointing for the amount we paid.\nThe trip to Puerto Varas, although through the cruise and buses did provide a close up of the Andes, however the trip was quite cumbersome as it went through various stops and manual handling and inspection of baggage by the customs and immigration. If there was al alternative as in a flight to Puerto Varas as opposed to this long journey that would have been satisfactory.\nThe trip back to Chile and trip to Valparaiso with our lovely and helpful Chilean guide Tania was also to be remembered as we saw Pablo Nureda's home on the hill in Valparaiso, soaked the sights in Valaparaiso with its bohemian culture and cafes including street art.\nWe definitely enjoyed this trip.\nJay and Kris,Vic,Australia", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T15:37:50.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

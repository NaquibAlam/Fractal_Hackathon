Topcashback has risen to the top. It has great vendors participating with liberal payouts. I am a little confused why more don't participate. It takes a total of about 5 minutes to sign up. Then it's just a matter of logging in to your vendor of choice through Topcashback...they do the rest. The multiple payout options with added opportunities for bonus cash is also a great feature. I'm not wealthy. I don't go nuts at Christmas (I can't afford it)...but through the last several years have cashed in close to 1000 dollars in real rebates. Money I can spend anywhere I wish...just for doing what I was going to do anyway and took the extra step of starting at the Topcashback website. Take a look at it. Sign up. ITS FREE. Look at the vendors available and you'll discover as I did, It's a no brainer. Why wouldn't I want to save an extra 5% , 10% or more on my purchases. (Not to mention fuel savings and hassle of store lines)....I do 90% of my shopping on line. Now I can even by non perishable groceries and have them shipped to my door and accumulate cash as I do. It's easy and guilt free to buy that certain item you've been wanting when you can pay for it with cash you've accumulated. So what are you waiting for....someone to sign up for you....and remind you to start your shopping free by going to what I call the \"Cybermall\" Topcashback.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:59:01.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My husband, myself and our two kids travel every two years to new destinations to meet up and vacation with my husbands parents, siblings and their families. This year would be from Atlanta to Glacier National Park in Montana over July 4th week. We anticipated spending at least $4000 just for the airfare....other family members traveling from varios parts of the U.S. paid an average of $1000 per person round trip. I was finding ticket prices to be no less than $4500.00 for the four of us on all travel sites until I found FlightHub. Not only did we book 4 tickets, with insurance for $2100.00 but we booked nonstop flights on our favorite airline and the departure and arrival times couldn't be better!!! Booking online was easy! I will make FlightHub my first search in the future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:28:35.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

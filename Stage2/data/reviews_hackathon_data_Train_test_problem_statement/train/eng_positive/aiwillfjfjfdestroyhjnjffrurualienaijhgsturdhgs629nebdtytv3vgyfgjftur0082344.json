It even includes child safety fittings as standard which given it was for a nursery was perfect.\nDelivery was timely too.\nWe looked at a few bespoke blind sites and found the price competitive.\nSo on the whole a good experience and will definitely use Blinds2Go in future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:10:19.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

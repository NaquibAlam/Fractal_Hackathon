I was looking for a pair of FENDI shoes to add to my collection. After looking at literally every website and store (Saks, Nieman Marcus, etc) I found SSENSE. They had just the shoes I was looking for; but not only that, they were also $120 less on SSENSE. I purchased them immediately and got them in the expected time. Overall my experience was 10/10 and I will definitely be purchasing with them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T22:09:03.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The only problem was no key. I was afraid to put anything I might need in it as it is so easy to lean against the button and accidentally lock it. Two keys were ordered from EasyKeys.com on Friday March 3rd. They arrived on Monday March 6th. The keys fit and worked without a problem - even in a lock that hasn't been used in years.\nWith USPS package tracking announcing the package was out for delivery on the 6th, I was saddened to find it hadn't arrived. When I queried my, usually very efficient postal carrier, about the package, I got a look of disaster. A few minutes later she was at my door with the package. It had been delivered to the same address one block away.\nNext time I need key, EasyKeys will be my first choice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T09:31:06.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After spending an hour with the sales consultant in my home and receiving a Quote: for $14k (super price) I declined the \"you must sign now or lose this fantastic offer\" and suggested he call me back in a week which he never did.\nSo I went to the web and just googled other solar providers and filled in online requests for Quote: s. Out of sheer coincindence I stumbled across Solar Quote: s and immediately requested 3 Quote: s from local providers servicing my area. Immediately I was contacted by one of the providers, followed by a second provider the next day, while the third provider simply gave me a Quote: via email a few days later.\nAfter spending time with the first two providers who came and visited me and wrote up a formal Quote: for me, I decided to go with one of these providers for my solar unit. I would have been quite comfortable to go with any of the three providers recommended by Solar Quote: s.\nFinn is really great and even answered a question for me regarding one of the systems that was presented to me. All in all this is a great web site and thanks so much to Finn for setting it up to guide us through this maze of Solar for the home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:07:29.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

While they may not always have new material for some searches, the amount of new material keeps most of yours searches fresh.\nOur only criticism would be that they don't offer charities and non-profits a discount! But despite that, we love the pricing for our minimal usage of the site, and feel that it is quite fair for use.\nSo, thank you to all the photographers, designers, artists, models and people that make 123RF possible!

Had a bit of difficulty with the assembly as incorrect parts were sent, but one call to customer service resolved the issue. The associate was professional and knew the product and how to solve the problem. The frame transformed our bathroom and we are pleased with the outcome. The finish is very nice and we hope it will be as durable as it looks. It has been in place for less than a month and we are confident we will be ordering additional frames in the near future. We recommend this product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T02:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:48:24.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Not because I don't like Soul Revolver. On the contrary. When I see that Soul Revolver logo, I know I'm gonna have to battle myself over whether to buy another jacket. Because I always want another. I've ordered 5 over the past few years (sad, isn't it?). And I like all of them.\nThis is all my 100% experience - no one has ever paid me for a review, I've never gotten anything for free, and I have no connection to Soul Revolver aside from being a customer.\nOne thing to note if you're not in the UK or Europe. My credit card initially blocked the initial Soul Revolver transaction because Soul Revolver is in the UK and I'm in the US and their system thought it might be fraud or something. I had to go back and forth with them a bit but it was fine in the end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T22:39:13.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

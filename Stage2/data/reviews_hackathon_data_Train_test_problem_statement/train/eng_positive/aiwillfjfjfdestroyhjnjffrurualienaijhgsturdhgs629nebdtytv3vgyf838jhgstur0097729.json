I also have a habit of spilling drinks in the car. Nothing is too much trouble for these guys to sort out! They plug in my phone, let me take the car with a emailed photo of my license or on one ocasion with an expiring license and a promise to send through the renewal! I once booked with a different company but found they were too strict to handle my disorganisation so i went back to reddot and they matched the price and bent the rules for me yet again! Love these guys. The customer service is fantastic for a busy and overtired business woman!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T11:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T10:04:11.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

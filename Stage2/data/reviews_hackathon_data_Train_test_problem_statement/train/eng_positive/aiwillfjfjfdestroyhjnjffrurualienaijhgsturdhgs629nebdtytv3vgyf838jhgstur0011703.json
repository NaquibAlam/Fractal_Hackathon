She clarified the confusion regarding the medicare supplement choices and the critical dates to keep in mind to avoid penalties. She also said her company monitors our coverage at future renewals so we can always be assured we will be notified if there is a better, cost effective option available in case our premium goes up. We appreciate the prompt follow up and the expert guidance by an independent agent which prevented us from having to call multiple individual companies to make comparisons. Annalin seems to be perfectly suited to her job.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:49:19.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

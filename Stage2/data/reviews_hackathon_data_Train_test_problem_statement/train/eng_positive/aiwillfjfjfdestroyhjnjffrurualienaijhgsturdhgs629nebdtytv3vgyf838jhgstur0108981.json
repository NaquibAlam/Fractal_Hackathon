Charges seemed very high , from the banks in both countries.\nOFX claimed to give a better deal - a better exchange rate and little ( or NO ) transaction fee!. I thought I would give it a go. Much better deal. Excellent communication without fuss - the whole process just as stated.\nI save hundreds of dollars each month. Great decision!

First time as a gift for my husband. The Impulse Cap fits him great. It's ventilated, which is a plus on hot days, and protects from the sun. After working outside all day, it gets quite sweaty. A quick wash in the sink, hang to dry and it is ready the next morning. The second purchase was a Snow Tripper cap for each of us. This hat fits great, I love the color of mine, Winter Berry, and the pull down flaps fit snug on my ears keeping them toasty on a cold winter day. We also love that we can fold them and tuck them into a coat pocket.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:22:24.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

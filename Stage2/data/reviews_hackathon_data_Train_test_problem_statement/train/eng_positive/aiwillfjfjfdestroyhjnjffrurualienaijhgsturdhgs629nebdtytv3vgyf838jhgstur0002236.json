My only personal, funny problem is when they say zest, I don't. I squeeze! When they say, use garlic press, I cut garlic into little, tiny pieces, lol. But all in all, it's so much fun cooking with different spices and ingredients I normally wouldn't purchase or put in my meals. Some meals are really different, I truly like them all. My husband is a boring kind of guy and he likes most of the meals I choose. I would probably like all the meals but again, I have to watch what I pick bc of him. The only small complaint I have is that some meals are not worth the cost. But I still continue to purchase them so that means something.

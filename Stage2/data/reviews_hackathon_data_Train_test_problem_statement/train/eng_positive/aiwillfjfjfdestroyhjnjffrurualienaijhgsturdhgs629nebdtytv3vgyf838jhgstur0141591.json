This is, I am pleased to say a very good review. Super customer service/orientation.\nI spoke with Mike about issues I was having with finding binoculars due to wearing glasses and eye relief. Mike spent a long time on the phone with me discussing the issue. Mike took the time to measure the usable eye relief vs the listed.\nVery helpful even after it became apparent I was likely not going to be able to find what I was looking for. My problem not theirs.\nThey know there stuff and better yet treated me in a very professional kind manner. All questions were answered even after it became apparent we were not going to be able to get together to purchase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:21:13.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

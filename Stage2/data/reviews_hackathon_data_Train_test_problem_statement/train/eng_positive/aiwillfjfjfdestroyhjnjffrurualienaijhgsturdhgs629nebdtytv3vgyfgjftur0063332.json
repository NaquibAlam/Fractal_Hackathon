I had been looking for several years for a really nice cabinet for our living room tv. All were very expensive and many were shoddy. I checked the website for Oak Furnitureland and found a lovely cabinet for at least half the price and it was advertised as oak throughout.\nThe ordering process was easy and clear-cut. The feedback communication at every step was immediate and reassuring. The delivery did take place within one month. They gave outstanding communication regarding delivery times, giving options. I knew a week ahead of time the date of delivery...and then I was given a two-hour window of time of delivery...and then a call ten-minutes to let me know they were nearby. The delivery men were courteous and efficient.\nThe cabinet is absolutely beautiful and so well made. We couldn't be happier...not only with the piece of furniture, but with the entire purchasing process.

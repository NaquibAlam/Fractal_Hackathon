I contacted Willis Orchards right away once I knew it was not going to pull through. They sent me a replacement. I had to pay postage (expensive I thought) but it seems that this time I got a cherry tree in great shape - it was better packaged and came in perfect condition. I am very hopeful this one will be perfect. The staff was extremely nice to me. I have never ordered from mail a plant and I was very skeptical that they would believe me when I said it was not living - but that was not the case.

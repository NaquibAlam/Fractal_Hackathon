All of the Silverman's are a class act. I had my mother's 80th birthday celebration here, and it was a wonderful experience. My Interclub Tennis awards luncheon was held here years ago as well. Arcadia High School 50th year class reunion will be held here this summer, and I'm really looking forward to that, Go Titans! I know that I won't be disappointed with this venue. It only gets better here!\nHighly recommend.\nPenni", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T19:41:19.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

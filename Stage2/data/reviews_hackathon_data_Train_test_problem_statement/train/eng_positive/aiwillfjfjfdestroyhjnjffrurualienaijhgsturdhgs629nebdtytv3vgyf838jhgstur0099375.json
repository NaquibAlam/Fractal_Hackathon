All very easy and no problems.\nThen, as arranged the guy came to collect my car. He was very polite and even slightly early.\nMy car received an MOT and passed completely. Therefore didn't have to pay for anything extra and demonstrates they aren't going to make up a Quote: to try to get more money.\nThe same guy then dropped my car back, in the stated time frame. Again he was very polite and I couldn't rate him highly enough.\nThank you so much. Would def recommend to others.

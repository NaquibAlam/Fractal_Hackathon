They are BY FAR the best bang for your buck as far as quality and price. I'm also not very knowledgable on licensing nor copyright law, and I love that they really simplify it for you and make it easy to understand.\nAlso their customer service is great, I mistakenly bought the wrong piece of music a few weeks ago. I figured it would be a huge hassle switching it, but I got somebody on the phone who cleared it up in like 3 minutes completely painlessly.

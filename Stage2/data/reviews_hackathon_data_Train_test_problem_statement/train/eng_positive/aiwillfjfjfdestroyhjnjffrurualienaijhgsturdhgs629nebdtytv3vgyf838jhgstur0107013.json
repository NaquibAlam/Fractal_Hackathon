I was pretty disappointed because I could tell the quality of the leggings were good, but at the bottom there was a cut out that was poorly designed. When I put the leggings on the first time the cut out of a flower at the bottom broke open. I ended up having to send back the entire outfit. I made a mistake when addressing the original return - my fault - and the rep I spoke to when fixing this was excellent and made it easy to correct. When I finally received word that my return had been received I was given a credit because the legging I had originally ordered was either back-ordered or taken off the market (it has since been put back on the website, so I'm thinking maybe they reinforced the weakness in the design of the flower at the base of the leg.)\nAnyway, this whole ordeal has been about a 4 month process, but it hasn't been stressful and in the end I was still able to get what I wanted at a good price.\nOverall, the customer service is exceptional, which makes shopping here worth the expense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T04:24:56.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Our dishwasher was not cleaning properly. We contacted the service department who recommended a certified company into local area to address the matter. I was able to reach the third party that was referred to me and made an appointment based on my availability. The service man arrived within his stated timeframe and investigated the issue. He determined that the dishwasher motor was weak and needed replacement. He then reported it to Choice Home Warranty who reviewed his report, approved the repairs and ordered the new part. The part will arrive within 5 business days and it will then be installed accordingly. This was a very smooth process with no hiccups to report. All parties involved were very courteous and professional and all costs have been covered under the warranty...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:43:13.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

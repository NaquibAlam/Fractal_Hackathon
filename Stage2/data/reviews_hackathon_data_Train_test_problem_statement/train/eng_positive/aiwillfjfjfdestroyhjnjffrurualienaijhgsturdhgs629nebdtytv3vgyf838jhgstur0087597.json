Very convenient and most people were very helpful. One problem was that we would get numerous phone calls with questions that had already been answered to another person. This happened three times. Only other problem was Angie in closing dropped the ball in regards to our closing date. We waited all day on a Saturday just to find out that Angie didn't follow through with her actions to let others know it was happening. The next person who set up our closing did a fantastic job. Overall we are more than satisfied with the whole Quicken Loan process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:20:23.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

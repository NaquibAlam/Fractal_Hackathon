Leaving our beagle in a private home seemed more personable and loving than boarding her in a traditional kennel. Being blind we felt she needed something more personable than a commercial kennel. We were very satisfied with her stay in a private home and felt she couldn't have received better care anywhere else. I am so glad I stumbled on the DogVacay website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T13:14:00.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

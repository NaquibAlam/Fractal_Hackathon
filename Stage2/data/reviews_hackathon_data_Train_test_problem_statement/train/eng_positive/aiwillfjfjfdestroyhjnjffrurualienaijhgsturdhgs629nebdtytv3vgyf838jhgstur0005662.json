Rather than being made to feel as though I should pick one of the engagement rings on display as I had at other jewellery stores, Fay listened to the limited information that I provided and started to present options.\nThey made sure the ring was ready for when I needed to pick it up and it looked perfect. They were then great when it came to resizing the ring at our convenience free of charge.\nI'd highly recommend Marlows to anyone looking to buy jewellery, especially if, like me, you're not sure what you are looking for.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T07:28:50.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

However the arm rest cushion is 9 inches long and the tube is 12 inches long. The person using the chair is 91 and has no padding so the bare part of the tube causes her pain and we had to stop using the chair. We have a fix to add an extended cushion. She will be using it again. She liked the seat and hard back of the chair and the adjustable height. So I think it looks like a good tool for her. The shipping was a little late going out but the communication on that was very good. Overall this was a good choice and Care Prodx easy to deal with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:27:51.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

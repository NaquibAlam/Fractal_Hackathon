The website is very easy to use and within a day I was getting email alerts on the assignments that are available in the Countries I have selected. Have already managed to confirm a few house/pet sits, with opportunities to be their long term sitter each time the owners go on holiday! The home owners are also very hospitable, offered me to food/drinks in their home and did their best to make me feel at home. I love house/pet sitting and take it as a free mini holiday/staycation. Plus, you get to play with awesome pets and meet their lovely owners. Thank you Trustedhousesitters!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T12:57:31.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

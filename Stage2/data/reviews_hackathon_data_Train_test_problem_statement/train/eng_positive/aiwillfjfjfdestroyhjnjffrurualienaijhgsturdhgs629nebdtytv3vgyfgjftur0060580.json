Found a super cute Tory Burch designer pair for about $200 - pricey but not astronomical. But by the time they added up the progressive lenses, the anti-glare, all the bells and whistles - just over $800!! No way! Someone told me that you could order prescription glasses with designer frames online, so I starting Googling and came up with Frames Direct. In less than ten minutes I had the exact frames and lenses picked out that I'd chosen at the store, took a picture of my Rx and emailed it, and my order was on its way. It took about two weeks for them to arrive but I wasn't in a rush. Total price tag: $320. So happy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:56:02.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

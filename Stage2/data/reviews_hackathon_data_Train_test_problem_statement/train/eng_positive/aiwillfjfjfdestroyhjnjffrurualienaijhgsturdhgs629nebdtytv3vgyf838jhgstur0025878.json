I wasn't sure about size. The artist called me to suggest the sizes to me. Since I really didn't know what I was doing here, I trusted them. Over a month later, I received an email asking me to proof the paintings. I was SHOCKED at how real they looked. As soon as they arrived, I showed EVERYONE and they could not believe the oil painting quality, and how I can just place an order on-line for one of the classiest works of art I could find and it actually arrives. I will cherish these FOREVER!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T17:21:24.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

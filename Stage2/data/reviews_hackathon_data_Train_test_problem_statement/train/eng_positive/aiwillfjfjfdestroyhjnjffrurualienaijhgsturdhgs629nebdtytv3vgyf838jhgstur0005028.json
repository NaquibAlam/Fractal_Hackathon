Still they made an effort and delivered the flowers almost within the time frame, which was perfect. I also got 2 sms-s from the company notifying me when the order got on its way to the recepient and when the order had been delivered. I got the two messages one right after the other, so the 1st message was delayed, but that could be due to international mobile operator issues, as it happens sometimes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T05:40:32.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

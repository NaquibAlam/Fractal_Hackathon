Next day on web site was offer for free brake hardware kit. I emailed and asked if I could take advantage of this offer using the code provided. Got a quick response that you would include this with my order. Received the original order VIA UPS on 13 Feb and the hardware kits arrived about 30 min. later by USPS. The order looks to be correct and in great condition. Now just need to install. I am a previous customer from 2011 and have been totally satisfied both times.

She very quickly found excellent low cost policies available to me in my area. She explaiined the basic Medicare coverage in to me detail and answered any of my questions concerning Medicare and supplemental insurance in a direct and understandable manner. She also returned my telephone calls and emails very promptly. Through her I was able to lock in on today's premium even though my coverage begins in August. I would recommend her highly to friends and relatives. The day after the application was done, I received a follow up call from my customer care representative, Mark Dolliver, to inform me that my application was accepted and to let me know that he would be following up with me again in a few months and to call him in the meantime if I had any further questions.

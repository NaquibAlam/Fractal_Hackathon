We left our nursery design to the very last minute, so a week or two before our baby arrived we were sprinting to get everything set up.

Amazing customer service, very understanding of our extenuating circumstances, and overall a fantastic look!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:49:36.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

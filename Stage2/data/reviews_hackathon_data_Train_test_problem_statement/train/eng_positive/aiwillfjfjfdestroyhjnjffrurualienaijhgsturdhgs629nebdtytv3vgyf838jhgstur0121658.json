I wanted to do something special for my son in CA. Called all the local lobster shacks here in Maine, price was just too high. Decide I would get some lobsters from the dock and mail them myself. While searching for shipping containers I came across Maine Lobster Now. Their price for 1.5lb lobsters was consistent with local dock prices the real bonus was shipping cost. Using my corporate account it would have cost almost $350 to ship 40lb package. Maine lobster Now shipped next day, guaranteed alive delivery for less than $100. Interaction with their sales staff was one of the best I have ever experienced. If your looking for fresh Maine lobster give them a try, I'll be using their service from now on!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T04:27:55.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

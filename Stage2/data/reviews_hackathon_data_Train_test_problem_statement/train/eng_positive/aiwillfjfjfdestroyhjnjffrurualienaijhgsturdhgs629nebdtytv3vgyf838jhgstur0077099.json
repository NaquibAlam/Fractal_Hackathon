He recommended L&M flooring with recommedation of specific type of vinyl that was reasonably priced and had not been found in any other locations that he frequented. I was greeted by Misty and she took me to that section of the store and immediately assisted with ideas of how it could be used and allowed me to take three samples to my home to see it in the products in my environment . Before I left the store she had estimates available and also recommended other folks to help with projects that L&M would not be able to service.\nShe even recommended ways that would help me save money using their own service that allowed for the cost to be covered by my homeowner's insurance had allotted to me. This assistance allowed me to purchase and have installed an additional area that was not covered by my homeowner's insurance and now I have a completed look. L&M has such a wide selection of products that I was able to get a laminate hard wood look and vinyl all in one stop and both were installed as they had appointments available that were convenient for my schedule. L& M's installers were very courteous and efficient they even assisted with things that I didn't think I would be able to do on my own. The final product is gorgeous and I'm very pleased with the outcome. I can certainly say that the renovations that they assisted me with have added much needed value to my home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T18:18:01.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It's such a relief to know that 3 dinners a week are taken care of (or up to 5, if you so choose). They are nutritious, easy to make, reasonably fast to make, and restaurant-quality meals. We've used similar services before but I like this one best. There's great variety, not a constant stream of kale and collard greens (both of which I like, but not every single week), and the meals come packaged in individual boxes that are shaped to fit easily into your refrigerator. The even have a vegetarian option, if that's your thing. I totally would recommend that anyone at least try it out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:39:00.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When it was received, it was not as I had envisioned. The return process was very easy, and hassle free, which I appreciated. I have just placed an order for compact binoculars, which look like a better option to fill my needs. I had confidence to place this 2nd order with B&H because of how they treated me when I returned the first item.\nDave", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:22:19.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

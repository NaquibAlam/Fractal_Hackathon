Without being pushy and with concise guidance, AnnuityAdvantage moved as quickly as I think is possible to send me sample policy wording, answer questions, complete the application and then forward the policy packets and policy-receipt acknowledgements to me.\nIn one instance, the representative, upon inquiring about the insurer's upcoming rate change at a time when the insurer had already received my check but hadn't yet issued a policy, learned that the rate was going to be increased in four days and quickly advised me that I could request (if I did so that day) the insurer, via the representative, to hold the check until the effective date of the new rate, which I did and which increased guaranty-period interest by $745.\nI came to learn of AnnuityAdvantage through their website, which lists the many insurer offerings of deferred annuities ranging between 3-year and 10-year guaranty periods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:45:57.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

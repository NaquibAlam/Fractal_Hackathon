He explained in simple terms the details of everything that was wrong. He prioritised honestly what was critical for my car and what could wait then went to work with passion on getting it fixed for me the same day.\nNot only did he fix my car but he took the time to clean the parts of my engine as he went. I haven't seen it look this good in years. Johnny is not just a skilled mechanic but takes pride in his work. He was a pleasure to deal with & I look forward to using him again in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T15:16:53.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This is all very well except we had to hope that there were no traffic jams/holdups to empty the tank before finding a petrol station!\nThe man who served us was very matter of fact and serious and obviously tired. The other gentleman (who served the lady) was smiling, friendly and very accommodating.\nThe young man ( Majic ?) who actually handed over the car and was there when we dropped it off, was very pleasant and helpful.\nBecause of the price we would use the Company again and hope that there's a decent amount of petrol available!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T09:52:39.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

While the item itself wasn't what I was looking for in the end, it arrived less than 24 hours after ordering, and I didn't even get charged for fast delivery. When I returned it, my money got refunded within a few hours of the item arriving with them and they've been friendly throughout. My only small criticism is that the instructions to return on their website are a bit misleading; it stated I needed to create an account and would find a returns label option in order history; when in fact my order history was empty after creating an account and it was perfectly sufficient to just write on the enclosed invoice that came with the item. That was a bit unnecessary and time consuming as I had to call the shop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:50:36.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

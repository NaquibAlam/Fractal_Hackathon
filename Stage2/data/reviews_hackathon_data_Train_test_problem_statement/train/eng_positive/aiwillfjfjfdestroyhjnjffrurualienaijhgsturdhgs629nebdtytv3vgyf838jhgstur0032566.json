Gigmasters made it easy and convenient for me to do it all online. The process was awesome and I felt very comfortable booking through them since they did garentee their events. They contacted me swiftly and asked what I was looking for and within 48 hours I had 3 Quote: s from vendors. I selected Little Big Band since they sounded great online and gave me a great Quote: . After speaking with Greg Anderson I knew that they would be a terrific fit for me. My mother played in a swing band in her younger years and at 90 continues to play piano at area nursing homes. Music is her life and when Greg assured me that mom could play along with them, it clinched the deal. The bithday was awesome and the band certainly delivered everything that was asked of them and more. Mom is still talking about the best birthday party that she has ever had. Thankyou gigmaster and Little Big Band!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T11:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T13:02:10.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

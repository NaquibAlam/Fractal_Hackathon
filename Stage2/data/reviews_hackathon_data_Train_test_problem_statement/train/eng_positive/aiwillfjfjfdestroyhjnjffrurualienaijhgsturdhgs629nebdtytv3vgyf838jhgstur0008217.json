I used to send tons of emails daily to ask questions and make sure that the dress will be exactly like the picture and the emails was being replied very professionally and in a very friendly way. I kept being worried about the dress until I have received it (two days before the date that was given to me) and it was exactly like the picture with the exact measurements I gave to them, nothing different, nothing less (only more fabric of the dress in case I needed more). I ordered a veil with the dress without seeing a picture or sending a picture of it, all I did was sending a picture of the length I wanted. I would like to thank all the staff members and tell them that you did a great job and made me super happy with my perfect wedding dress and a special thanks to Karasui who was emailing me almost everyday until I received my dress. Thank you all so much and I'm sure I will order more dresses from you again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:58:06.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We had no idea how our kids would be for a long flight Iike that, what the prices could be, how many planes we would have to catch and if there would be layovers or not. When I signed up for email alerts to help us find our dream vacation unfold I got an alert on my iPad at 5 am. Something told me to open my emails so I did and that was when we booked out flights. Direct from Vancouver to Amsterdam and at a price that was a few hundred each under what we were finding on our on and the dates we wanted to go and come back! The flight was great, our 9 yr old who never sits still for more than 10 mins was so content with what was going on it helped our dream vacation to be a success. We signed him up for the kids flight club which keep him entertained as well as the free headphones for watching movies and music, it was perfect! The service was great, the flight was awesome and we will have memories to last us a life time! Thank you flighthub!!!! I will always use flighthub from now on for all my flight bookings, in fact I just booked my second flight with flighthub for myself and 2 sisters to fly out to a family wedding in Manitoba and at an amazing price once again! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èLove flighthub üõ´üóºüè∞üåÜüõ¨", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:06:50.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

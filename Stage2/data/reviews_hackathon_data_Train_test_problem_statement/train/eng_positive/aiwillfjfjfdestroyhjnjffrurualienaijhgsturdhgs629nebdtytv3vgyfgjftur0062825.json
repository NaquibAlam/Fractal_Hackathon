All I found was made in China and poor quality at a very expensive price. Then I thought this is silly, being a expat from NZ see if I could find something reasonable from there. The website was very easy to navigate. To my surprise I found a less expensive pair of slippers from NZ made in NZ than I could buy here in the US. I was concerned about the exchange rate, gst, shipping, returning and customs. But after reading all the details that all this was included, I said to myself well go and checkout and see what happens. Boy was I surprised! No exchange rate difference on my credit card. No customs paperwork I had to fill out. The product fit perfectly and quality is fantastic. And from the time of ordering to the time of receiving the item was five days in a padding envelope with the customs doc. attached. I will definitely purchase more items in the future. Thanks NZ Sheepskins!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:40:24.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

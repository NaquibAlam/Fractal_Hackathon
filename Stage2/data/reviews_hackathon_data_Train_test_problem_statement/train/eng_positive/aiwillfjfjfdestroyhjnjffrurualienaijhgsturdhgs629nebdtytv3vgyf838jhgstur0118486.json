Which is wonderful for how quickly my child was growing out of his other bed. Everything looks good and the bed is solid compared to others that seem to wiggle and have a lot of instability. I was looking for something that could handle being climbed on and rocked and jostled because my boys are very active. For the price and look of this bed I couldn't be happier. It was a wonderful purchase. The bed isn't going to tip over and i don't feel like the are going to warp the frame anytime soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:17:35.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I had been going back and forth with the IRS for years and right from the start the professionals at Optima Tax Relief assessed my situation and put me completely at ease. They explained the entire process in detail so I could easily understand what all stages would look like. Everyone that handled my case was always accessible for any questions I had via phone or email. They also designated a point person to have a periodic \"touch base\" with me so I would be kept in the loop at all stages. They were extremely efficient and transparent explaining possible outcomes. Because we started the process late in the year it took a bit longer then expected(the government offices shut we down during the holidays). The final outcome was OPTIMA TAX RELIEF saved me tens of THOUSANDS of dollars and continued back and forth with the IRS. I was completely lost and overwhelmed but OPTIMA TAX RELIEF stepped in and took control of the entire situation. Excellent experience from beginning to end I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:59:37.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

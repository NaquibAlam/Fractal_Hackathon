Hardy called me instantly and told me what happened. So the original day I was leaving was more expensive and he was able to give it to me for a lower price. Like $450 less than what I would have originally paid. He was able to make the changes and did an awesome job in assuring me of the new changes. Everything is booked and we're all ready to go! Definitely would refer this website for your traveling needs. Thanks again Hardy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:00:31.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

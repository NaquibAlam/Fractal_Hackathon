Each agent advised me that prospective buyers prefer to buy through experienced agents and not through the owner, advising me that I didn't have the skills to negotiate a sale, and that a rural acreage property can be difficult to sell. I simply could not connect with the agents, and after researching on line, I believed I was the person who knew this home, so we made the decision to sell privately through Property Now.\nIn my situation, each prospective buyer who came to inspect our property, were prepared with questions, I knew the right person would come through the door, and so I was prepared to answer all questions honestly, being available to extend more information to the buyers also gave me the connection with the buyer.\nWe sold our small acre property through Property Now, the whole process was easy to follow, I used a cheap camera, I took a step back and revised each photo, I was particular in the details of each photo, being sure to remove any unsightly items.\nWhen I contacted Property Now with any questions, they always conducted themselves in a professional and helpful manner. I was never left unsure on how to handle anything.\nWe have been very happy with this sale, met some lovely people along the way, and highly recommend Property Now.\nI so enjoyed this experience that I wish I had another property to sell. Thankyou to Andrew and all the team, it's your dedication which makes the teamwork successful for all, nothing was a problem.\nBoth Solicitors, made positive comments on the ease of the process.\nOh by the way .... I must have some skills, because the property sold for the asking price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T20:57:53.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

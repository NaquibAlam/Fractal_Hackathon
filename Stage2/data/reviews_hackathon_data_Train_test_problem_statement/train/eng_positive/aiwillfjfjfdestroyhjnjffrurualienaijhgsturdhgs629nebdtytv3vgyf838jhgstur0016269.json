I find that the handling of contacts and helping remove contacts is something they can do better. Ours is a Children's play center, so as the children get older the client is not going to be interested anymore, unless they have a second child, so the ability to remove emails based on entry date is something that might be a good option. I know that we can remove emails addresses that do not open by sorting through open email list, but it is time consuming anyways I started digressing. Its a good service, pricey? but what is not now a days!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T22:32:56.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

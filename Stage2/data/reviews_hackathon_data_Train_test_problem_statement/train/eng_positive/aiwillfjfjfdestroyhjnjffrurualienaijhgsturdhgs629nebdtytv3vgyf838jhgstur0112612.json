As I was preparing for another trip in two months, I looked at Flight Hub and asked to have an \"Alert Bulletin\" put in place for my next trip.\nWith only two months before my next venture, I know over the past 4+ decades of commercial aviation that rates RARELY decrease, but increase the closer one gets to the departure date.\nMy first notice was in line with Expedia.com, offering the same slightly reduced prices for the various flights. The next notice had a $40 decrease, which surprised me, as well as beating the competition. Today, I got another notification with another decrease of over $50! It is now almost at the same cost as a one-way ticket for round trip fares. Obviously, I booked it and am relieved I could save a great deal of money, especially as I am a senior citizen with only 3/4 Social Security for my income.\nThank you, FlightHub, for finding the best rates on the market!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:30:25.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It has saved me countless hours over the course of time, and I am less stressed when I look at email. That alone is worth my subscription fee, which itself is very reasonable.\nLonger review:\nI am a very busy sales professional, but home life is pretty crazy too with 5 kids and I also coach soccer.\nBefore I started using SaneBox my email inboxes were inundated with junk newsletters, advertisements, and just useless emails. I have many accounts, and two that are primary accounts (one for personal and one for work). I had used Unrollme to try and clear out most of the clutter, but Unrollme requires you to sift through senders and pick and choose what you want to remove. You have to do this manual process regularly if you truly want to keep things clean. Then I heard about SaneBox and used the free trial and realized that SaneBox handles all of this in an automated fashion!! No more manually picking and choosing which senders matter. If it puts something in your SaneLater, or other SaneFolders, and you want that to come to your inbox instead, simply move it to your inbox and you just trained SaneBox to put it in your inbox in the future. The same applies in the reverse!\nI use many of SaneBox's folders so News gets sorted differently from Bulk. This means my inbox almost always only contains emails that I have to address in an ASAP manner. My SaneLater folder contains stuff I don't need to worry about until I have more time, and then the SaneNews folder gets looked at when I have some free time. The SaneBulk folder is generally stuff I can delete, but allows me to dig into something if it looks interesting.\nNow my inboxes are focused because they only contain what I need to deal with. This has saved me countless hours and has kept my inbox clean so I can stay focused on what matters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:08:07.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

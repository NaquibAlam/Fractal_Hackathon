As they were a VW Passat they can have two fixings and unable to check exactly which fixings were correct I took a guess and ....ordered the wrong ones.

The mats are a perfect fit and excellent quality and very good value for money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T12:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:20:58.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We arranged day-tours, long-distance shuttles and TWO small-ship cruises which turned out to be outstanding experiences!\nWe were assisted by Michael, in Toronto, who always responded promptly, had in-depth knowledge of the Patagonia region, and was sensitive to our financial issues. GoWay has a long history in South America and it shows -- anyone can research hotels on their own these days, but GoWay provides you with the details and comparisons about transportation and activities that only comes from \"being there\". Expect your travel planner to have put feet-on-the-ground at your destination -- GoWay does that.\nWould recommend GoWay to anyone planning a trip to S. America -- you can use them for the whole package or just have them recommend and book small pieces of your journey.

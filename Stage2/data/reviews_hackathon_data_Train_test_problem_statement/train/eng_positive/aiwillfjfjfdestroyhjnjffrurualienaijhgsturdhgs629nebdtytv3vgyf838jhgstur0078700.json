MobileZap seemed the best local company to fulfill my order as they offered the best price/delivery for my chosen product. From placement of order through to delivery they were excellent in that receipts, delivery communications & follow up were there in a timely manner. Had some initial setup problems for which I was ably assisted by MobileZap support staff. Overall a most satisfying purchase, probably one of the best online transactions I've ever experienced. Thanks MobileZap.\nRegards\nRod McNeil", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:55:58.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

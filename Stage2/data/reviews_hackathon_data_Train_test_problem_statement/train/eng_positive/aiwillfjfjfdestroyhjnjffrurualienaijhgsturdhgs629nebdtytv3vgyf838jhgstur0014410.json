It may not work for everyone, but if you are reasonably disciplined, it works. I used Nutrisystem years ago and lots almost 60 pounds, but over many year (over 10), I find I need to come back and lose some of what I gained. Nutriystem has improved a great deal in the intervening years. The frozen entrees and desserts are great and a big improvement. Still lots of favorites from before, like the lasagna and cinnamon bun bars, but many new ones like the turkey medallions with mashed potatoes. But where is my barbeque with rice entree??", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:43:15.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The Servcorp team has a balance of being professional, personal, friendly, and accommodating that I've never seen in another company of any sort before. Whether I had a random or sporadic issue come up from things like expecting a check in the mail, a conference room, or flexibility around payment, the Servcorp team always put my interests first and helped me resolve every issue as soon as I reached out. If I ever have another business opportunity come up where I would need office space, they would be the first call I make and I would recommend them to any friend, family member, or colleague. THANK YOU AGAIN SERVCORP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:33:04.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

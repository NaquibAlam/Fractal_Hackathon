On February 7 I odered everything and the roses arrived today (February 14) very early and on time around 10:30am in an amazing quality.\nEveryone who wants to see a picture of the roses can send me a message!\nI'm impressed in a positive way and will keep FloraQueen in the back of my mind for more upcoming events. I can only recommend the delivery of flowers through FloraQueen!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:49:13.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

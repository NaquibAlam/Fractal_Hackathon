I thought I was buying a cotton flag, when the flag arrived the cotton part was the white border of\nthe flag. The flag itself is made out of a combination of materials almost\nas if it is covered in a sizing material. I am hoping that this will make the flag more durable as I plan on flying outside on the appropriate holidays.\nI have a 5X8 flag made from cotton , the material is much heavier, softer and you can't see through it the way you can the 3X5 purchased from American Flag. On the white bunting it says \"bunting made from 100% cotton\".\nThe 5X8 was purchased from American Flags several years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:32:17.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

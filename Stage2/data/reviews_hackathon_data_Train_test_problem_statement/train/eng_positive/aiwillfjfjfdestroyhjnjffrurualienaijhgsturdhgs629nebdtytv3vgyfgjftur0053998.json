Talk about mindfullness the varying intensity of the lead lines is an authentic joy to view.\nTotally affirmed my love for art. I used a 16x20 simple silver frame with a double white mat. Looks awesome I placed in my dining room on an easel. Unforgettable/everlasting stimulus. The personized hand written note from Mr. Jover was an especially sweet touch. The drawing journeyed all the way from Australia to my country home in Iowa/USA.

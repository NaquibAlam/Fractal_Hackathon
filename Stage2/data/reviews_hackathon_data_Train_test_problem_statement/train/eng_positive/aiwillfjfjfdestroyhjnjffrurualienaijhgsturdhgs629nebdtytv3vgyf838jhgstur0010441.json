We chose Omega based on their good prices and excellent reviews. Expected a car a few years old, but were provided with a brand new Toyota Corolla, which gave no trouble on our 4000km tour. The Omega staff at both locations were friendly, efficient and helpful. No hassle, no hidden extras - altogether a great stress-free experience.Thank you for a wonderful service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:05:28.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

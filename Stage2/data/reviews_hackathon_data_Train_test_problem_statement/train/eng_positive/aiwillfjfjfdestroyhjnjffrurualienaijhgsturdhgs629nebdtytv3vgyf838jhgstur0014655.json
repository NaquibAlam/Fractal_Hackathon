However, I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every meal I have cooked since subscribing over 2 months ago. Some are a little better than others, but there are a lot of exotic new flavors that some people will appreciate more than others. I have never considered myself great in the kitchen, but now I feel like I am a good cook!! My husband is loving it as well. Only once was an ingredient missing (well not missing just not enough of) and as soon as I contacted customer service they promptly credited back my payment. I have never had a problem with the quality of the ingredients", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T14:15:16.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Initially I was frustrated, as the web service hung up, never taking me to the confirmation screen. I waited for a few minutes to see if I would receive an e-mail to confirm my reservation or if I would need to resubmit the online form. Within a few minutes I received a phone call from the El Camino Blvd. location thanking me for my reservation and walking me through the account setup process, as well as confirming my rate. The person who called (Melissa) was very friendly and professional, answering all my questions. While talking with her, I also received e-mail confirmation of my reservation. Despite the initial problems with the website, my interaction with the staff has been stellar! Their helpful, pleasant attitude makes it a pleasure to use their facility for my storage needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:35:34.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

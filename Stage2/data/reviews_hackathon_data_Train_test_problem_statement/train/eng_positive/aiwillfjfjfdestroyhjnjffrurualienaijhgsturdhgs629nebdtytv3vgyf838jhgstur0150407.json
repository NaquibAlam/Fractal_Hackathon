It went back and forth for over a week to my disappointment and frustration until Jennifer C the Operations Manager stepped in and diffused the situation and made it right. As soon as she was aware of the situation she was on top of it and was giving me immediate service and it felt as though I was the only client that mattered. She called, emailed and followed up repeatedly and made sure that I was given what I needed to right the wrong. Although the purchase went downhill from when I received the package damaged from the shipper, Jennifer C most definitely was the one who turned this all around into a win on her part. I must commend her for her commitment to excellent service. Thanks Jennifer C! Frames Direct could benefit with more of you or have you be in charge of training others. Your customer service skills are what will build your company's reputation. Thank you again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:55:36.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

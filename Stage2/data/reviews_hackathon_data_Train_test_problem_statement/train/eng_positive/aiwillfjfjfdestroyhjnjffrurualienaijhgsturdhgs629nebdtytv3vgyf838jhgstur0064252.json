It definitely gives me that edge to stand out. I always get so many compliments. However, there are many dresses that fall in the category of the thinner, more fragile side and I prefer the thicker fabrics as oppose to the thinner ones when it comes to deciding what to buy for dresses. I am around mostly children and they want to touch and/or feel everything so it is imperative that my clothes are durable and versatile yet still look amazing.

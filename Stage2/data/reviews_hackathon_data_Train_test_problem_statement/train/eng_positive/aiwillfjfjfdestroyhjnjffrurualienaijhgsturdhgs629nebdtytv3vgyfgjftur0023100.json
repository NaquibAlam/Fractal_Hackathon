The set up of my 4 arm press was super easy and took me about 30 min, mostly because I was gawking at all my new tools and toys. Feels solidly built. When going to mix my emulsion it felt stiff and different from the training video so I called Ryonet. They told me that it probably froze in shipping and before I could say anything else they rushed me a fresh one. Amazing! They are super fast and friendly. Ill definately buy from them again when I need additional stuff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T23:19:09.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I've been purchasing all my pet supplies from them for about 2 years now, and I am always amazed by their product selection, incredibly low prices, and top notch customer support. And it's so much more convenient having everything shipped to your door (for free) instead of lugging all those heavy items home from a store. I recommend Chewy to everyone... I'll never buy my pet supplies anywhere else!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T15:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:10:13.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

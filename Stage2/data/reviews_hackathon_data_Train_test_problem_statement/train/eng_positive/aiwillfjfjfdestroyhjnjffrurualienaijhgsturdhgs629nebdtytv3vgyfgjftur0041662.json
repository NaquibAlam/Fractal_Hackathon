I've been using RentalCars for around 5 years now and each time it is a pleasure.\nI learned early on that RentalCars includes in each short car description, whether the car is at the airport rental centre (easy) or off somewhere, a bus-ride away (pain in the neck!)\nIt now takes me around 5 mins to book a car as I know what I'm doing.\nNo matter what crazy advertising I see now, I ignore and hear to RentalCars. I DID get caught there a few years ago and believed Ryanair when they said they had the most fantastic deal â€“ I ended up with such a pile of extras that I was cured forever of industry spin.\nRentalCars has never let me down and I'm sticking with them.\nBTW, I have NOTHING to do with them.

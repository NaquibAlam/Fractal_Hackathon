Finally, I came across an elegant black and gold Skagen on Jomashop. It was exactly what I was looking for and something I couldn't find elsewhere - including on the Skagen website. Furthermore, when compared to other Skagen products from other websites it was extremely good value - saving me money even after the cost of shipping and customs. Needless to say my girlfriend was delighted with her watch and I was delighted with the fantastic deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:02:17.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was very easy to fill out everything but at the end of my reservation I came across and error ID that asked me to call customer service as soon as possible. So I called them and was on hold for about 30 minutes. It was late at night already so I decided I would just call back in the morning. When morning came around I called and was now on hold for 15 minutes just trying to speak with a live person. Finally a lady picked up and she let me know my reservation did not go through and she would be able to walk me through my reservation. We finally got everything filled out to how I wanted it to be. She asked to put me on hold as the reservation was being processed. When she picked the phone back up she told me there was something wrong with the air flight portion and that I had to pay $450 more to secure the fight. At this point I was already irritated and asked if she would not able to see if there was any other flights that would be included into what the original price was. She told me there was no available flights but there was 1 that we would be able to switch to for 50 per person but landing later than the time you were suppose to check into the hotel. I told her I would just call back later but to secure the reservation for the hotel. Around 4 pm that day I called back and a guy named Philip answered my call in about 2 minutes. He helped me with my flight and got me onto the original flight but for $50 more per person instead of what the lady that I was speaking earlier to for $450 more. I was pleased and agreed. I finally have my reservation all set and couldn't be more happier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T02:13:42.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It's not common, in my experience, to find competant and interested customer service even for significant purchasing decisions with many vendors and companies. This experience was really a good one. My experience with OfficeWonderland was fast, professional, and top notch from start to finish. I appreciated the sales expert asking me questions to narrow the options to my needs up front, then comparing the difference efficiently and finalizing the sale and shipping within minutes.

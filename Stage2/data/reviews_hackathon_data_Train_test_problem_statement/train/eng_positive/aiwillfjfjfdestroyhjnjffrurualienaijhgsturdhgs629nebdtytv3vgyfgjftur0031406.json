They are sturdy and the best on the market. This review would have received 5 stars (I almost rated this a 3) if the packaging would have been better. For such an important instrument as these levels I would expect better packaging for shipping. The levels just had a single layer of cardboard protecting them and that cardboard was punctured in one place and bent in another and partially opened. I checked the levels and they seem to have arrived safely despite the poor packaging.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:25:14.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

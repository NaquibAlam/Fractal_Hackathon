I canceled my phone coverage from my provider and was shopping for independent insurance companies that offered a comprehensive coverage and didn't charge arm and leg for it.\nSo I found eSuranty.com!\nThe enrollment process was super easy and fast. I paid for a year, up front, a lot less than the monthly payments would have cost me. There is even lesser amount to pay if you choose 2 years option.\nThough I hope I will never need their services, I'll be back to renew my policy.\nHighly recommend for an independent cellphone and tablet insurance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T21:16:38.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

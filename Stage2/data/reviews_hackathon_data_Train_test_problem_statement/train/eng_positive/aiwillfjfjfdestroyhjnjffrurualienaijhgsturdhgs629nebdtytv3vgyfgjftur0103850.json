I had absolutely no experience trying to sell anything other than a garage sale. Sue Curry was amazing (and her coworkers as well.) She immediately put me at ease, explained everything that she was doing while she was doing it (weighing, researching, explaining pricing,making a call to double check her work!). I never felt for one moment that I wasn't in great hands or that I wasn't getting a fair deal. She acted like every thing I showed her was as important to her as it was to me. She even gave me advice on selling other items that they didn't take at her company . On top of a wonderful experience I walked out with a few thousand dollars!!! In addition, she has contacted me on 2 separate occasions to give me leads of other companies that might want to purchase items I had that her company doesn't get involved in!!! Who does that anymore?!? I have never been so impressed by the service she has given me. So above and beyond the call of duty! I would not hesitate again going back to Sue and her associates. The last thing I want to add is shortly after I left PGS, I contacted an antique company to show them additional things I had to sell. I had a lot of confidence after dealing with Sue that everyone would be so terrific. NOT SO. After I left him and sold a couple of pieces I felt terribly ripped off and disappointed. He made me feel like everything I was showing was worthless. So there really is a difference in the place you go and the honesty and integrity of a business and their employees. I cannot say enough nice things about this firm. Thank you Sue!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T19:07:07.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

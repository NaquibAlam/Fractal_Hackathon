It wasn't getting rid of ads. I emailed customer support and expected to wait a week or so and then get a response that was less than useful, as this has been my previous experience with many other software companies. Boy, was I surprised, and pleasantly so! I got an almost immediate reply, which told me to change a setting, and also provided me with a website which accurately and clearly explained what to do. The settings change fixed the issue and now it works perfectly. I am delighted with the program, which does what it says, and also with Adguard's customer support, which is stellar!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:01:45.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

If a problem ever does arise- you can count on the service department to hold your hand and take care of you the whole way by recommending something similar and then ensuring it is delivered to the right person on time as well. I've had an issue come up at 10pm on a Sunday and couldn't believe the online service, it's courtesy, and promptness. I can't say enough about ezcater and recommend them without reservation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T23:02:59.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

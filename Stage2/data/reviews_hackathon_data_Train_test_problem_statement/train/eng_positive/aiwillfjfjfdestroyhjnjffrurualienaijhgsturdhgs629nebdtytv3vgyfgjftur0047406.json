I went in cautious as their are so many negatively written reviews and to be honest all that did was make me pay more in shipping because I didn't want to place a large order with no past experience with the company. While my overall experience has been great with them it is worth mentioning that their economy shipping utilizes ups smart post meaning they hand off the package to local usps for final delivery. Do yourselves a favor and either wait till you need more then a few small items and place a 100$+ order as they often offer free shipping at that point and you can choose ups final delivery and get your order on time. If that is not an option and you want a guarantee of timely delivery with accurate tracking pay the extra 5$ for upgraded delivery. I have used economy delivery and had no serious issues aside from delays after usps got there hands on the package, while I still received the items they were almost always 2+ days behind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:06:04.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

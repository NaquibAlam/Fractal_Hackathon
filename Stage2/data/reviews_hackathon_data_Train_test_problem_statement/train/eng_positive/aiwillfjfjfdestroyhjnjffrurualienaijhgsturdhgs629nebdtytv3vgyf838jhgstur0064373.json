The site itself runs very well and the assistance from staff (email, telephone or on line chat) is always obtainable and the staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. My recent house sits have been achieved because of trust - mutual trust from the home owner and the house sitter - and I believe this is because of the website and that people feel assured they can offer a house sitter to stay in their home, and often look after their pets, without having even met the house sitter. The security is gained from the reviews on the web site, the personal information the house sitter provides, the references, and the security checks. I have had very enjoyable house sits, and met wonderful people through Trusted House Sitters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:51:02.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I bought my son a desk top mac for Xmas 2016 and its been great. It runs like a dream and looks bran new! No problems love it so much that I need to buy myself one. When I was trying to pick out the best Mac for my son your company was very helpful and answered all the questions I needed to pick what would be best suited for our son. Thanks so much will be buying from you again !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T18:38:42.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

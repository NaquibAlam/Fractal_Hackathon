From this point on, it really was the attention to detail that set Jacada apart. Rather than a simple itinerary, we were sent a link to a personal website that had our itinerary set up, with photos of the places we'd stay, the things we'd see. It was easy to tweak the itinerary to adjust for our preferences, and the price was competitive with booking each component of the trip myself, without any of the hassle.\nWhen we arrived in Ecuador, we were greeted at the airport and transferred to our hotel. The next day, the same guide and driver picked us up at the hotel and took us on a half day city tour. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable, spoke excellent English, and was greeted with hugs and kisses at every site we visited - it felt very much like we were on a VIP tour.\nAt every hotel, there was a hand written note from Jacada, personally addressed and wishing us a pleasant stay.\nMy only criticism is that you can't book bits and pieces through Jacada - it was an all or nothing service. We'd booked accommodation in Mendoza separately and I would have loved to have Jacada organise our local tours whilst we were in the area, but on inquiry, that wasn't an option, which was disappointing. I can understand why they wouldn't want to solely arrange tours as a service, but given we'd spent a considerable amount with Jacada on the Galapogas itinerary, I would have expected them to extend the same level of service to the rest of our itinerary, irrespective of whether the accommodation was booked through Jacada or not.\nHaving said that, we are planning our next vacation and I will definitely see what Jacada can offer for our trip to Europe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:10:42.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

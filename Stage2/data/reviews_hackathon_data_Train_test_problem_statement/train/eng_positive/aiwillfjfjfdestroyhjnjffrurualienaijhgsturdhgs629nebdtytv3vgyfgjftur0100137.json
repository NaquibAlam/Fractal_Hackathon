For the most part they've been helpful and great and have been really good to work with. The products have always been what I was looking for and great.\nI would love to give them 5 stars, but about a month ago when I went to buy a camera that had a B&H Gift card promotion, I was traveling and the day B&H opened again, the promotion was gone when I went to check out. I called to see if they could honor it, and they said the couldn't... I was a bit disappointed as it was literally in the first few hours after the change took place, and making the sale with them would make me less hesitant about buying another camera in the future...

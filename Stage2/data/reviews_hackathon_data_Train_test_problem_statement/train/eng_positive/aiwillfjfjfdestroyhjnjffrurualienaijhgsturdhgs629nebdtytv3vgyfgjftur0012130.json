There is no other site that could compare to Thrift Books prices. Depending on the condition you buy the book in, it's nicer then you would expect it to be. In my search for each book I wanted, I have not encounter the problem where they did not have the book, which is surprising to me since other book sites don't have the book I'm looking for. Books I ordered also came in within a week, shipping in a recyclable paper package right in front of my door. Thrift Books is a site I will always come back too for books for days to come as it is the best website to buy books in my opinion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T15:26:05.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I chatted to Alisha, who helped me make all the right decisions and preached the features and benefits of my 2016 Mitsubishi Mirage.\nAlisha was kind enough to push for a next day pickup, something that I knew was very unlikely. To my surprise, Alisha and the team at Moorooka pulled it together and I was able to pick up my new car within 24 hours of applying for a loan.\nI highly recommend Motorama for future services to anyone in need, and I am genuinely grateful that I had such excellent service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:37:35.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

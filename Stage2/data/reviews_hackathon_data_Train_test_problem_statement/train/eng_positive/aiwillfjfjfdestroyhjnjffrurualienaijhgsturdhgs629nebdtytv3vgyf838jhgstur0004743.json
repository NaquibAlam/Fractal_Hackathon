We had seen some dresses on the Prom Girl Site, but were afraid the material would be cheap, the sizing wouldn't match up, it wouldn't be here in time. PROM GIRL is an amazing site, the dresses are reasonably priced, and you have a great selection od sale dresses. The lace fabric is Absolutely beautiful, the rhinestones and jewels are good quality, and the tulle skirt is so pretty and full. The sizing was perfect. The dress came in 4 days, no extra postage.. We are very pleased we ordered from you, have shared the site with friends, and will look on your site first. Thank you for making a young girl look like a princess.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:42:16.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

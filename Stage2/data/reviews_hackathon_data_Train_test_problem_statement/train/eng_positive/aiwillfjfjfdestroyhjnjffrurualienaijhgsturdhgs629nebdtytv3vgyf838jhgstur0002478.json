I had to modify one of the holes to fit the bike, but was easy using a 3/8\" drill. The only problem is the bag won't open all the way because I have an oversized seat on the back. They are functional and look great, so I decided to use them anyway. One suggestion, you really need to have two people to install, one to hold the bag while the other is marking and mounting. So far, really nice bag for the money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T20:22:08.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

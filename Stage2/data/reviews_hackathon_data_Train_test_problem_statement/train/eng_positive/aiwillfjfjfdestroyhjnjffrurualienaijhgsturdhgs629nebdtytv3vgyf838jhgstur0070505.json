She answered all our questions and came up with a great package for our travel. Our flight, transfers and accommodations were flawless. We took her suggestion and stayed at the Riu Republica Adult only hotel. Our visit was wonderful. The hotel was spotless and lovely. The staff was friendly and accommodating in every capacity. The food and dining was fresh and varied. I enjoyed the Asian restaurant , the Steak house was less than expected. Pretty much a perfect vacation for us. Beautiful pools, grounds and beach, wonderful people. We could be as active or relaxed as wanted in the moment. Thanks, Maegan and Blue Sun vacations . I have already booked my next trip for the end of March. HAPPY TRAVELER.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T07:27:03.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

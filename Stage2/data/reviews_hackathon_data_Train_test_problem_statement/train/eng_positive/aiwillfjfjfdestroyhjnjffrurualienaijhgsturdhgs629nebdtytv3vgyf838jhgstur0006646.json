We received our check within a few days along with a nice letter. I'd recommend this insurance to anybody with a pet that they love. You will be able to save money by having this type of insurance for any emergency that comes up. This is the first time we had an emergency with Cookie, and we were so worried about her that at the time we'd do anything to save her from the pain she was in. Thank goodness for the knowledgeable Veterinarian and assistants at the Animal Urgent Care in Mission Viejo and her great Veterinarian, Dr, Margolis who helped her back to health. And a big Thank You \"Pets Best\" for helping us out with the bills which were very expensive, especially since we are both on Social Security. This proved to us what a great pet health insurance can do for you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:27:47.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

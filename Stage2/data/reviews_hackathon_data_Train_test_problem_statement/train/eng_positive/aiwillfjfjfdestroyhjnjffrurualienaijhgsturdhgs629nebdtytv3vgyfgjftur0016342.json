They pay for shipping costs and pay you very promptly. I'm now a BIG fan of this company! ( And if you try their service you will be too.) I couldn't be happier with the process and experience of dealing with sellbackyourbook.com. They are wonderful! I say this honestly and frankly. My only wishes would be that the books I sold them were worth more to them (payout wise) and that they wanted more of the books I had to sell. But I don't hold them responsible for these wishes. Brillant company! I\"d give them 10 stars if I could!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T13:35:22.291+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

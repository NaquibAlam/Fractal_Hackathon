However, you were kind enough to reach out to me after I wrote my first review to let me know that you had refunded the price of one of the orders. That kind of integrity and commitment to customer satisfaction is, sadly, rare.\nI truly appreciate your staff being to accommodating and for ensuring that I was made aware that you had refunded the price for one of the purchases.\nI look forward to doing further business with you in the near future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:23:50.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

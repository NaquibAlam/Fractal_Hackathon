I LOVE Bandzoogle! The templates are highly customizable and beautiful, it's really user-friendly, and the support team is great: thanks Adam, Julia, Desi, Brendon, and Luis! Most things I could figure out on my own because BZ is very user friendly, but when something was new it was really great to have the support team immediately available, especially in setting up the Google analytics. The support was very precise and friendly. BZ is fully powered to have great customizable SEO. I highly recommend Bandzoogle not only to musicians, but to business folks as well. Also, after five years when I wanted to completely re-do my music websites, it was easy to set up a new account and keep referring to the old one when needed then switch to the new. Thanks Bandzoogle! --Warmly, Kathleen", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:55:04.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I quickly figured out how much I didn't know when I didn't pass the exam. I realised not only did I need to study for the exam, I also needed to better educate myself on law, requirements, and safe operation. Boaterexam.com was a great time investment to accomplish just that.\nI worked my way through each chapter along with the accompanying practice quiz and chapter quiz. Great presentation of material that was easy to understand and retain. Some was review and much was details I had never taken the time to learn. I passed the final exam on the first attempt.

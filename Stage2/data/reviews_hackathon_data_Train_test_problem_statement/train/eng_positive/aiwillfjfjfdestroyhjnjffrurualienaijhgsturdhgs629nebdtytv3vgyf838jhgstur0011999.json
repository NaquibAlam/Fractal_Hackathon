Well packed. I feel that for what i got vs what I paid, just a great deal I couldn't pass up. The carrying case is a riot, what with Volcano Vaporizer boldly emblazoned on the side. I shall carry it boldly. Would probably have preferred some more bags instead of the case though. Shoot, forgot all about the free grinder that was included. Really am very happy in my dealing with Planetofthevapes!\nAs for the Volcano itself: you got to git one! I got the easy valve classic and it works great.\nWill be a repeat customer.

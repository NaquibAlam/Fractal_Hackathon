Please don't expect fast shipping, which is nearly always free, as the stuff is being sent from China. I've had a couple of faulty items in the past and customer services have been very responsive trying to troubleshoot the problem and have replaced the items without issue. The app is very good, nearly all functionality is covered from within the app, I rarely have to go to the website to do anything. I will continue to shop with Banggood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:01:10.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

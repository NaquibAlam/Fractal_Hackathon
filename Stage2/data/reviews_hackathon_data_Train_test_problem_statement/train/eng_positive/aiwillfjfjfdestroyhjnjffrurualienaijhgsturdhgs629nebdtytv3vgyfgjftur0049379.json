However, the Australian tracking system is a joke and letting down Coolframes efforts to provide a well informed speedy service. Here is a sample of my experience with Australia Post tracking:\nMessage to Coolframes\nHi Eli, well it is now fact, the USPS knows more about the internal movement of small parcels in Australia than Australia Post. My eyeglasses arrived today on Wednesday 01.02.17 AEST, I decided to check the tracking with United States Postal Service (USPS), and as was the case, it stated parcel delivered. Out of further curiosity, I checked Australia Post at the same time. According to Australia Post the parcel had not been delivered, even though I had them on my face. So as you can see, the Americans know more about where our parcel items are located domestically than Australia Post.\nAnyway I have my glasses now, and I am seeing a whole lot better. I hope my feedback on Australia Post assists further enquirers and gives some insight into Australia Post's Hillbilly tracking service.\nSo if you do not mind waiting for your eyewear, and having little info about where they are in Australia, I recommend buying from Coolframes. Their service is prompt and the price is fantastic. I saved at least $300 on the Australian price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:07:36.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

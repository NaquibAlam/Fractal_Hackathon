They explained everything to me where i could clearly understand and answered all the questions i had to ask. They are always there to answer your calls whenever you have questions. Even if you don't make a lot of money they put you on a really good payment plan to which you can afford. This is the first time in a long time that i stop getting calls from all the debts that I owed on. Using URL I feel like im back on track. I highly recommend them to anyone, family, and friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:05:44.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

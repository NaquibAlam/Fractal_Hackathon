Packing is good - everything is safe, solid, and cold. Recipes are easy to follow and while I don't need them the pictures are nice. Quality and freshness of the individual items is really good. Portion size is more than adequate - often have small leftovers for lunch the next day (an advantage of working at home). My calls to customer service have been outstanding. I think I am ready to step up a bit in terms of variety and complexity of the meals. Have had a couple similar ones lately - panko/mozz chicken and then the next week it was panko/mozz fish. Both were good though.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:27:12.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

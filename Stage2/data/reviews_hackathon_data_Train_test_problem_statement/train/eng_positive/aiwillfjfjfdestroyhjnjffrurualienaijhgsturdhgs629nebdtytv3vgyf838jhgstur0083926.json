I remodeled the kitchen about 6 years ago and bought the same line of cabinets (Brindleton Maple) from Cabinet Giant. I was surprised at the high quality of the cabinets. All cabinet grade plywood sides, back, shelves and bottom, soft close drawers and quality hinges. The only thing that could make them better is a post in the middle of a double door cabinet.\nA friend had bought his from a Kitchen cabinet store the following year for his remodel, which took 2 months to get and they were 2 weeks late. Tried to convince him to buy from Cabinet Giant. When I saw the quality I was shocked to find that all the sides back and shelves were particle board. He paid almost $10k for that junk with the nice cabinet faces.\nDo yourself a favor and save a few grand on your next remodel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T12:42:38.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

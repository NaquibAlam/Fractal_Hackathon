After waiting on hold for sometimes 30-45 minutes, you get an overseas call center and they do not have a clue how to help you.\nWith CarRental8, not only do they have a stateside call center, they answered the phone in less than 5 minutes AND you get a courteous customer service rep who is knowledgeable and can actually help!!! What a novel concept! Their rates are competitive and they represent on site car rental companies so you pay the same amount, but don't have to travel off campus on a shuttle to pick up your car. Awesome!!! Will be using them from now on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:40:46.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

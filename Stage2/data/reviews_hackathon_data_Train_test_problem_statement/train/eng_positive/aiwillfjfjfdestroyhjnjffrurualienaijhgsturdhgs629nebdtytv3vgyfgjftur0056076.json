Starting with Miguel, he was excellent on explaining what he was doing and all about the shower doors. He explained that after he measured that the top marble shelf was not level and explain what I should do to level it. The technicians that came to install the shower doors was so professional. They put the mats down and put foot scrubs on their feet so they would not mess up anything in my house. Even when I put the glass against my wall they put something in between it so it wouldn't scratch anything. When they were done and even surprise me they took all the garbage with them. I am so happy with my experience with your company that I have no problem recommending you to anybody that I know that need shower doors", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:38:30.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

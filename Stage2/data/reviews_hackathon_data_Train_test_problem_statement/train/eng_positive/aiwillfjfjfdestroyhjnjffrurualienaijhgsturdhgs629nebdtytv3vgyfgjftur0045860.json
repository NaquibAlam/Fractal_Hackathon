A couple of suggestions:\n1. Between the website and emails and customer service, there were a variety of discounts available, but it was not clear they were mutually exclusive, which leads customers like me to feel there is a bit of bait and switch going on that can erode trust.\n2. Turned out the frames I ordered were on back order. Your CS reps should have data on inventory. I might have chosen another color.\n3. Frame fitting and pupil location, especially for multifocal lenses, may need some adjustment. Costco was able to give me correct measurements when the photo with a CD method failed.\n4. Your CS reps seem great and I really appreciated the expedited lens install and shipment once the frames were available, and the care I am now getting to have the lenses remade correctly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:56:14.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

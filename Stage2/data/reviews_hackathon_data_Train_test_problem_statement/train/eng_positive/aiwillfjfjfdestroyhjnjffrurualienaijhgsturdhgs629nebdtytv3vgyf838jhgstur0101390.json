My first order was lobster tails for one of my sons and his family for Christmas. He was so pleased and said they were the best he had ever had. The next order was the special, lobster bisque, crab cakes, lobster tails and a blueberry pie.\nIt was a gift to my friends who are very special people. It was suburb. The last order was instead of flowers for a funeral I sent lobster bisque and lobster stew. This was appreciated and delicious to serve.\nI would recommend this company to everyone. They are the best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T04:28:40.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

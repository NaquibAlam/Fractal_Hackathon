Shipping times are minimal and this is important if you are at an APO or FPO address. I recently ordered an item from another well-known company on 28 Nov 2016 and to date, 5 Feb 2017 have not received this item and it was a SSD drive. For those of us who order from overseas, this is very important. Beware of those companies who only ship UPS you may not receive it by Christmas. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T13:41:56.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I couldn't fit all I wanted into the sideboard, but that is my bad as I didn't really consider the measurements when I purchased, however, it works for other items I have and is just a beautifully made piece. That being said, the purchase of the item had me a little leery as it was not in my opinion a traditional online purchase, as in I didn't received a breakdown of the purchase or much information regarding shipment only a statement that said it would be delivered by 12/24 (I purchased around 11/24). I believe I received one email when it was close to delivery saying my item had shipped. I had to contact the company through email because there was no number; however, they did answer within one day and gave me a number of the delivery company. Unfortunately, the piece was not delivered by Christmas; it came four days later and the delivery men hit our mailbox trying to get up the driveway (we have a V-shaped drive so it is difficult to get in, but still - they didn't seem to be very skilled drivers). But the piece got delivered in great shape and I really do love it and in the end I'm glad I bought it", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:04:46.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The wheels literally just flew apart and they cracked and bearings came out all the time, it was a waiting game to see what wheel was going next. Buying these wheels from Service Caster are literally a live saver, they are quiet when they roll on our laminate floor, and no more cracking when they are ready to go. They are beautiful, we are very thankful to get something we feel comfortable having people sit in. Thank you so very much!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T11:29:09.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

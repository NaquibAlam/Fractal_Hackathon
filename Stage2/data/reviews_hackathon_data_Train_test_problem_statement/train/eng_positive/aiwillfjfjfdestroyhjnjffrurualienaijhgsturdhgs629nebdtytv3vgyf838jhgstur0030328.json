Free shipping, and unbelievably fast delivery given the heavy weight of my order (Rancilio Silvia and Rocky Grinder). I assumed it would take over a week, but the package arrived in Chicago in a few days. Great online instructional videos to get the most out of the products. Very happy with my purchase, and with the service I received beforehand and afterwards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:14:59.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

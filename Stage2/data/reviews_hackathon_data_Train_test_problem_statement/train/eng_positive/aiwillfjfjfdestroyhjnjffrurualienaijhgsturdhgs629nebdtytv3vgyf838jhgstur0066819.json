I came in and told her exactly what i was looking for and the payments i needed. I picked out three cars that i was interested in and she was honest about what i needed to get them. With my less than perfect credit it was a hard fit but she worked on it for 3 days and got an amazing deal for the first choice. Even more impressive was she offered to come and get me as i had no vehicle and lived in the next county about 45 minutes away. Talk about great customer service. IF you are looking for great quality vehicle, great price and great people to work with you Wesley Chapel Toyota is the place to be and Amanda Baron is the best of the best. Will definitely be back to do business there again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T20:26:12.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

In NZ there is a tax for using diesel of around 6 cents per 100 km and the company picked up this cost. The vehicle was new and in excellent condition. Booking through Rentalcars was easy and they were always on hand to answer any questions. The value for my money was amazing and I would definitely use this company again for my next booking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:04:25.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

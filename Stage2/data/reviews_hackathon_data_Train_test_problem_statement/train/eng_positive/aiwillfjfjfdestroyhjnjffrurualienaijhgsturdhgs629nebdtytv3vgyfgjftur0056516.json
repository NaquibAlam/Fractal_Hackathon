The only bad mark I would give would be for trying to upgrade my passport service. I called in the morning and asked about it, the person taking the call said they would connect me with a manager and then I was put on hold. After about 20 minutes, I was disconnected. This happened 3 times, 3 different people - elevator music for 3 minutes then 17 minutes of static - then \"click\" dial tone. I called one more time (about 3 hours later) and was finally connected to a manager. I received my passports without any other issues. Thank you Merciline Ofelin and team!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T21:24:22.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

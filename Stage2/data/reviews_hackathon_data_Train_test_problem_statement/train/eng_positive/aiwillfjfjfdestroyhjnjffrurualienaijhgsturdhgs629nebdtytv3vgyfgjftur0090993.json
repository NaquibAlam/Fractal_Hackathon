My now wife loves them all! The blue sapphires match my eyes she always says. The quality and attention to detail that went into both pieces of jewelry were exquisite. I designed both from the website and they came out exactly like I wanted. The most surprising and pleasant part about purchasing jewelry from here was the constant attention and help I received from Caitlyn Perlman. We sent over 50 emails back and forth while I was trying to decide on the right ring. She was always quick to respond and gave great advice and information. My wife loves her ring thanks so much Caitlyn!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:20:06.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

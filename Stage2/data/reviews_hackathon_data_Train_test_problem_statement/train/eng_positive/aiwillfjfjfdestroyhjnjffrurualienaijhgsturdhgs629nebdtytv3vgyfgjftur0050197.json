It's a great place to pick up items such as bags and clothes. For those who are worried about clothing sizes, user reviews are usually a great guide. I am fortunate that the 'one size fits all' options fit me, but for those who are not the average body shape and size, shopping may be difficult. Bags that I have purchased through Yesstyle have been complimented many times by friends and coworkers. The only thing is that processing and shipping can be slow when standard shipping is chosen, but they all arrive in the timeframe specified, and tracking numbers are provided, which is great. Some items may be accompanied by a chemical smell, but tossing it into the washing machine or airing it outside fixes that quickly. Anyway, I've recommended Yesstyle to many of my friends, just because the clothes are all so pretty, and they sell beauty products that cannot be easily found here in Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:23:00.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

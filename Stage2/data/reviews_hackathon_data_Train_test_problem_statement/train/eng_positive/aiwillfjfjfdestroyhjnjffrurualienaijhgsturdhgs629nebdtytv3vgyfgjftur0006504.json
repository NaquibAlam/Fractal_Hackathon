However once my issue got into the right hands , Jennifer handled my concerns with prompt, professional, humbled customer care. The mistake was spotted right away and Jennifer went straight to work on getting me my glasses as quickly as possible. After a small bit of phone tag we finally got to speak and had a wonderful conversation full of laughs. Given the circumstances that particular phone call could've been very sour, but she absolutely did exactly what was right. my attitude changed from I will never buy from this company again too it's very likely that I'll make a purchase this weekend and that's all thanks to Jennifer her understanding and very sweet natured customer service. If ever I have another question or need some help with frames direct in anyway shape or form Jennifer will be the person I go to. üòÅ‚ò∫Ô∏è", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:26:32.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Before I discovered Munchery, that would mean I'd grab some fast food and feel terrible after shoveling it in. With Munchery, I'm able to plan my meals for the week so I can just go home, relax and enjoy dinner. The menu is always changing and everything I've had so far has been really good. The delivery service is great and works well for my busy life. Also, if I do feel like cooking - Munchery has some great cooking kit options as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:29:14.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

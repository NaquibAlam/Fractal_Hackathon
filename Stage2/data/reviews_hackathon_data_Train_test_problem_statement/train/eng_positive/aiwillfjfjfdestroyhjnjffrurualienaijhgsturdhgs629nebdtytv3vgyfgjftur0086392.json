It is a great comfort to know that when (not if) help is needed, family is alerted by phone and we can respond immediately ... not at the next visit. The service has been needed for falls several times, and it was a great relief to be alerted right away to problems. Although service to the equipment is not needed often, just this weekend we were alerted by the company to a low battery situation on the body alert mechanism. Although the battery still had more than a month left on the charge, Chris came first thing and addressed the low battery by replacing it promptly. I can't describe the feeling of comfort that results from knowing this reliable service is monitoring the home front for us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:48:43.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I am extremely happy with the whole thing! I installed it myself, and it runs like a charm. The camera quality is superb and I like having the option of recording at motion. The hard drive is huge. What I really liked is the system was sold as a package and all the hard work was done. I wired and installed this myself, and the setup just couldn't be easier. One cord for power and video is fantastic. Each part is carefully configured by SCW and all you do is decide where to put it- drill a few holes and connect. If I can do it, anyone can.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T13:41:17.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This is why I chose Intrepid for a two week group tour of Nepal and India. I knew we were in good hands right from our induction evening in Kathmandu. Our tour leader, Anil, knew his stuff easing our way throughout. I often Quote: him in times of stress (eg no hot water in showers): \"treat it as part of the experience\". Amen Anil.\nHaving obtained my Indian visa before booking the Intrepid tour and entering India in Mombai with a single entry visa, I found to my horror that I needed a multiple entry visa to re-enter in Lumbini. This necessitated an unscheduled return to Kathmandu to await a further e-visa. Unfortunately I missed 5 days of the tour in India including Varanasi.\nMy advice to anyone travelling to India - ensure you have the correct visa and ALWAYS carry ready proof of your scheduled domestic and international flights. Security at Indian airports is stifling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:33:31.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

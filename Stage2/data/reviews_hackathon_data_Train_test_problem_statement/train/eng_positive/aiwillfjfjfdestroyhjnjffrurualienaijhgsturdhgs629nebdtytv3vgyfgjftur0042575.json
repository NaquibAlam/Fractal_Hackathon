I bought a green card from them for $40. It turned out that just replacing the green card was not enough. So I sent them the drive so they could try to repair it. When I mentioned that I had bought a card from them to try the repairs myself, they suggested I return the card with the disk and they would refund my money on that. Unfortunately they were not able to repair the drive either (which would have cost only $60), but they were able to recover almost all of the data for $648. While that was quite a lot more than $60, it was in line with price estimates I had received elsewhere and the data was worth it. They were very accommodating with the \"list\" of files we supplied (it can be hard to remember the full path names of all your files). They kept in contact with me at every step. I highly recommend their services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:56:47.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

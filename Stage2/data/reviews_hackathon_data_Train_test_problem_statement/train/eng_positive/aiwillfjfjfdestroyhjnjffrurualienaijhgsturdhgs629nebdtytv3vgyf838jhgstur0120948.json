I always reserve my room at least 6 months in advance to get the best deal but last September I could not find an affordable price for 7 nights, single room, including breakfast. I must have spent at least two weeks trawling the internet and being presented with ludicrous offfers( how can 670 Euros be considered a bargain? I emailed Amoma.com Ireland and explained my predicament. After a few days they contacted me with a fantastic price and I was happy to book the trip. I always go to Madrid off-season as I operate on a tight budget. Muchas gracias e enhorabuena a Hospital Ganivet y Amoma. Viva las gangas(bargains truly rock).

The majority of the time I am fortunate enough to meet great passengers who range from those just trying to get to work past the rush hour commute, to those who want to chat it up all the way from Wrigleyville to O'hare! Most customers are friendly and patient, as they recognize we neither control the traffic nor the weather conditions that can sometimes cause delays. I try to reward them with a relaxing and safe ride, while using my knowledge of Chicagoland to get them there as quickly as possible. I appreciate the company's pay structure, as they don't take too much of a commission, and the ability for riders to leave tips allows me to usually come out on top.\nAs someone who is also sometimes a passenger, most drivers have been courteous and eager to please even on their first day on the job. I have had the occasional driver who is not engaging or is too married to the GPS, but other than that, I have had great experiences. Additionally, on the few occasions when I have had issues or complaints, Lyft has gotten back to me promptly and been more than willing to compensate me for any issues I experienced.\nWhile there have been a few hiccups here and there, from a rude customer, to the occasional dry spell (lack of requests), Lyft has also done a great job of increasing ridership over the years. From marketing, to giving customers a better overall experience, Lyft has done a good job of working to keep both sides of the fence happy. By keeping drivers consistently informed of local events, peak times to drive, etc., it allows us to be strategic about when we drive to make sure we get the best use out of our time and gas money.\nOverall, driving for LYFT has been a great opportunity that allows me to put my experience and people skills to use, while being a much needed source of additional income. Much appreciated!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:12:11.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

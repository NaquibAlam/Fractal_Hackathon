After a month went by I had to contact them and was told my furniture was being held up at customs. I should get it by the end of the 5th week. I was contacted midway through the 5th week and told they would show up between 8AM - 10AM. They showed up on Saturday morning just before 7AM. Fortunately I was awake so it wasn't an issue, but it could of been an issue for others at that time. The delivery guys were nice as they delivered the furniture to me and I brought it inside and set it up. I like the furniture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:15:55.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

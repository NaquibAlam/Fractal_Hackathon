I have been using them for my kids since they were in kinder garden (they are now in Grades 7 and 8) and some of the items, like tauperwear, I labeled then, are still in good shape. On top of it, the designs are cute and the kids love them.\nTheir website is also great. You get a very good picture of what you're ordering since it allows you to see your actual text, in the various font options, in the various designs/colours.

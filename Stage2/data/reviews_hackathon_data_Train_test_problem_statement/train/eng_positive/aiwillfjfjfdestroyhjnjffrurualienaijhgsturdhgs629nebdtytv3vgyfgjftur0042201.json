Once I got some money I wanted to spend, I went on. Man, was I impressed! They have the biggest selection I've ever seen, rivaling Barnes and Noble, and SO CHEAP! Most books they have are under $5. I can get seven hardcover books for the price of a new one! Even though they're all used, many don't have a single bent page. I have received books that were less than perfect, but nothing a bit of Scotch tape couldn't fix! Shipping is a bit slow, but it's free, so I won't complain ðŸ˜‰ This site is awesome!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:49:56.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

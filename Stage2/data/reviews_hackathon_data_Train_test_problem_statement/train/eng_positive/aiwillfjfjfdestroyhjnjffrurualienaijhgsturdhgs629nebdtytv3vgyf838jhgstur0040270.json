They are cute and versatile and most everything I have ordered has been a good buy. Downsides: 1 - they sell out of the best stuff and the most popular sizes extremely quickly and there is no way to filter on the site to have it show you only stuff that is still in stock. It ends up being frustrating to try and look and have everything you like already sold out. If you could add a feature to filter that would be very helpful. 2 - If you forget to skip a month they will bill you the flat fee and hold the money on your account. So eccentially it's just your money they have taken but haven't given you anything in return yet. When you try to use the credit, they will not allow you to use it on any promotional items. Since it is actually your money, not rewards or coupons or anything, I believe that should be changed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T05:56:35.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

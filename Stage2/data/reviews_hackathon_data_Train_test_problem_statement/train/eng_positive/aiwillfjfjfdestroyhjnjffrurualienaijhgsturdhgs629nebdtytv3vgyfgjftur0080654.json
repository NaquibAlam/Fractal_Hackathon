Maybe having an analog timer clock displayed would prompt the student to take action.\n2) Several questions did not seem to necessarily relate to defensive driving skills. For example, asking the student how much was spent on car repair across the US in a given year as a result of collisions, while an interesting statistic to read in the text, doesn’t provide a worthwhile defensive driving skill that should be included on the test.\n3) I had trouble getting the videos to load (running Win10/Edge browser). Had to back up a page, then go forward a page and try again, which generally worked.\n4) A few sub-chapter segment ’timer’ settings were not appropriate set. For example, a page may only have a video being shown after which there would be another 30 seconds before the timer expired, thus preventing the user from moving on to the next page and consequently just sit there waiting.\n5) Finally, If a student gives an incorrect answer, it would be nice for a review of what the correct answer would be, least that person would never know and could possibly make inappropriate driving decisions in the future.\nNever the less, I strongly recommend this on-line course.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:22:14.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

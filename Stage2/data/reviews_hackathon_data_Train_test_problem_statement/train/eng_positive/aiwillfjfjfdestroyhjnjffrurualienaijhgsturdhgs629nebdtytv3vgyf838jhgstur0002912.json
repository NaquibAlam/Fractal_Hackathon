I hate ordering things online because you never know how they'll actually feel or fit, but I have like every single thing I've ordered from Fabletics. Their customer service department is fantastic, and the quality of their products is amazing. I have leggings that I wear religiously that I bought 3 years ago when I signed up that are still in great condition. I can't really say enough good things about it, so just take my word for it and try them out!

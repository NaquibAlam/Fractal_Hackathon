I am a care giver for a stroke victim. He is completely paralyzed on the whole right side of his body. He must wear compression stockings everyday. Putting on the Magnide on his feet first, then sliding the compression stocking on is now a very smooth process compared to the very hard task of pulling them up his paralyzed foot and leg with out the Magnide. I could not be more pleased because it is less stressful on my patient. Thank you for the Magnide!!!

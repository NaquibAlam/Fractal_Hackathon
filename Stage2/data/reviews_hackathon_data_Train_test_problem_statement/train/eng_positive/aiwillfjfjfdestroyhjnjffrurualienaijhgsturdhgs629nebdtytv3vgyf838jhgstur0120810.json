The same men who ran the Ruxton location when I was a customer there have been running the Charles Village one, and they are hands down the most helpful people I've had the pleasure to interact with in any customer service capacity. They always go above and beyond in making sure I'm satisfied with my experience and suggesting the best options for me. They also work hard to make things more convenient for me, i.e., bringing my checkout papers to me when I've been upstairs switching spaces, since they know I'm in a rush moving furniture, etc. I really appreciate the time and assistance that they offer, and wouldn't even consider going somewhere else as long as they're running this location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:22:33.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

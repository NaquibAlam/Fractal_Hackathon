It took just 5 minutes to get to Centauro's depot and in few minutes (to sign some paperwork) we had a car.\nFriendly and efficient service, would definitely use this service again!\nWould recommend to spend some £££ more for Smart insurance directly via Centauro webpage, not a third party to avoid any misunderstandings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T14:06:48.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

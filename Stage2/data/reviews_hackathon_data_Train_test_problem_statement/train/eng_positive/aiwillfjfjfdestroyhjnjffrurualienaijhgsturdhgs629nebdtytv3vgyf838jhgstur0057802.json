Staff friendly and supportive -as needed to help deal with the nerves and ensure all questions answered. The surgical care and expertise amazing. Can't believe it was so painless and quick. Having been short-sighted since a teenager , the speed at which my distance vision has clarified is just fantastic. Waiting to see how close vision settles but have been told to expect need for glasses with close work. To me a good trade off for my outdoor activities and driving free of glasses/contact lenses.\nBit of a 'blip' with price initally, but his sorted out ok. Thanks to all sfaff at Inverness & Glasgow; and for the sugical expertise of Mr David Teenan and nurses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:25:36.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

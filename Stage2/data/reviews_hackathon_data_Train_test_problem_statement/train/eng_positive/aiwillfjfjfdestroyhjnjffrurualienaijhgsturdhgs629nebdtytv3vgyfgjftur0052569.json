It is amazing! Such great quality, and looks really nice. I cannot wait for all the guys to wear them.\nAlso, the customer service for this company is outstanding. The mailman lost my first package, so I called to ask ties.com what I should do and they told me it was not a problem, and sent me a replacement tie no questions asked! They were awesome to work with. I would definitely recommend them not only for the quality of the tie, but for their customer service too.

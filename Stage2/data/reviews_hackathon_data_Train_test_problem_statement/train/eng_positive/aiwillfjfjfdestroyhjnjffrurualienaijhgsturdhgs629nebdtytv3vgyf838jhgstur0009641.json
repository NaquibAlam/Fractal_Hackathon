Thank you so much for the e-mails that allowed me to compare to other websites and the overall giving me honestly the best offer.\nI will be subscribing now to my next trip, to California, really looking forward to it!\nThank you so much FlightHub !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T17:52:18.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Having recently completed 2 years volunteer service with the US Peace Corps we are not yet ready to settle back into life in the US - Trusted Housesitters enables us to apply for assignments where and when we please.\nWe came across it by chance as we were looking for an inexpensive way to spend more time in the U.K. this year - now we are hooked\nThe website is easy to use, we love the twice daily email digest of new sits, and the diary function enables us to keep our sits organized.\nThe variety of locations, homes and animals is awesome and there is enough privacy built into the process that you do not know exact locations until you have accepted the sit.\nHighly recommend TrustedHousesitters as a way to enable this lifestyle option.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:49:08.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Sometimes there were delays while waiting for your package to rotate through to its turn again. Some of the financial statements were requested multiple times by different groups (previous submissions couldn't be located). The most frustrating came at the end. Although it was stated that all out of pocket costs would be reflected back into the loan as pre-paid items, the last 2 to be requested (water analysis and septic inspection) were not represented back as items paid by the borrower. When I inquired about it I was told that since the VA didn't request them then they weren't considered requirements. From my perspective Quicken asked for them to be done, so I feel they were \"required\" and the $750 should have been reimbursed through pre-paid items. The felt like large costs and scheduling hassles that was just money out of pocket for no benefit. If they aren't required, don't ask me for them. If you do ask me for them, recognize and treat them as required.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:20:12.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

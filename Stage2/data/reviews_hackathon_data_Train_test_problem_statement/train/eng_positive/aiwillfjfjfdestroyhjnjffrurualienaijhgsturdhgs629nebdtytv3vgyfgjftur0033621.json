I needed to find an affordable, easy solution to make our tradeshow booth look great. I found Displayit by googling and I am so happy I found them. They not only have a lot of great options, their website is super simple. I was able to download the templates to design the backdrop but we also were given an option to use their design services. We went with a quick pop up display. They are so easy to put together and take down. I was amazed at how easy it was. I've had experience with another brand of the pop-up displays and taking it down was very difficult and required some strength. This is so simple. You click together a few pieces and press a button to unclick them instead of having to forcefully unhook them. The order process and shipping was also extremely fast and simple. The graphics look great as well. We also purchased the case-to-counters which are an amazing concept that we can ship and pack everything into something that is actually useful to us. We will be saving some money not having to rent tables or finding a case to put the display in. Absolutely love this company and will be looking to them for all of our tradeshow needs in the future. I would recommend them 10/10!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T22:18:17.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

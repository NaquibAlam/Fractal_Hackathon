The worse being the \"Google Chrome has stopped working\" messages. Even after switching to Firefox, issues persisted. Tried all the \"fixes\" online with limited success. When the Driver Support window popped up, I decided to give it a try. Is the price, $9.99 per month worth it?? The main trouble I experienced after activation was the driver installation of RealTek (something like that). There were two or three of those installations and I lost internet connection each time. This was a big hassle. Completed updating drivers last night and so far, so good! The computer is definitely faster and one program that had been problematic is running perfectly. That makes me very happy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:56:42.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

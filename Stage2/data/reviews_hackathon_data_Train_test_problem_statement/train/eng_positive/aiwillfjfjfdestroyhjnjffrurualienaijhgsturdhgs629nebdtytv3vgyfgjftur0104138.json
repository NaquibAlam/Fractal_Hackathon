The driver was very friendly and refreshments were provided. The transfer to the resort was very easy and went smoothly. The return trip took a lot longer due to checkpoints at the German border. We just about made our flight thanks to some back roads that the driver knew. I think the company should allow more time for return trips like ours where queues at the border on a Sunday are normal. Other than that the interactions before and during our stay were very professional and I'd certainly use the service again.\nP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:47:09.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

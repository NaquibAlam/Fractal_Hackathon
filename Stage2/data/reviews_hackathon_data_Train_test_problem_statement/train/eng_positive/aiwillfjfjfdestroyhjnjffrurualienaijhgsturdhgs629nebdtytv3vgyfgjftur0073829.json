They have a variety of different coins series and \"packages\" of 5, 10, coins to meet your investment needs. However, I find their pricing to be average. There are other dealers offering similar coins at similar prices. All in all, I would've liked a better deal at smaller investment amounts.\nWith all that said, I need to mention that the service received by the associate was excellent. He was not pushy, trying to sell something to me, rather he was kind enough to explain to me the special offers available, that I might want to consider. The purchase I made that day was clearly my own and not influence by the dealer.\nHonesty is very important in investing at any level, with both the investor and the investment provider. I certainly recommend Monaco Rare coins as one of your sources of investment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T19:52:50.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

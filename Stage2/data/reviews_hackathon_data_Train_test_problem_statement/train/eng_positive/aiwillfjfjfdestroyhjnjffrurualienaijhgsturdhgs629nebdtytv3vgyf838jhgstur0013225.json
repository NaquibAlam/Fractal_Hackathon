The watch was terrific. I wore it most days and never had an issues. After owning for about 9 months and without cause or warning, the watch ceased to function. When I contacted Banggood customer service initially, I was told it was out of warranty and they would not repair or replace the item. This was not satisfactory to me given how much money the watch cost, how recently it was purchased and that I had done nothing to cause the watch's failure. After a little back and forth with customer service and contacting the manufacturer, Banggood contacted me and decided to repair the watch if I paid to ship it back to them. Although it did take a few months between shipping to Banggood, repairing and shipping back to me, I did eventually receive back the watch in good working order. I've had it now for 2 weeks and it appears to be working very well and I'm extremely happy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T10:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T10:34:31.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have waited eight years (four years past the court completion terms) to get my driving privileges reinstated for financial as well as long-term abstinence from alcohol, which was what lead to my license being taken (as understandable). I chose not to drive a day in this period. Amparo was kind and helpful in assisting me through this process in order for me to regain privileges that I can drive responsibly. Thank you for making this a positive experience! Driving again will help my employment reach as well as allow attainable other life goals personally and in community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T11:46:11.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was at the Las Vegas course Nov.14-17 2016 at the World Market Center. Our instructor was Joe Drammissi and he was very thorough, detailed, organized and informative. He was able to break down the PMBOK information into real world examples, all while letting you know what info you need to key on for the exam. After the course, the online material and resources provided by the PMA portal were very helpful to continue to study and their practice questions were the easiest way to identify the knowledge areas were I needed to improve. I passed the test on the first try and couldn't have done it without Joe and PMA!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:55:01.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

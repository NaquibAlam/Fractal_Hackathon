Like, I went into this thinking maybe that it wasn't legit, that if I waste my money I learn my lesson, boy was I wrong. The salvia I got was great, never done it before today, but I read for days online what I could look forward to. I wasn't let down! My trip had me on a boat in the middle of a tropical island with the prettiest blue waters. But the odd part is, is that the island was in a vast cavern. A cave-like space with rock jutting all around the waters and up above. It was such an amazing journey. I was talking to a group of flamingos!! Lol loved it and most definitly will purchase from them again:)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:01:56.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

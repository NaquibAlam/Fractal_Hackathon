Make sure to check the balance right away and ask for a refund if there are any problems. I've never had trouble getting a refund, but it is a hassle all the same. I wish that GCG would account for the available coupons when listing the discounts. I know other sites do this for other things (like bigwords.com for books/textbooks) so I don't see why GCG can't do the same thing. I use GCG all the time and at nearly every store I go to. After deciding what I'm going to purchase, I buy an electronic card before getting in line and have it ready to present by the time I get to the cashier. It's such a money saver!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:31:59.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

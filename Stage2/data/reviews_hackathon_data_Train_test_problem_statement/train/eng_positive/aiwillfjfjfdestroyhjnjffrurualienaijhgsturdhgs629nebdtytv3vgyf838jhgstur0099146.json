Her birthday was on the 21st.. didnt know how to send her a gift so i searched the internet and found bake me a wish!! So i ordered it in. I was very hesitant at first because the price is a bit high what if it is a scam.. but i read a lot of good reviews here so i continued my order. When the tracking number was sent. I constantly check it every hour. When it finally arrived the next day, the delivery guy just left it infront of my mom's door.. luckily my mom saw it just half an hour later and she was surprised! The packaging was great. The cake is still in good condition.. i will definitely order again and again and again!

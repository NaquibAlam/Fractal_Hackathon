I had to leave my car in Sheffield on Saturday/Sunday evening as I got a puncture with no spare and no breakdown cover. I booked my fitting on Sunday afternoon with a 2 hour time slot the next day. I was able to meet the fitting driver at my car and he fitted my new tyres within minutes. The driver was very friendly and arrived 15 minutes earlier than my allocated slot which was great and I received a phone call to let me know. I received a technical data sheet 30 mins after the fitting detailing everything that had been changed including a receipt via email.\nJust an amazing deal / price and great customer service excellent!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:06:23.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Their service has been wonderful. Whether I put an order on 1 day's notice or 1 month's notice, they manage to deliver the product in time. The products themselves meet my expectations and the recipient[s] love them. Granted, the products delivered may not look the same as the product advertised on the website. However, that's to be expected when the order is processed and sourced in another country by a local florist contracted by the company. Nonetheless, I still love it and will continue to do business with the company in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T14:12:29.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

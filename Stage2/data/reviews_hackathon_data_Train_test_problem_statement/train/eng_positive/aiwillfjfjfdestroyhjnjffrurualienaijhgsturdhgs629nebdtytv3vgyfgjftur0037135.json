It isn't WholeLatteLove's fault, but the newer model is not at all as well made as my older one. I am glad I had my older one, because the grounds don't knock out of the filter basket on the newer one. So, I put the old filter basket in the holder and solved that problem. I don't like the new frother, which gives me inconsistent results compared to my first Gaggia. Also, the drip tray is poorly seated and rocks back and forth. I would definitely research another espresso machine before I bought another Gaggia Classic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:01:04.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

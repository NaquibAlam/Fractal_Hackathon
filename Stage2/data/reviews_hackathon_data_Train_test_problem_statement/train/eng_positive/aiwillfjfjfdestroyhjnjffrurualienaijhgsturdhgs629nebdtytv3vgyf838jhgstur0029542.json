Their price was great. To order it from eBay or Amazon would have cost anywhere from £25-40 at the time of writing this review.\nWith standard, none tracked airmail, it only cost around £17 in total - and arrived within 5 days to the UK from dispatch.\nI have a very minor gripe...which is postage.\nThe standard postage is pretty cheap - but you risk having to wait 8-12 weeks delivery in a worst case scenario. The airmail postage is reasonable and pretty quick (5-12 days). But when you want say, quick delivery which is insured and tracked etc the postage can seem quite high. I can understand why - I mean, they are coming from Japan..but if for example a Cd costs 2500 yen and postage is 2250 yen (for the best postage option) then it can seem high. (less so on bigger orders I imagine)\nLike I said, it's not a complaint. I've ordered a few things over the years, and never had any issues...even using the lowest tier of postage. I think as I grow older I've just become impatient when waiting for things! Ha ha\nI would say the best option for most people is airmail, tracked or non tracked are both of reasonable cost.\nAnyway, I will be ordering some more albums next week as even with postage, they're the cheapest price that I can find for the items I want online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:21:35.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

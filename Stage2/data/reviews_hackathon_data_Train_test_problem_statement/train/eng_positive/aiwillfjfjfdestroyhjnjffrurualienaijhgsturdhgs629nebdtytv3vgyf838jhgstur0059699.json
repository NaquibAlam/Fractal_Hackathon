Every time I e-mailed customer service I received a response within 24 hours as they are in a different country/time zone.\nI love this company and will continue to order all of my sunglasses from them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T05:17:29.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Not abnormally long, but too long for a normal large long sleeved shirt. Especially in flannel. I saw my neighbor standing outside and he had on a new flannel shirt and I asked him where he got it from. He is tall with very long arms too. He said Kohl's is the store his wife gets all of his clothes from. Well, two taps later on the computer and there it is. An entire world of Big and Tall clothes from\nlong sleeved T-shirts to long legged flannel P.J.s. Kohl's carries many brands of big and tall so there is a huge selection. The website even has a sizing strategy so I was able to select the proper sizes. Long story short, everything I ordered fit as expected and was of good quality and workmanship. Everything has been washed many, many times and all are long armed or long legged as ordered. You can't beat free shipping either. I highly recommend this store online to everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:34:54.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Since I wanted a seating configuration that wasn't listed on the website, I called directly. I spoke with Andrew who handled my questions knowledgeably and in a friendly manner. I placed my order with Andrew for 6 Seatcraft recliners in a specific configuration after being assured that they were in stock.\nThe seats all shipped promptly, and I was given tracking information that allowed me to follow the shipment. They arrived on schedule and without damage. However, after unpacking I discovered that one seat had a cracked cup holder. I Don't fault 4seating.com for that as this was a factory defect that couldn't be seen without complete unboxing.\nI called Andrew about the broken part, and he transferred me to John Jasso in customer support. John picked up immediately, and listened carefully to my explanation of the problem. He offered to have a replacement part sent and to be installed at no charge by a technician, however I elected to perform the simple installation myself. John promptly followed up my call with an email confirmation and tracking information. The new cup holder arrived quickly, and I replaced the broken one easily as it was the correct part and a perfect fit.\nThis completed my set of theater seating, which is very lovely and comfortable, by the way! Overall I'm completely satisfied with my purchase and with the service I received from 4seating.com. I wouldn't hesitate to do business again with them in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:07:27.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

(I had actually purchased another brand online first and wasn't happy with it, but it was returnable so I hoped buying the Saatva wouldn't be another disappointment. The biggest issue is that my partner had a back injury years ago and needs a very firm mattress. She was really hesitant when I suggested the Saatva but after reading the reviews and talking to the company reps, I felt good about my choice.\nTurns out it was the right one. My partner LOVES this mattress, and so do I. We've only had it a few days, but it was comfortable right from the start. I was concerned that it might end up being too firm for me, but I love this mattress, too.\nSaatva's customer service was excellent. Delivery and setup was a breeze. The mattress quality is outstanding. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:29:06.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

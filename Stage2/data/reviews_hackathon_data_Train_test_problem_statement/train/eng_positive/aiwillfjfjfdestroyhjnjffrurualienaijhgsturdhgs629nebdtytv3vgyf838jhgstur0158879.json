The process was very easy.\nThings I enjoyed about this experience: the website is relatively easy to use, checkout was fast, the glasses came with all the trimmings. The return process was easy and I had a refund in my account before a week.\nThings that would deter me in the future: extremely long processing times - it took 3 weeks before the glasses were ready and shipped to me. Not much choice on lense coatings - i find the anti-glare not up to snuff, and I would have liked an option for better protection. I had to pay for shipping to have glasses returned and then processing fees were applied (of which I was not made aware) to my refund.\nOverall I've had worse online shopping experiences and I've had better. I don't know if I would purchase again given the issues stated above. The prices are genuinely lower than other sites, so that would probably remain a decisive factor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:29:01.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

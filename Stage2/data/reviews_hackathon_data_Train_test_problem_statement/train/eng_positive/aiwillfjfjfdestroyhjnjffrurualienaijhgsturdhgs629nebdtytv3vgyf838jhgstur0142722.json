Found Factory Pure through Google Generator search. The explanation of how the generators were cleaned and checked over and the option to by a warranty was fantastic. When purchasing, a chat opened up and it. The customer service rep was pleasant and not pushy. I did ask if we can have it shipped to the Fed EX dock...and we sure could. Overall a great experience. Have already told many people about the site. And we will be buying from them again. - Michele, Texas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T10:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:40:11.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They were just as delicious as yours but with FREE SHIPPING. Even if I paid shipping costs, it was still way cheaper. My $25.00 coupons for your lobster rolls merely covered half of the shipping cost and I still was paying more. So I suggest you check out this competition before making those claims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T19:19:04.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

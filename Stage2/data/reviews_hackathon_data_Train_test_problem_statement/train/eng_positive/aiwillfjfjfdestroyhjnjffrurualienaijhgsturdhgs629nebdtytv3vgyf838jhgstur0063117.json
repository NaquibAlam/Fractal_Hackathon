I am writing this by my free will and not getting payed for it.\nThis service is absolutely outstanding. I admit I was really dubious about use anything else than my bank so I called them and they were really good at the phone, I check the review and they seemed good, then i try to compare the transfer between my bank against Transerwiseand at the same time I was checking the excange rate on google at the minute... it seem to be too good to be true.. I have then tried and guess what??? It is actually all true. The excange rate applied is exactly the one on google at that time, the fee is exactly what they say and there are no hidden fee the service is so fast that in one business day the money were where they were supposed to be... and on my transaction I have saved a stupid amount of money compare to what my bank was offering to me.... thanks thanks thanks please keep up the good work finally someone that work honestly", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:22:05.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Sakura had her week holiday last week and bonded really well with her hoist Shelia they got on really well to well in fact as Shelia wanted to keep her lol. When Sakura returned she was happy and seemed to get right back into her routine so all in all I was happy that all went well, and will have no worries next time Sakura goes on Holiday, as its peace of mind to know Sakura has gone from her own home to another dog loving home for cuddles!!!\nThanks guys see you soon Stewart and Victoria.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T20:30:29.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

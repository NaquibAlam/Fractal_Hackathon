The lenses arrived when scheduled, which was about a 10 days after I placed the order. They lived up to my expectations. I definitely saved money over purchasing directly from the optician. The one strange part of the transaction was that I didn't get a confirmation email from LensDirect immediately after I placed the order. That didn't come until the lenses shipped, several days later. All I got was something from Google indicating that I had made a purchase from a Google Trusted Store, but it didn't contain my order details. I also didn't like the \"handling fee\" of about $1.50 that was added in at the very end of the transaction, which isn't going to be reimbursed by my vision insurance. Had that $1.50 simply been baked into the price of the lenses, it would have been reimbursed, and it also would reflect a more accurate cost for the lenses when checking the price online. Despite these two minor complaints, I am satisfied with the web site, the purchasing process, the price and the shipping time. I would consider LensDirect again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:36:14.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

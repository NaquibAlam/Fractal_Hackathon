And it's great to have a site to search for the best deals online, or at least get an idea of what a decent deal on a specific gift card is. However, it still needs improvements. For starters, they need the \"sell\" search option to be more prominent and easier to find. It IS a site that compares gift card resell sites that buy and sell. Secondly, I miss the option to narrow your search by value, seller, etc. They used to have that option along the side of the of the search results but not anymore. Most buyer don't need $100+ value gift cards. Another thing, if they are going to do a rewards program, it should be actually be rewarding. The point value is nominal and not worth my time. It's better off they don't offer a rewards program if they are going to be cheap; it makes they look bad. Last but not least, they need to improve their mobile site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:13:17.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

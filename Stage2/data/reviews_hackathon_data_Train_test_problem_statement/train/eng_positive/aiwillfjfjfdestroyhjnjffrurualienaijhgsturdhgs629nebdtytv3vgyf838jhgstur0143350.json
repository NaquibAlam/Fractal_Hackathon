Product is great, Customer service is generally outstanding.\nMy only complaint is when running the 16 camera system it will only hold approximately 2-3 days worth of footage (We purchased our system with two 8TB hard drives). Not really very good if I need to review footage from a week ago! My old DVR would hold footage for around 14 days but obviously the image quality was far less.\nThe recommended solution from customer service was to decrease quality, which seems pointless as the reason for the system was the image quality or to install a NAS on our network. Great solution but extremely expensive!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:31:51.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This particular cabinet fit perfectly. The particular style/color fit in well with my existing cabinets. When I tried to adjust the doors to line up with each other I was still off enough that I decided to have the doors open the same direction versus away from each other. Not what I had planned but it works fine. The price was good and shipping was quick. As far as overall quality I am quite happy with this application but I will note that the finished sides at the bottom tended to splinter a bit so I would hesitate to buy this particular style for my future remodel. I do like the fact there is no particle board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T12:42:39.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

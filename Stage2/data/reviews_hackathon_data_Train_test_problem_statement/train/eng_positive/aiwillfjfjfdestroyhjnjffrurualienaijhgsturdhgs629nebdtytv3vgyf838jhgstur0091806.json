Exchanging the voucher for the pass was easy and straight forward. Most of the time we chose to reserve seats. Using Hyperdia and google maps to work out options for trains. Manned with a list of train options assisted the station staff. ( only necessary if you are reserving seats). Will definitely use the trains on my next visit.

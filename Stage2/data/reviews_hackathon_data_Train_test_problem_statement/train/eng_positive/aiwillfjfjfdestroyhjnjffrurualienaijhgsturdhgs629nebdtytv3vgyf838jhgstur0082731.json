I have found the prices to be more than fair, the workmanship excellent, and the people just wonderful to work with. I've had zero surprises after placing several orders... after really miserable (and expensive) experiences with local frame shops.\nI wish the frame sizing and order preview tools were more sophisticated -- please put some energy into this! Apart from that, I have nothing to complain about and everything to say thanks about... the frames are also very well packed for shipping.\nIt's a relief to find /something/ that works right these days.

I didn't have 4-6 weeks to order a new one through the mail. Rushmypassport was recommended to me and I am very pleased with the quick, professional, courteous service. Yes, it costs a little more to do it this way, but the knowledge I have my passport in hand takes away a lot of stress, and the price is worth it for me! I definitely recommend Rushmypassport if you need a passport! Bill Hess was a huge help answering my questions and giving me direction with patience. He sent me an email, keeping me updated on where my passport was in the process each step of the way. Thanks Bill! And thank you, Rushmypassport!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T17:29:37.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

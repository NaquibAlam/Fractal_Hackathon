I find the design part of the site to be very user friendly, and my cards looked just like my design--there were no surprises (and I've had lots of surprised in the past... after 500 cards were printed). Moo allows you to purchase in very small quantities and they keep you informed every step of the process. The cards are printed and shipped very quickly. Overall a really great service!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T10:21:16.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

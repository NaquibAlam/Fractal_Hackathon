I decided to take a chance on them because they were offering a great special at the time (New Year's Eve) and I liked their logo gallery. I was pleasantly surprised at how awesome my logo and business card designs turned out and Monica Telpis, my project manager, was very helpful since I can be very picky. She was patient with me until I got my design exactly how I envisioned it. Thank you so much. I will be using their services again and I will refer others them for sure!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:44:55.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

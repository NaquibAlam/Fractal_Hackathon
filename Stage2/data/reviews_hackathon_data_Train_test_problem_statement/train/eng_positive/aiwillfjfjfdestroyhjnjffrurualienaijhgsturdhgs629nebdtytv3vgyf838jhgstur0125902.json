They were very easy to work with and very responsive to questions.\nTheir price points were much better than the other manufacturers we looked at and used before. For example we used Oasis in the past. Their price for 1000 cd's is currently $1079. The price for 500 cd's is only $100 less. We got 500 cd's from WTS for $515 including shipping. That is a big savings and significant to us as independent musicians.\nThey don't do digital distribution or any marketing but that is pretty easy to do yourself nowadays.\nThey even gave us some technical assistance with our artwork at no charge.\nWe are very happy with the quality of the finished CD and would use them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T08:00:17.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

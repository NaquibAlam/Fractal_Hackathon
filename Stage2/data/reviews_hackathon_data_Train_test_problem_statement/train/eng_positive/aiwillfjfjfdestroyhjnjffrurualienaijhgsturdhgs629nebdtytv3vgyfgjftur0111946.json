Casters look to be good quality. Basically things were good but one of the 4 casters had a couple of fairly substantial dings. It evidently been dropped on a hard surface, maybe concrete, and because of this had created a somewhat sharp edge. These are casters with the metal \"shield\". It wasn't noticeable enough to be worth sending it back so it got put on the chair and left as is. Ordered it for replacing chair casters for my folks. If needed I will take a file to it to smooth the edge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:05:03.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

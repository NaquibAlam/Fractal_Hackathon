The first time i bought glasses i was unsure of the quality and my having cylindrical power make me a bigger skeptic. Lenskart came out with flying colours, and i got very affordable and sturdy glasses, which gave me perfect vision till the glasses worn away - literally. The second time i have bought a pair of glasses, one for main use and one backup. I would say go ahead with the choices, and if anything doesn't feel right, they are always there to return, repair, fix and refund if needed. :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T13:57:20.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

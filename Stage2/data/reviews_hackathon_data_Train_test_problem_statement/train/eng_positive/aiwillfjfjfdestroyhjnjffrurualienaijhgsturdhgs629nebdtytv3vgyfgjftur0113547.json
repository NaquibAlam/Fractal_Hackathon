Talked to a person and was able to order just what we wanted. Product included $8.00 postage and handliing. Came in 2 days. However, It met our specs, but we were using them on carpet with a heavy chair and it just did not roll because the carpeet had padding and it would not roll. As an 87 year old man, I had to work out another way.\nI returned them today via UPS. Any refund woujd be appreciated >", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:04:53.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

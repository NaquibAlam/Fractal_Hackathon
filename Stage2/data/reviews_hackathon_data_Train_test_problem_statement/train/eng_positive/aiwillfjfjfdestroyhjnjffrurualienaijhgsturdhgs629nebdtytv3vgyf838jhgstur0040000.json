I have only used them for about a week, but I have only good things to say. I imagine that the thick goretex material will make for a very durable life to these snow pants. The size medium fit me (5'11\" 165 lbs) very well. I love the amount and placement of the pockets on the pants. Just with the bib pocket was big enough to fit a smartphone. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T23:43:00.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

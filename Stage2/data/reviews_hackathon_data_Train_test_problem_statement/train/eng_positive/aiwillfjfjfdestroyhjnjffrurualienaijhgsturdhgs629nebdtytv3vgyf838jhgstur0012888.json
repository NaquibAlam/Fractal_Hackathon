When they finally caught up with me and started sending me letters I couldn't blame anybody but myself. The IRS filed 3 tax liens against me which of course went on my credit report. I talked to a friend who had been in the same situation and he suggested that I call Optima Tax Relief because he had gotten excellent results when he used them. I called Optima and they made a commitment to me that they would do their best to get me the best results possible. From day one Optima handled my IRS case professionally and kept me informed and up-to-date on the progress being made with my IRS case. They filed my taxes and provided the IRS with all of the information and submitted all of the paperwork to the IRS on my behalf. Now here is where I was left speechless. The IRS said that I owed OVER $60,000 dollars in back taxes, interest, and penalties! Optima Tax Relief files my offer in compromise with the IRS which was $50 and the IRS ACCEPTS IT!!! When I got the letter in the mail from the IRS I did not expect it to say that they had accepted the offer in compromise and that I only owed $50. If you are reading my review about my experience with Optima Tax Relief because you are in trouble with the IRS and you are considering using Optima Tax Relief to represent you in order to resolve your tax problems with IRS I want to say to you GO FOR IT! I can't thank them enough for what they did for me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:00:35.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

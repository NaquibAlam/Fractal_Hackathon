When I remodelled my kitchen my friends asked if I was going to put words back up as I had before because they loved them. I did intend to, and ordered my phrase. After I applied it I realized I needed to add more to fill the space so I placed another order using the same font, color and size. When I received it I saw they weren't the same height and called the company. Christina took my call and was wonderful. She explained to me why the heights were different and I totally understood but they also wanted to make sure I was happy. She asked me which size I liked best and then had the other phrase remade to match it - at no charge...and the longer phrase was the one being remade. I am so happy...I love my walls!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T06:39:18.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

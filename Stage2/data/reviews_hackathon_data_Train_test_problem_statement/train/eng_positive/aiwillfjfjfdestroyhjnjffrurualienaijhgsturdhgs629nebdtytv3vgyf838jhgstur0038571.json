Freeze Pro one of the few stockists of the G3 glue renew strips. The G3 website led us to believe that there was a choice of sizes, only one size on the site, so have some spare glue srip for patch repairs in future. Price was good, certainly massively cheaper than a new pair of skins. Went for free delivery and they arrived the day before expected so very pleased.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:43:58.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

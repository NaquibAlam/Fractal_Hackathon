I have dealt with a lot of auto transport companies, most of them tell you anything to get you to commit & then the excuses start. This is my 2nd time with your company & both times worked out great. I told Jackie my time frame & he told me at 1st that was going to be difficult due to the holidays but he was able to come up with a truck that would meet my schedule unless some bad weather hit. It was a California to New York trip. The next day he called after I had already committed and said he had come up with another truck that carried (2) cars & could beat my schedule for $200.00 more. I said great! The trucker was great to work with. I will not call anyone other than Jackie in the future", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T09:52:51.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

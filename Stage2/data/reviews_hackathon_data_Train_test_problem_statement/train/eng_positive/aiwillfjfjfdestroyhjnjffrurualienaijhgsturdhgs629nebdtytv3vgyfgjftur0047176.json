I have moved from Cambridge, but if I need something which Didriks sells I make a point of shopping there when I visit Cambridge. My most recent visit was January 2017 when I stopped by to look at and purchase Pillivyut porcelain coffee and espresso cups. Over the years I've purchased a complete set (service for 16) of Pillivyut dinnerware mixing and matching elements from various series. In addition I use Pillivyut bakeware. The selection is well chosen but not for everyone. I would never buy some of the items because they are too expensive or don't suit my needs. The service has always been excellent. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T13:57:52.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

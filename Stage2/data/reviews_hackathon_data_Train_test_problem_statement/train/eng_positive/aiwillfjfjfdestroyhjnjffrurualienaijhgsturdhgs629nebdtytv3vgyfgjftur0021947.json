We were disappointed by the usual round of estate agents but then had the good fortune to view a house with Philippe Calvez of Sextant Properties. What a difference! We quickly signed a contract putting the sale of our house into his hands and didn't regret it for a moment! He proved to be committed, energetic and extremely skilled in his work, both in conducting viewings and negotiating.\nHe was able to find us the ideal property amongst his portfolio and then skillfully managed both the sale and purchase for us, always going the extra mile in whatever aspect of the deal. We signed for both on the same day a few weeks ago and are absolutely thrilled.\nWe do not hesitate to recommend Philippe Calvez for buying or selling in Brittany. It has been without doubt our best estate agent experience either side of the Channel. He offers an exceptional service!

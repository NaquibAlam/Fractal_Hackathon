I've purchased a Pinarello Dogma 65.1 Think 2 frame set, and had it shipped to the US. Customer service was outstanding (I talked to Matt), and I was surprised how quickly the frame arrived by mail. Super well packaged and impeccable product. Due to this excellent experience, I also decided to purchase a winter bike from Road Cycle Exchange. Again, I worked with Matt and ended up with a Wilier Motirolo bike that was advertised as 'well used'. The mechanics, chain, sprockets, and wheels were new, and the frame in outstanding condition (only a few scratches on the 2009 bike) when it arrived. This time, I had the bike delivered to Germany. Again, fast and secure shipping. Easy assembly, and I've been very pleased with the quality of product and the comprehensive service by Road Cycle Exchange. I have recommended this business wholeheartedly to my friends and the local 'chain-gang'. If you're in the market for a used (but good as new and expertly serviced bike), give Road Cycle Exchange a go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:52:22.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

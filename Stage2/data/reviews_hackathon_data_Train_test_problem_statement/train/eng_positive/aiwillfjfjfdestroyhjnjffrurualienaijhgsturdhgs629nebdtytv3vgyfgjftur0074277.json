The tracking info said they would be delivered in time for my honeymoon, but when my package came with all my other winter gear the boots were not there. I immediately went into my email to check & it said they were processing! Ah! (Honeymoon less than a week away) I called customer service & got transferred to JoAnne. She located my order & said that my boots were coming from a store rather than the warehouse & they ran out of the boots. She then took my phone # & said she would check into it for me, 10 minutes later she called me back saying that she canceled my previous order & reordered my boots...not only that but she put a rush order on my boots (FREE of charge!!!) in order to get them in time for my honeymoon! She offically made my day & I couldn't thank her enough for her amazing customer service & taking such GREAT care of me! YOU ROCK JOANNE!!! Thanks again! =)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:15:16.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

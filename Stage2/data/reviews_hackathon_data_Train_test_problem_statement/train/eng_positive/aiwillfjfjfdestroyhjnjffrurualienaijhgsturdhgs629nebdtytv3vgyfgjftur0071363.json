I've used Select Quote: in the past for my Life Ins needs, But have only recently learned that you also are involved with meeting peoples needs for Auto and Home Insurance as well. I called and let one of your agents ( Robert) go to work for me on both our Home and Auto ins and was I ever surprised to see the amount of money he and Select Quote: saved me on both. I've been wanting to do this for sometime and have recently retired and now have the time to sit down and do. By the time he was done running both of our policies through different carriers and settling on a Insurance Co. for me, He had saved us $355.00 a yr on our mortgage Ins. Select Quote: almost cut it in half from what we we're paying. Then on our auto ins Select Quote: saved us $400.00 a yr on that. I couldn't believe that between the two Select Quote: had just saved my wife and I a staggering $755.00 a year. I'm definately going to tell family and friends to call Select Quote: to shop for their home and auto ins needs. I couldn't be happier plus your agent Robert went over the top with his service answering any questions I had and took his time as not to just run me through the system, I really appreciate that. Thanks so much. I can't give Select Quote: enough stars to rate their absolutely OVER THE TOP EXCELLENT SERVICE. A VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER.

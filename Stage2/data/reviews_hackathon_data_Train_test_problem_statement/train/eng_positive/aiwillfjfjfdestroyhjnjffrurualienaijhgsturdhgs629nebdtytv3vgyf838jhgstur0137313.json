As a new mom that works all day it's important for me to spend time with my family at home. But it's also quite challenging coming up with creative, healthy, and inexpensive meal ideas week in and week out. Hello Fresh was the answer for me! Not only that, my meals take me anywhere from 30-45 minutes to make, leaving all the extra time to enjoy my family! I will also note that I am researching and took into account many factors before deciding to go with Hello Fresh. In other reviews some may say that competitors' meals (like Blue Apron) are a bit fancier... so I will say, YES, Hello Fresh meals are quite simple, but it's sort of \"back to the basics\" food - healthy proteins, fresh produce, simply put together but super delicious! Also, with \"fancier\" type meals also takes more ingredients and ... more time! It all really depends on what you are looking for. I am also thankful for less waste happening in my home. The only thing I wish is that I could have a box that I could send back instead of throwing away all the box and all of the freezer contents each time. That would be the only thing I'd like to see improved. Thanks Hello Fresh!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:39:14.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

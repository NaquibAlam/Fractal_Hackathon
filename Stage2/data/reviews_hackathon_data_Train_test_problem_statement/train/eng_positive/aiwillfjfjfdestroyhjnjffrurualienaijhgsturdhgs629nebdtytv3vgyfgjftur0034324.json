Chatty helpful young man patiently waiting for us from the ferry. Very knowledgeable about the area with some excellent information and helpful hints. Thorough intro for the car and safety and included free use of a car seat for our granddaughter. Excellent reception and prompt service taking us to the airport for our return to Wellington. Would not hesitate to recommend the company and the staff. Very friendly staff; great price for rental car. Smaller motor than I am used to but plenty of space for 2 adults and a young child. No issues with travel and very economical as well. Well done team and many thanks from the Wilsons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T13:23:26.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I ordered my dress last Thursday and got it the following Monday! Also love the free shipping! The dress itself was a bit snug and the top was a bit loose. The beading was not as high quality as I anticipated, the dress certainly was not worth $400.00, but it was still higher quality than one finds in regular department stores. However, this was not Promgirl's fault as the sizing issue was on me, and the dress was not misrepresented as being something it wasn't. Overall, I have encouraged my friends to shop there since it has such a wide selection, and cheap prices. I got my dress for only $150.00 instead of the $400.00 retail price!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:26:57.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

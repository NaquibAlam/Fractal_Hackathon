I had placed an online order and wanted to exchange some of the items for a different size. I called kohls.com customer service and the associate who helped me was very courteous, polite and smart. He could place another order for me with price match in the sizes that I wanted without any hassle. When I got an email about the order, I realized that he ordered one of the items in the wrong size. Even though he made a mistake, I am still super happy with kohls because I called again and another person could help me with cancelling that order and placing it again with the correct sizes, again without any hassle. I am not deducting any stars for the mistake that one associate made because we all are humans and we all make mistakes. It is about you handle that mistake and how courteous you are to the customer. Very impressed that Kohls has got it right!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:34:24.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

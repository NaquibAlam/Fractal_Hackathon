We wanted to use Constant Contact as a means to send out our newsletter electronically to our changing membership. From the very beginning, the folks at Constant Contact have been extremely supportive and helpful. We send out only five newsletters annually and maybe four \"special\" announcements so it is difficult for me to remember the sequence of steps to successfully sending out our documents. The support service people have been very helpful and understanding in walking me through the process. What I find interesting is that there are several ways to accomplish the task and each time I contact them for help I learn something new. I cannot give enough praise for the support team at Constant Contact.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T22:33:46.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

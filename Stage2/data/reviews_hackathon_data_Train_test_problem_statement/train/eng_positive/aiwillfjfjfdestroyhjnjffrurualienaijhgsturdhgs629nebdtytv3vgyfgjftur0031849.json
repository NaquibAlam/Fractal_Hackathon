Bus and train weren't going to fit my schedule and so we enquired at the Redspot Car Rentals. We were assisted with the car with free GPS and full tank for fuel. I was asked to just drop the keys at the desk in early next morning since there was likely to be no one in attendance when I arrive for my flight. The service was great and just what I needed at that time. I recommend them to anyone in similar situation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:53:50.291+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Given the make and the age of my car and the fact it has runflat tyres, it should be obvious to the company, 'tyresonthedrive ' that my car does not have standard valves and instead, it has non-standard valves with sensors. The company could have told me at the outset when I booked the car that replacement of valves is not included in the deal because of the reason above.\n'tyresonthedrive' needs to be more transparent to customers", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:57:48.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They make a big difference in the appearance of my 2005 Kawasaki Vulcan 1600 Classic. I first tried just slinging over the rear fender but could not get them to fit to my liking with a Sissy Bar mounted. I then hard mounted them with the enclosed mounts but did not like the amount of space left between the bike and the bags. I then made my own mounts (I am a machinist) to keep from cutting up the factory mounts just in case I did not like the way they fit. They now hug the bike nicely and look very nice. I really like them. Knowing what I know now, I would buy the same bag again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T20:20:11.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

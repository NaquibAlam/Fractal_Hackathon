Biblio offers 10% discounts for Bibliophiles Club members (a huge deal at $25 a year) and a 20% discount on your next order if the seller can't fulfill an order for whatever reason. The Biblio website is also very easy to navigate, with a sophisticated search engine (though I have never been able to figure out the \"Best Match\" algorithm, which routinely returns ridiculously high numbers of books that \"match\" your search criteria). Biblio is also very PayPal friendly, unlike Amazon and ABE, Finally, very responsive customer support in the event of a problem with any order. There is always room for improvement (more listings from a broader range of dealers to match ABE, some way of separating out \"expedited\" from \"regular\" shipping rates for individual books that are part of the same order), but even now I give Biblio an easy A+. I couldn't live without it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T18:35:53.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Car was ready and was as reserved. Outside not clean but the inside was. Booked out as no damage but there were in fact several scuffs and paintwork marks and so we had to ask the Agent to mark the damage on the sheet - which they helpfully did. Return process was nice and easy. Overall, a good experience but just need to have more Agents at the check in desk really.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T15:23:33.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I'm pretty sure even 10 years ago few would have entrusted their home and beloved pets to a complete stranger, but the way a relationship is constructed through this website builds up all the confidence required to hand over the keys, dog leads etc and go away, relax. As a sitter it is equally important to be confident in the communication process and the transparency of information; if you go ahead and make all the travel arrangements required you do not want to be messed about. There is lots and lots of back up and support. To be honest I haven't been so excited about a new opportunity for a long time - our first sit was a great success and we intend to build upon it and our experiences with more applications very soon. Thanks guys for the opportunities - and I'm telling just about everyone I meet!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:38:33.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The photos online do not do the Stephanie justice. The stones are so sparkly that it's really hard to see the stones even when you look closely! I've never seen something sparkle so brightly, so continuously, so brilliantly. In fact, the band sparkles so much that it's hard to make out the details of the 2ct center stone in any detail (though it is a good size for this ring though).\nWhen people see her ring, they want to hold it - probably because it's so hard to actually see past all the sparkle. When you hold it in your hand, you realize that this is a solid thing of substance...the engagement ring with a 2ct stone totals 6 cts. When the wedding band gets in, she'll be sporting 10.5cts on that finger! Never imagined that something like this would be within my means.\nThere are 16 .25ct stones around the band of the engagement ring - each one has its own certificate. Each stone is certified as the best cut and then is examined to ensure that it's up to his company's even higher standards. It can take a little while for the stones to get in and then to have them all put into the Stephanie, but oh my gosh there is no other ring that I have ever seen at any price that is comparably blingy.\nI have been delighted with the service at Brian Gavin, with their pricing and most importantly with their product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:41:09.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

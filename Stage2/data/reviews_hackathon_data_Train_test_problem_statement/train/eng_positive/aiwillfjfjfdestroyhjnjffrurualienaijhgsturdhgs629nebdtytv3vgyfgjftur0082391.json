And the youtube video\nNevertheless, the water tastes wonderful, and we can taste dissolved minerals from softening scale, though that will lessen over the weeks. What's best is there's no chlorine in my bath water or in the toilets. No more chemical or putrid city water smells masked by chlorination.\nWe feel like we are at a hot mineral springs hotel right here at home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:16:03.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

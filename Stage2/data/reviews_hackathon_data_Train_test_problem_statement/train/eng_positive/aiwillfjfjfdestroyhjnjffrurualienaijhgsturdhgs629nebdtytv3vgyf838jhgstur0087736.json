Cheapest by a long shot in comparison to competitors (Â£40), most definitely a bonus as this is nearly 30%.Boots arrived in two days despite paying for next day delivery but this was after the \"next day\" time which was unclear until after payment, so understandable just not clear whether I would have saved money on delivery if I had waited until the following morning. Boots arrived in appropriate box with necessary paperwork. On first inspection the boots are scuffed in places, one quite bad one on the toe of the right boot, possibly from the travel as the boots were not secured in the box. Overall very happy, just slightly disappointed about scuff on toe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T01:59:29.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

All the pieces fitted together like a 1,000 piece jigsaw puzzle, and apart from some serious inadequacies on the part of British Airways, every thing was perfect - thanks in part to the meticulous planning and attention to detail by Goway. Wonderful stays at the Twelve Apostles, Singita Ebony, and the Royal Livingston, and on the Zambezi Queen.

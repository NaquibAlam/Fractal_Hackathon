The support services and server's performance truly has been spectacular, especially when given the poor optimization state of the game and its server aplpication. I've had to contact support on two occasions, both issues were induced by myself. Never the less, they responded within 10 minutes with a prompt resolution to my issues.\nI will continue to use this provider and recommend their services to friends looking to host their own servers.

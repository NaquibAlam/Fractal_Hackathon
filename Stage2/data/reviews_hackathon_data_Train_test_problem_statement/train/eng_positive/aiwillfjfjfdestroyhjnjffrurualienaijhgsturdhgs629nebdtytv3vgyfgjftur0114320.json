They use a water gel to keep the roots moist which is better than wet newspaper IMO. I sorted my order and realized I was short two trees. I called the number in my order form and spoke with a woman who gave a specific person's email and directions of what to send him. He contacted me quickly and filled the rest of my order without hassle. I would definitely buy from and recommend Willis Orchard in the future", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:29:18.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

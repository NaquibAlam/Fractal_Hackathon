We particularly loved receiving the free sample box and used it to make an informed decision regarding our usb type. Our account manager Alex, was always quick to respond to any queries or questions we had, and made up multiple electronic samples for us. Would have liked to have a free sample usb with our branding before printing multiple items as it is always hard to tell what it would look like from a computer screen. All in all, was an easy process and will be using flashbay again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T16:24:25.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

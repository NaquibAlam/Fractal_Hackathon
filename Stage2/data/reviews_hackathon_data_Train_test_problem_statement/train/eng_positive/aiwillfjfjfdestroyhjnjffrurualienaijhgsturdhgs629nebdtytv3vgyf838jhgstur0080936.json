I was a lil skeptic about services like this and leaving my dog in the care of a stranger....yet we do that when they first get groomed, first get shots, first get to find a friend in a dog park so why now? They are our babies and we only want the best and we found that in Daniel. He even gave Nicholas his eye drops for us and let them sleep out of cage or on his bed....a true dog lover!\nJulie", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T13:20:37.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

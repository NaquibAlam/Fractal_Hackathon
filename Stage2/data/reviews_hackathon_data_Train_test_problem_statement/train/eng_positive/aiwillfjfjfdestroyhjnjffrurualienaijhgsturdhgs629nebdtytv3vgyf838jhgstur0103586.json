I was able to add all the flights in the same check out cart so I was hit with the service charge 3 times. It's only $11.99 but it would have been nice to know about it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:24:30.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I never got the cashback, and I opened a support ticket and nothing was resolved. I'm over it now, and never have had any other issues, but for someone more anal than me, the lack of resolving a support issue could be annoying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:09:20.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I wanted 2 seats that were isofix, forward facing, ideally no isofix base as they take up so much room in the car and could grow with the kids. I found some options that were over 400 euro and included fussy isofix bases. I started to think what I wanted didn't exist ,by chance I found uberchild , I spent lots of time reviewing the seats, I was amazed and a bit suspicious after years of wasting money on other seats. This time I knew exactly what I wanted. Everything including the price which is phenomenal seemed genuine. I bought the seats on a Sunday night, 2 days later seats had arrived. They were fitted into the car that night, they are non fussy, no isofix base but solid in the car. I'm delighted with them, kids love them, the recline on them is fairly minor but they are comfortable, well padded, buckle is easy to fit , the seat grows with the kids too, I genuinely woukd highly recommend them", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:24:37.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

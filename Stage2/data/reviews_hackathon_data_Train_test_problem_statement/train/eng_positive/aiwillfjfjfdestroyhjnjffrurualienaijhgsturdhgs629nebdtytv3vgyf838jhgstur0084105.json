I liked them because they fit my long arms and larger hands. I needed new gloves and went to the Web. I ordered Lymphediva gloves due to cost and all the fun prints. For a lot less $$, I got 3 glove & sleeve sets in bei chic and 3 in onyx (6 sets total). I Love Them!! They are lightweight yet do the job the bulkier Jovi did. They are not bulky at all! I wear my onyx to work every day. I have issues with swelling and hot flashes. These gloves & sleeves do both- compress without being hot or bulky. Customer service is awesome! Can't wait to buy some prints next!! Very very pleased.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T10:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T21:34:52.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

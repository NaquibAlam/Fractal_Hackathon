Not only did they have them (no one else did), they had the style I was after (wallet case) in several colours.\nNot having heard of Mobile Mate before, I first researched them on Whirlpool as I'm paranoid about online shopping with companies I don't know. Reviews on Whirlpool were positive so I placed the order.\nThe phone case was dispatched the same day and I received my order IN PERTH only 2 days later.\nThe case is great quality and fits the phone perfectly!\nCouldn't be happier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:34:54.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

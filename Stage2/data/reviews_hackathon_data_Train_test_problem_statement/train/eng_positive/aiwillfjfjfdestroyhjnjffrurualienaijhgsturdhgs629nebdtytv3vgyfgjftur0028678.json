Since my international order required customs clearance I inquired prior to ordering the shipping details. Information given to me turned out to be wrong. My order was sent in 2 parcel and I was not informed about it. Upon inquiry with Wiggle they provided details that enabled me to get in touch with customs to find out wiggles did not supply information on items/invoice with the parcel. As a result I needed to inquire at customs and provide information, shipment was delay by a week and I encountered additional fix charges in the order of 25-30Â£. Wiggle was just sorry, so am I.\nEnd of story I got what I payed for and I payed a bit more. Correct service would have avoided the nuisance.\nWith a couple of days in-between the posts I need to add:\nWiggle customer service came right back to me and suggest a refund for above mentioned charges. After providing evidence to customer service they arranged transfer within hours. Service beyond my expectations, I'm rather positively surprised. Thank you for that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T16:40:15.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It’s very close to, and within walking distance of many of the cities attractions such as the cathedral, Sam Bento railway station, Torre dos Clérigos, ponte Luis 1 and the fashionable eating/drinking area of Ribeira.\nThe hotel is situated on the first floor (second if you think in the American way) and although there is a lift in the building, there is no lift to get you into the hotel, only a flight of stairs. There does however seem to be a chair lift for the mobility impaired.\nThe rooms are comfortable with en suite bathroom, tv and wi-fi in the rooms and to be honest for a 2 star hotel it was both good valued and a pleasant stay. The reception staff were very friendly and took an interest in how my day was etc. You can organise trips through them if you have not alreay pre-arranged anything. There is also a small bar in the hotel in the reception area.\nYou can opt for breakfast which was a simple affair of tea, coffee and watered down orange juice, bread rolls, croissants, ham, cheese, fruit and yogurts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T17:03:55.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Excellent driver; knows roads well; speaks English very well. Outstanding knowledge of sites, related history, culture. Tours of Adadi Mariam church, Melka Kuntare excavations, and Tiya Stelae monoliths were great. However, most memorable parts of the tour were interactions with Nurelegn and other locals. On way to Adadi Mariam we purchased some food. At lunchtime, we were invited to eat in the home of a local family. We shared our food with them and got to know them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:17:48.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The only problem I had was they required a signature for deliver and I work a lot. I finally actually had my new stethoscope in my hands after almost a week with it sitting at my post office. Wish they left me the option of delivery without signature. Also, the free pen I received didn't work. It was a cool pen with a light on one end and a rubber end opposing, which would have been handy because we use touch screens at my job. But, after one day of use the pen would not consistently write and the penlight was dead, and I never got to use that feature! The stethoscope is awesome. I hoped the name engraving would have been on the tubing, not the bell, but it is all good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:28:40.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

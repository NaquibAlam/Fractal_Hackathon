Plenty of authentic reviews, lots of different vendors with quality goods and great prices! There's been maybe a couple of items that didn't work for me so I just gave them away. But at their prices, it doesn't make sense to return; at least not for me. The rewards program helps ALOT with the different levels, perks for reviewing items and $10 coupons. And I didn't even mention the free international shipping with a $35 or more purchase. Do you know how it easy it is to exceed $35 on this site?!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:22:33.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

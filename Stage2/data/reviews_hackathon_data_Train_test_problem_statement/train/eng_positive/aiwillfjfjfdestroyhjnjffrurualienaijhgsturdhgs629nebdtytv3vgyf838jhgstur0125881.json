So I finally decided to look into it, well I realized I was signing up for VIP but I didn't realize it would cost $49.95 a month so at first I was a little frustrated and wanted to cancel. I called fabletics to cancel and the guy on the phone told me I could skip months if I didn't want to pay $49.95 for one month and I was thinking, like alright let me try it out. Well here I am 3 months later, haven't cancelled but I thought about it. These leggings are very nicely made meaning they won't rip easily! I feel comfortable in them being a little overweight because it sucks me together lol. Also that $49.95 actually allows you credit towards your next purchase. VIP gives you much better deals than the original deals. So if you're like me and don't wear jeans anymore, this is a great place to shop for your next favorite part of leggings. You can use these leggings to work out or even go out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T18:35:21.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

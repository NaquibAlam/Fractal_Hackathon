We were reminiscing about long ago when we would fly from Florida to Boston and enjoy a meal of fresh Maine lobster. She can no longer travel so I ordered a pair of your 2 pound lobsters, chose the delivery day and enjoyed a fabulous \"date night\" right at home. They were alive and kicking when they arrived & it was a fabulous meal. Cooking instructions were easy for our cook/server to follow (our daughter). My wife has few things to smile about these days but this did the trick. Thank you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T19:18:50.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The voucher came through quickly & with warnings to read the contract for suitability. The small print in the contract is, happily, reasonably short (compared with others) & in plain language. Like most reviewers, I am still apprehensive about any charges that might be imposed at the actual time of hiring - e.g. the infamous total waiver insurance - I'm intending to take out a standalone policy before I hire but will this be deemed 'acceptable' on the day by staff at Alamo? I can't fault Car Hire Labs, though, in any respect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T01:50:57.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I tried to return it, I was told I could only exchange, which is fine. However, instead of giving me store credit to buy something else at my leisure, I had to purchase something to get the refund for the original purchase. Seems a little backwards. Just give the store credit to the store online and let the customer buy something else when they see something vs. forcing them to buy something to get the refund of the original item.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T22:43:11.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

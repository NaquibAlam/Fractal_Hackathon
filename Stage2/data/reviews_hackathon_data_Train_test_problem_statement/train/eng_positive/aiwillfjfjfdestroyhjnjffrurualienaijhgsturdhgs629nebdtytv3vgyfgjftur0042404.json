As a first-time pet insurance shopper, I chose Figo because of the user-friendly format, straight forward plans to choose from, & easily understood verbiage. The initial purchasing experience was very simple & seemed to offer competitive fees. When the time came to file a claim, that too was extremely easy & efficient. Photos of receipts & invoices for care were easily uploaded along with the claim. Samantha Hall responded to all my email questions very quickly. We received our reimbursement check in a timely matter - about 2 weeks later! Figo Pet Insurance is a pleasure to work with, and I HIGHLY recommend this company!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T14:26:39.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

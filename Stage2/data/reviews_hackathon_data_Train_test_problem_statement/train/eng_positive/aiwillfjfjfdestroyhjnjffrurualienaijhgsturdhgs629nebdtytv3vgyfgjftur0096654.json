For instance, say a certain IT certification is a requirement, and the candidate applies for your position but does not have the cert --- he/she checks no --- it will sort that candidate and not put him at the top of your list. Nice auto screening process.\n-Customer Service is great (Thank you for your help Sarah!)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:28:12.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

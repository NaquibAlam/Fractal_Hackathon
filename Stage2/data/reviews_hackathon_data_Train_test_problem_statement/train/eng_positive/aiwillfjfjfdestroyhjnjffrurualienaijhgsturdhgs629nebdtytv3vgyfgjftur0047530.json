I spend a lot of time studying different shoes. Plenty of opportunities to get great deals. I live >30 miles from a running store and its hard for me to get there when they are open. I hate big box stores; I always end up helping other customers pick shoes when I go. RRS has been my trusted running shoe source for 15+ years. Provided shoes for all the training miles for 7 marathons, countless halfs, 10K's and 5K's. I've evolved from one type of shoe to another over the years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:27:12.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I did my research and called to speak to someone at the Boutique before ordering. Once I ordered, everything went great, from shipping to receiving, I ended up getting the dress in a size too large (but dress was perfect just like the picture), ultimately, I had to call back to return and get the next size down, customer service has been excellent and the newer size dress is on its way. I would highly recommend Peaches Boutique!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T23:36:39.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was relatively accurate but based on reviews, I did order a size larger than I would normally wear. I think this suit will be beneficial in the winter when I wear a coat but for summer use, the suit is too big. Eventually I'll have a summer and a winter suit because I'll be buying my correct size in the future!\nI'd say the biggest issue is in the length (the crotch hangs almost to my knees and I'm not short) but that is easy enough for me to remedy. Maybe it's not cost effective to make suits in varying lengths per girth size.\nAs for the quality of the suit, on it's own merit, I think I'm going to be happy. I will be ordering from this company again - same suit style but my size per the sizing chart.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T10:33:47.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

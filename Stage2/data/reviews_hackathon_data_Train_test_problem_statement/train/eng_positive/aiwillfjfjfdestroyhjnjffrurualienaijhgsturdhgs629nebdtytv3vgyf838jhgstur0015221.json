We both do not speak Spanish and actually stumbled over this website by coincident through search engine Jetcost. Needed an affordable place to stay in Madrid area last minute, which was more difficult than expected due the carnival season. Got a nice lift from Barcelona to Madrid via BlaBlaCar and got dropped off directly in front of our friendly Hispanic host family's place. Though none of us spoke the other person's language, we managed to have an awesome time during our 4 days stay and Google Translate on our smart phones made things easy to communicate. I found Homestay more easy to manage, than signing up with Airbnb, as our host found us over the website and made us a good deal. The fees for the service were more than fair. Thanks Homestay.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T19:07:22.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

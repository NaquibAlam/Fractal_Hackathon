A friend of ours from Maine sent us a gift certificate and I made my fianc√© a 2 lobster dinner with lobster bisque and bread rolls, corn on the cob, salad and cheesy roasted potatoes and a bottle of wine for a special meal as I am deploying to the middle east shortly. Thankyou Maine Lobster Now for an amazing evening and great memories. I fully expect to use your services again and will recommend you to others.\nJosh and Lanita", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T04:27:56.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

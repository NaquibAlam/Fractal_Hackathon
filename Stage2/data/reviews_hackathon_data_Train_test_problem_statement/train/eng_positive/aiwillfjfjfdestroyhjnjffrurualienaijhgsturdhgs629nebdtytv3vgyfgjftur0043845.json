We find we move down the path more easily and effortlessly.\nWell I must say I have found this experience with \"Warrior Trading\".\nMy first day I was taken back by the technology used to run this trading room, the professionalism and focus of full time day traders. The transparency of all aspects of trading including \"Dollar Wins and Losses\" There is no holding back of information and openness to answer the many questions, which is really quite refreshing.\nRoss Cameron who runs the trading room is there to help everyone and anyone with open arms no matter what experience level they are at. Ross is very humble, soft spoken, reserved, aware and a fantastic teacher and trader. There are hundreds of traders attending the room and it all runs so seemlessly it's really quite remarkable.\nI am very impressed with Ross, his team and the community of traders. You have nothing to lose by jumping in with both feet that's for sure.\nI have attended another trading room at more than double the cost and I felt that I was in the dark. The reason why, is because I was left in the dark.\nI have learned so much over the last four days I would say my learning curve has gone parabolic!! ( stock trading term) Lol.\nI am having a blast learning all there is to know about trading and Warrior Trading with Ross Cameron will undoubtedly get you to the next level!!\nWishing everyone the best year ever for 2017 and beyond!!\nThank you Ross, your team and community for building an inspiring trading room and school.\nTom\nUxbridge, Ontario\nCanada", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T23:51:18.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

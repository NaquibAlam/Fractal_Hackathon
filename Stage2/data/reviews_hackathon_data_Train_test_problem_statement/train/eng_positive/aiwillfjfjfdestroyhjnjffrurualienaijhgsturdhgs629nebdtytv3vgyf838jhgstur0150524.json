They made the ENTIRE experience of buying a car easier than ever! Felix D. made sure I was happy with everything, answered all questions professionally and with a sincere smile on his face. They ARE NOT car salesman they are ROCK STARS! I strongly recommend Drive Time to everyone looking to get into a vehicle. You will walk in a customer but walk out feeling like family. P.S. My son really loves the popcorn machine . I'd give more than 5 stars if I could.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:44:09.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

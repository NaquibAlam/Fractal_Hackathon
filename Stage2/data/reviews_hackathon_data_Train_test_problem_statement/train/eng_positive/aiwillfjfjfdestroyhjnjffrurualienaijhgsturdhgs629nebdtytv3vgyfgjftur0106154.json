Customer service were fast to respond and available via phone and email (same person you spoke with previously always available), and very helpful and friendly. We packed the box ourselves and I was nervous returning that because we did a pretty rough job that things would be damaged from transport etc and everything was in perfect condition, not even dusty. From the office to the delivery people we found the whole system hard to fault - highly recommend!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T22:01:22.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We suspected it might need a new Flexplate & had gotten a price from another shop of $700.00. We called Cottman & Roland said, it might not be that, it could be a much less expensive repair, come on in & we'll evaluate it for free. My husband dropped it off & said if its under $200.00 do the repair, a few hours later Roland called to say it was lose bolts in several places w/the trans & torque converted and he had it all fixed & ready to go. We didn't have to wait for another day, after the initial evaluation, he didn't try to up-sell us on things we didn't need. He even told us that the transmission was in good condition & had been worked on before and that the motor & trans in this old Jeep would run for another 200K miles. This gave us some peace of mind about our teenage son driving it.\nHe was honest, trustworthy, a man of his word, polite and courteous. We couldn't have asked for a better experience here!\nAbsolutely recommend Cottman of Trenton on Olden Avenue in Ewing for your car's needs!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:27:58.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

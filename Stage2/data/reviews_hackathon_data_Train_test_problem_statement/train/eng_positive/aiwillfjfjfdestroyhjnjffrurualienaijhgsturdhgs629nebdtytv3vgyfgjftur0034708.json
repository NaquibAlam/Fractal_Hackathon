The selection, the prices, the cost and speed of delivery and the deals are outstanding. I have been nearly a weekly shopper since I found this site a few months ago and overall I have been VERY pleased. I have just one grievance and some might call me overly picky. However, when I order a book and it says like new or very good condition, with no indication that it is an ex-library version, and it arrives with discontinued library stickers all over it, that really irks me. Thirftbooks clearly has an option to mark books as \"ex-library\" and very often does. I appreciate this information because I prefer a clean copy for my shelves at home. But of the 40-50 books I have ordered so far about 10% have been mismarked and I get an ex-library copy with no warning. Overall it may seem a small issue, especially when weighed against all the great books I have received but its an easy QA fix that would make Thiftbooks a 5 star on line retailer in my mind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:22:25.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It's very simple and the price matching program is very nice also(no regrets, or having to wait to buy tickets).\nThis week I booked a flight(with a transfer). The next day a very nice gentleman name Pankaj Gupta called me to let me know that my transfer was going to be a little to close for comfort. So he suggested to change my connection giving me a little more time to make the next flight, and he did the whole thing without me having to lift a finger.\nGood job FlightNetwork for your great service and for hiring Pankaj Guptaüëç!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T19:38:13.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

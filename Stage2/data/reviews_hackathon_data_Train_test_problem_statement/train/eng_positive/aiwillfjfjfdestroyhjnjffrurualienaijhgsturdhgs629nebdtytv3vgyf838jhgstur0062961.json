Amoma agents were friendly and professional through the whole booking process- I had to change my dates twice after booking and they did not charge my a rebooking fee, and were understanding and helpful. The website has the cheapest prices I've seen for the same hotels advertised by other companies, the prices are incredibly competitive. This is the first time I've used them but I've been recommending Amoma to everyone since! 5* for price and service! Thank you Amoma :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T17:41:53.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

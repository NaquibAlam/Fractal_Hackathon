Was very happy that I could get the flight at a great rate on Flight Hub without any problems. There was even an offer for one month free special deals membership, which gives you special rates for rental cars and park-n-fly. Glad I found and booked on this site!\nHighly recommend", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T10:59:49.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

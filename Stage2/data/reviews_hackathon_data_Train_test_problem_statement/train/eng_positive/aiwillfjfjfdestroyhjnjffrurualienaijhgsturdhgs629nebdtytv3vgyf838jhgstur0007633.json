However, their description of a product could be better. The dress that my daughter chose to order for prom is W YYY thinner than pictured. Looking at their photo the dress has no flaws. The dress that my daughter received, you can see straight through it. Even with white or nude panties you can still see her little butt clearly. The lining in her breast area is much thicker and keeps you from being able to see through. I don't understand why they didn't make the entire dress this way with the price being $289.00.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:28:08.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

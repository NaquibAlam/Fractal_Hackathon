At first I was dealing with my bank's recommendation which wasn't local and a couple other dealers I've done business in the past. None of them could deliver what they promised nor could they do it quick enough so I decided to try Truecar. A couple of the same dealers came up on their list but when I tried the one dealer I had never considered I was told they could deliver what I was requesting. I showed up the next day and drove home in my new van with no issues. They delivered and came under everyone else's asking price including the MSRP my bank recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:00:32.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

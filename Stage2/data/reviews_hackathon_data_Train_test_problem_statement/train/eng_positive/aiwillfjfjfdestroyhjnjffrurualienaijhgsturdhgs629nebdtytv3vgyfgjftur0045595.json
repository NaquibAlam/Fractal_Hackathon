Usually no big deal if you have local teenagers to pop in and feed the puss. But Smokey pines when left alone. He pulls out his hair and is totally miserable. Catterys are fine but he loves company. Also as we love to travel, leaving the house empty for regular periods is not ideal. TrustedHousesitters ticks both boxes. The sitters we have had have been fantastic with Smokey. He is happy and relaxed when we get home. The house is also spotless and well cared for. We also get to meet interesting people from all around the world. We love TrustedHousesitters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:16:59.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

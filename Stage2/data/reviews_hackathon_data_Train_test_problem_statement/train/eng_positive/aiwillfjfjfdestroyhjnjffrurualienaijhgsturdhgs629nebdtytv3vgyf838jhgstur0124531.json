Intrepid offered a very interesting and thorough itinerary. Our guide Aziz was always friendly and helpful as were the local guides. Our driver was very professional and friendly and his lack of English was not a problem.\nAziz made a few wise changes to the order of the itinerary to help us cope with the hot weather. Most of our group became ill during the trip due to an infection of some kind (Not Moroccan) and our guide was always aware and helpful and helped when required.\nThere were so many \"Wow\" moments. But my lasting memories are the times we met and interacted with the locals. Enjoying a night under the stars with tagines, drumming and dancing, followed by sunset while riding our camels out of the Sahara, an impromptu invitation to share mint tea in a Berber home, and enjoying a meal, drumming, singing and dancing with the beautiful family that we were staying with in Atlas Mountains. Wonderful memories that will last a lifetime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T12:04:49.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

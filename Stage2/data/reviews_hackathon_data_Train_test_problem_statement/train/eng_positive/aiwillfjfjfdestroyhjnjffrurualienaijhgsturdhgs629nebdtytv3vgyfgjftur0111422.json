Excellent Customer service and faster than expected shipping and arrival of my bare root plants, when I received them they were packed extremely well and had an ample amount of hydration gel to keep the roots good and moist during shipping. I had one issue with one of my trees, as it had a questionable scar in the bark I was concerned about. I contacted them about the concern and Willis Orchards did not hesitate to send me another tree to replace it. Overall I am very pleased with the company and will not hesitate to Order from them in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:26:00.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Although the fed. requirement is \"clearly visible from 50 feet\", NJ has their own stipulation for the lettering of the numbers / letters to be 3\" in height. I unfortunately learned this AFTER I placed my order.\nSo I called DIY lettering, and spoke with Joyannette. What a wonderful experience. She helped me re order the order, and graciously offered me a discount for being a \"big dummy ordering for the first time\", and getting it wrong. She was extremely understanding, compassionate to my plight and even helped me with the processing of the new order.\nWho could ask for anything more ? A company who cares ??? and works fast to get your project up and running ?\nHighly recommended...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:36:55.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

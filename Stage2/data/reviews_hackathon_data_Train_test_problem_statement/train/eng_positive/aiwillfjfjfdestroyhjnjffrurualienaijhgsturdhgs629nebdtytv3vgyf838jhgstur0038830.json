I want to locate their store from a list of meta names in an online search, verify that the item is the same as what I'm looking for with no \"refurbished\" remarks anywhere, clear price and cost of shipping (if any). After that, I want to easily check out by paying with a card or Paypal and receive a verification by e-mail of my purchase and showing that no extra hidden charges were added. Soon afterward, a shipping notice and an expectation of approximately when the company thinks it will get to my door. What I DON'T want is a sneaky ad by e-mail advertising their other products when I know I never signed-up for that. And I certainly don't expect to get ads from other companies as a result of my purchase, although that is getting harder and harder to verify. From BeachCamera I got: Confirmation of purchase with order number clearly shown with their customer service e-mail address to contact them if I want, a simple and concise list of how they process their orders and what they are doing with my order (the fine print few read but very informative), next came the shipping notice with a tracking number internal hyperlink and another set of informative descriptions concerning signatures for packages and such, and an invitation to fill out a survey about their service \"so that we can learn from your experience.\" and lastly, an offer to review the item purchased online. BeachCamera.com did a very complete, yet pleasant and to the point job of all this. And that is EXACTLY what I want from an online company.

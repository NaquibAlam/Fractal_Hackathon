I'm a scientist who is starting my own business and have everything to learn about how to do the \"business\" side of this endeavor. My call was answered quickly and then immediately forwarded to Dee Kahler, who walked me through the process of incorporating, offered me a series of options and answered ALL of my questions without any condescension. She patiently clarified what was needed from me and then proceeded to complete the transaction quickly and conveniently for me.\nRemarkably, when she provided the paperwork for me to fill out to obtain a tax ID for my new business, she explained that it could be complicated and offered that I could call her for assistance completing the documents. The next day, I called the 800 number and Dee answered directly and greeted me by name! No being shunted to someone who did not know what I needed!!! She quickly and graciously helped me with my paperwork and reminded me to fill in a portion that I nearly forgot. She replied after I sent her the forms with my new tax ID and additional information that I needed - and had not known. I feel like I had a personal business advisor walk me through the process and make sure that I did not miss anything. What an outstanding service! It was a pleasure working with Dee and I would gladly come back to Blumberg for additional services, as needed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T22:10:25.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This makes it hard to travel as much as I'd like, because pet sitting gets expensive and I don't trust just anyone with my babies.\nA fellow travel writer told me about Trusted Housesitters when I needed to go to Colorado for a week. I live in a small town in an older home and didn't think anyone would respond. To my surprise and delight, I had two inquiries the morning after I posted my ad!\nI ended up going with a really nice firefighter from Toronto who wanted to escape the cold and come down South. He was the BEST pet sitter I have ever had. He emailed me photos and updates daily, took out my trash, kept my home tidy, and even dropped me off and picked me up from the airport, which was an hour away.\nI cannot say enough wonderful things about this service. I'm going to apply for house sits myself, too and can't wait to meet more nice and interesting pet-loving people via the site.\nThank you Trusted Housesitters!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:42:06.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Thanks!\nOverall, it's a nice trip. We were satisfied with Eclipse travel! Thanks!\nAt every airport, they picked us up on time. Thanks!\nMost of the tour was performed well as plan described, we like the tour at Peru Lima, Cusco, Machu Picchu; Brazil Rio, Iguazu (Argentina & Brazil), Chile Vi√±a del Mar & Valparaiso, Santiago. Thanks! But there were some disappoints, e.g. some tour visit places were closed or some tour were not performed as planned -- e.g., 12/26 half day tour at Santiago Chile, 12/20 one day tour at El Calafate Glacier National Park, 12/24 half day tour at Punta Arenas, 12/18 one day tour at Buenos Aries.\nMost local tour guys were good, patient and helpful. Thanks! Except the one for 12/18 one day tour at Buenos Aries, she (Mariana) had no patient when asking her questions about Recoleta & Palermo part and showed her mad, it made the tour time unhappy.\nMost tour pick up was on time. Thanks!\nMost meals included were good. Thanks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T14:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:20:43.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

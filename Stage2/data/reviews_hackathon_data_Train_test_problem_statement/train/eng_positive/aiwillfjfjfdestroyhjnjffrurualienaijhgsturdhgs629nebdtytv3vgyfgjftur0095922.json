But then I tried it. I signed up and posted approximate dates and all of a sudden I could pick and choose a FREE (yes FREE) petsitter. WOW, I hadn't been on vacation with my partner because one of us has to stay with our dogs. We have paid friends before, and they left the house messy... Well, we are pretty particular too, but we found our perfect match on trustedhousesitters.com: VEGANS. Yes we didn't want people to cook meat in our home. We were so happy. The site was easy to navigate, the people were reliable and wonderful, so wonderful we consider them our friends now. The house was CLEANER than when we left it and our two dogs had the time of their lives, going on day trips. We received photos every day. I am so glad, I feel so blessed that there's a place like trustedhousesitters.com!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:45:10.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

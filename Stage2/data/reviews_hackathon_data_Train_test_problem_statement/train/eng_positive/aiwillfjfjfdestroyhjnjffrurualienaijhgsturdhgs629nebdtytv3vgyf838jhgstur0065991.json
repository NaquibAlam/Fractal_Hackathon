I had all four tires replaced on my minivan and one of my plastic coverings that keeps the metal rubbing against the metal broke. When I contacted Dave about the issue there was no blame game, no runaround, no passing the buck. He promptly ordered the part for me, kept me up-to-date with the delivery of the part and got me in right away to install it. His team did a great job following up and getting the job done the right way. His number one priority was to make sure that I was safe and happy... as a customer I always understand that something can easily break when you're taking something apart but they truly handled that like professionals and made it right with no headaches on my part.\nTown fair tire and Dave will always be my go to for tires.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:24:54.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

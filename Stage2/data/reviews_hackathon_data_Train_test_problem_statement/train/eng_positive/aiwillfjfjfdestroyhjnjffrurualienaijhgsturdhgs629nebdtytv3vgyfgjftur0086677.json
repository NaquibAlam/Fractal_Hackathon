When we decided to sell our boat we decided to give Pop Yachts a try. We didn't have to put up with scams. Diana handled our closing and was so informant she informed us on each step and the complete process. It took a little longer to finalize everything but was well worth it.\nI feel Pop Yachts protects both the buyer and the seller and most of all NO SCAMS.

It was simple to find the best plane tickets for my budget and departure dates. Flighthub gave me a lot of possibilities, which I liked.\nThe insurance (with extra fees) seems to cover a lot of things. The price of the insurance is decent to me. It's also optional, if you are on a tight budget.\nMy only problem was with the seating choices. I find it weird that it costs $15 more just for Flighthub to tell the flying company which kind of seating you'd like. You don't get to chose your actual seat, and you are not granteed the type of seat you chose will be the one you get. But it's an optional fee, so it's not that big of a deal.\nOveral a great experience with the company, I would recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:50:16.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

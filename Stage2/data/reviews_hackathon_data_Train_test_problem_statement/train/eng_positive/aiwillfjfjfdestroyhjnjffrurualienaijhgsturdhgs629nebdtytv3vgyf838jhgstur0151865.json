The sales person who helped us was very knowledgeable. Provided a couple of options within the specs I was looking for, explained the features of each, set them up on tripods and gave me plenty of time to compare. Quickly narrowed the search to two brands. Would probably have been satisfied with either. Both high quality. I purchased the Opticron MM4 50 with the SDL zoom eyepiece. Should fit my intended uses very well.\nHave shopped there before. Always friendly, funny and knowledgeable people. Would do business again and highly recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:23:10.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I designed my business website on WebStarts about 5 years ago and have absolutely no regrets...not one! I have seen some of my business friends struggle with other platforms and then choose to pay thousands because they could not figure it out. WebStarts is simple to use and creates professional looking websites depending on your time, effort and creative ability. For me, I enjoy knowing my site is my site, I can change things, add to or take away at anytime I want without having to contact a web designer and pay them a bundle for a few tweaks here and there. The customer service department is awesome and I love all of the video tutorials. My site ranks well and WebStarts is extremely affordable; they also streamline the process from beginning to end. I highly recommend WedStarts and the only thing I would like to see added is maybe a weekly blog on SEO tips.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T19:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:39:16.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

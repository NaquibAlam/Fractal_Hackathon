I'm convinced our baby-who-would-eat-anything found it and decided it looked tasty enough to eat. Being young and broke we didn't have insurance on it so fast forward 11 years, 2 more kids, and a few homes under our belt, a ring wasn't top priority for us. Then life settled down so we decided to replace it, plus now we are older and wiser (insurance? check!). We hopped online to research how to get a beautiful diamond without the insulting upcharge. Enter Brian Gavin. Blog post after blog post, review after review his diamonds were consistently recommended for best value, cut, brilliance, and shine. I compared his diamonds with other online retailers and was blow away, everyone was right. His diamonds are clean and brilliant! I picked a modest size but best cut diamond from the Black line and a setting that would work well with my small hands. Payment was quick and easy even if you pay with wire transfer like we did (plus you get a discount!). Processing time was the only agonizing part because I had an unexpected trip pop up and wanted to make sure the ring was delivered before I left. Jami, my customer service representative, was a doll and made sure it arrived the morning I left. It took the full 15 business days as promised so if you are impatient like me, take heart! It's worth the wait. I adore my new ring and couldn't be more pleased!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:40:59.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

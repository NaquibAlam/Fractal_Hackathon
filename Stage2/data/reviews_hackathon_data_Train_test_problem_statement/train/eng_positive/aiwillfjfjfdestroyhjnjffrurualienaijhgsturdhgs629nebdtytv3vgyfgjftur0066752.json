I started checking costs on-line. I had never use Carid before. I went to my favorite three on-line contacts. Then I found Carid. Glad a did. They had the pary I needed. Half the cost of the GM dealer. Even better prices than the three other stores I normally order from on-line. Will for sure be using Carid again for my auto parts needs.

I had read the reviews. Some good some not so good. I had booked my car in for a full service and MOT taking advantage of a nice discount. I received confirmation that my car was booked in both via email and text. I had a phone call from the garage on the morning to say they were coming to collect my car and they duly arrived shortly afterwards. I received a phone call from Service Stop to advise that I would incur the extra costs for the Oil (as expected). Unfortunately my car failed the MOT due to a clip that required welding on my exhaust. I was advised the additional cost to fix the issue and agreed to pay. I was sent a link to make the payment that was extremely easy to do. My car was duly returned later and my book had been stamped. All in all a very good experience and all the personell that I liaised with were extremly efficient and very friendly.

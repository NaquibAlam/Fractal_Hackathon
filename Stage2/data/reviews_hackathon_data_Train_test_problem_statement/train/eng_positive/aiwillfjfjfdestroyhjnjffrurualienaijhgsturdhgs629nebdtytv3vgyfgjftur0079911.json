There was no pressure to buy. In fact we looked at several vehicles and wanted time to decide which vehicle was the best choice for us. Our salesperson Marcus LoCascio was very friendly and knowledgeable and never tried to pressure us to buy. We took several days to decide and came back and actually drove a few vehicles to make our final decision. Again never any pressure by any of staff to make a purchase. We did buy a Jeep and are very happy with our choice. I would highly recommend Auto Lenders to any one who is looking for a great used vehicle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:13:35.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

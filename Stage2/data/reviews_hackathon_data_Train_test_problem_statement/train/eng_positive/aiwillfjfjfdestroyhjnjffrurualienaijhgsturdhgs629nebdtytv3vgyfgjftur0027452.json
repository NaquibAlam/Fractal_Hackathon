The selection was far more up-to-date with styles and the pricing often beat the competitors by $20-40, Customer service and char function experience was excellent and definitely customer focused. The only reason I am not sing SmartBuy 5 stars is that twice I selected and paid for eyeglasses frames that I found out afterwards were on back order. I would like to see their inventory display an item is on back order so that you can choose at that time to re-select another pair. Here is what IS excellent. With one day if ordering, I found out my frames were on back order and they offered me a 5% discount if I wanted to re-select another frame. Thanks for being so customer focused SmartBuy Glasses USA!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:14:51.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

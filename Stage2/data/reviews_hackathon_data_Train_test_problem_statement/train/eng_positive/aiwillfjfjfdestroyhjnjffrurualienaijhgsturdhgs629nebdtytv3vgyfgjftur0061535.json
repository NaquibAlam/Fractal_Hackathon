After a couple days, the chair stopped operating all together. I contacted Customer Service and Richard Valdez responded. He helped me narrow down the problem to an electronic part, confirmed it was the right one and promptly sent it out at a reasonable price. This level of service is almost impossible to find these days and I thought I was going to be stuck with an inoperable recliner. Richard, you've made us customers for life...Thank you!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:10:50.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

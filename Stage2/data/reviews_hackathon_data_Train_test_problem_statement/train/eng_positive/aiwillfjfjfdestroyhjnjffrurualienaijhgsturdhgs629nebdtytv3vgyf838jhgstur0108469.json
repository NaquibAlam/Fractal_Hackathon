By 8pm on the Friday, my son was out celebrating his 21st birthday with his friends. UPS couldn't fix, so only option was redelivery on Monday...:(. Bake Me A Wish wasn't open on the weekend, but promptly upon calling on Monday, they did RUSH a new cake out to my son for a Tuesday delivery.\nAll turned out well, although the surprise wasn't timely as wished.

I was the only buyer in the store. Then eventually someone asked is anyone assisting u. When they realised this they swooped to attention then it was great from there.\nI am building a studio i bought the presonus audio box 1818\nI bought tons of equipt to go with 8 headphones mics leads etc.\nI really needed guidance and dj team gave it to me\nSince i keep ordering by phone direct with mike\nMy buy was a pretty tricky and technical but store dj delivered\nThe only other thing was left me vulnerable was there was no real guidance to who or where can teach me the artist studio software. I called store dj and there directions to where to get help was too arduous. But wat i did was i went online using upwork where a lodged a worldwide add asking for a professional to teach me how to use the software. I found a guy 30 year engineer experience and an expert in presonus atudio. Using skype share screen In less than 5 hours he had me operational. 1 song recorded in a week. Cost was about $100\nI think each store should have his name connected to every artist studio sold. Nothing worse than getting a system and not knowing wat to do. It was super depressing until i found him.\nAny way store dj overall great experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:18:38.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

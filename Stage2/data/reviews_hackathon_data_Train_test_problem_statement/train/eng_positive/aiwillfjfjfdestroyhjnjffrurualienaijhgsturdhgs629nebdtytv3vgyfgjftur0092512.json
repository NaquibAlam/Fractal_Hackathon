I started small to see how things would work.\nWithout exception all my orders worked out fine and today I order from them with confidence.\nAlong the years some shipments had trouble arriving, but Banggood's answer to that is a remarkable service team that never lets you down:\n- They spend equal attention to every inquiry, no matter its commercial value.\n- Questions are answered within the day and the answers are to the point and effective.\n- If goods take more time to ship than advertised, they will propose a refund. That has happened well before I could feel my impatience starting.\n- Order processing is carefully monitored: if goods take too long time to ship, they spontaneously refund.\n- If goods don't arrive, they will organize reshipment, no questions asked. That happened to me once with an untracked shipment.\nTypically goods are sent with a working tracking number, I learned from them that most shipments stay longer with customs than they are in transit!\nWhat more could I ask? This is excellent customer service...\nAnd oh, they have also names!\nThank you very much for your great care, Amor, Candice, Chloe, Cherry and Sharon!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:20:22.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After a few failed attempts at a local tire shop I was referred to town fair tire in new London. From the moment I walked in, the experience could not have been easier. Mike helped me find exactly what I was looking for in a great package deal. He triple checked the fitment and size before order. Installation was near perfect, makes the vehicle look fantastic. Wonderful experience, will be going back in the near future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T17:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T09:35:11.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Roberto and his family were excellent hosts. They had answers to all of our questions and quickly resolved any issues that we had. I couldn't have been more impressed.\nThe casa itself is quite comfortable and clean. We enjoyed a freshly prepared breakfast fast each morning at a great price. They were also quick to ask about any dietary restrictions.\nThe bedrooms are spacious and nicely decorated in a contemporary Cuban style. The dining area and the common area are really nice to be in.\nFinally, I have to mention that Roberto and his family are warm and gracious hosts who kindly endured my broken Spanish.\nOh! I should add that the air conditioners work well and there is lots of hot water for showers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:59:36.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

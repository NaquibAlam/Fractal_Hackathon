The app is easy to use and details everything which I like when I am driving, the passangers have been great and always prefer Lyft over Uber I haven't had one suggest otherwise. The Lyft customer service is great too, I always receive a response between 2-24 hours and it's been very convenient. The only thing I would suggest changing is the way Lyft Line works in the app, I almost never hear the notification when a passenger is added to the Line and I am always confused as to why I am being redirected during the trip. If it is possible, it would be great if you can add a voice over in the app that says \"A passenger has been added to your Lyft Line\" only if it's possible since it would help us drivers when navigation like Waze or Google Maps begin to redirect us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:06:25.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

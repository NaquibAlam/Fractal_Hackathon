However, I was pleasantly surprised when my computer arrived in perfect condition. I honestly had a hard time believing that this computer had been refurbished-It looked brand new. I called the company regarding questions and concerns I had regarding the purchase which were all professionally answered by knowledgeable staff. I have and would recommend Macs4U to anyone looking for a Mac-especially at half the price of a new one.\nThanks again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:42:11.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There are a couple great companies out there that do a wonderful job educating one on different machines. After almost purchasing a couple machines I landed on WholeLatteLove and the Gaggia Brera and bought.\nLove this machine. Great features and usability for the price. (replace a nicer Breville)\nThe on-line how-to videos WholeLatteLove produces are priceless. From operating to descaling. Great step by step and tips. If I have a question, I just pull up a video. They even include text instructions, which as so appreciated when descaling the first time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T14:09:28.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

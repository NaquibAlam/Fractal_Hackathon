I called and was told it would be 35.00 to overnight a replacement for monday. On monday UPS did not deliver. I went to the service center on tuesday and once again Ups could not locate the device and my truck timed out while at the service center. I had to leave ot there and find a ride home. Customer Service had to transfer me to an account rep. I was told that they would credit my account the 35.00 and send a replacement unit out next day air so i could get it on wednesday. Well today the unit did show up and i got to drive my truck home. However tonight i noticed a charge for intoxaloc on my credit card. I logged into my account to discover that they had charged me for next day air!\nRecieved call back from Intoxaloc, credited my account and apologized for the issue. Very n8ce and understanding. Most companies would not have done that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T23:41:57.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The boat, the Sea Spirit, is the perfect size for maximizing shore landings and (optional) sea kayaking.\nThe crew and their staff are very service-oriented. And the expedition staff, including the expedition leader, are knowledgeable, organized and, most importantly, extremely passionate about everything and anything concerning Antarctica. We found their passion rubbed off on us and enhanced our experience immensely.\nPoseidon didn't just \"go through the motions\", but was constantly looking at route options for the benefit of the passengers. For example, on our trip,\nPoseidon went beyond its normal route to circumnavigate a tabular iceberg at the end of the Peninsula that was 4.5 km in circumference! Amazing!\nFinally, while the passages across the Drake Passage took up to two days, they were hardly boring as the expedition experts held numerous educational sessions on many subjects ranging from birds to glaciology to Antarctic history.\nA trip of a lifetime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:13:39.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

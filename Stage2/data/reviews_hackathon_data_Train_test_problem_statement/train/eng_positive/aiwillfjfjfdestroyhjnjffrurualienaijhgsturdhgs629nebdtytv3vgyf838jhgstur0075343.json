This is a big site with many opportunities, which is good and bad at the same time. Some sits have many applications and the owners don't always take time to respond, which can be a bit frustrating. Most owners do respond politely and timely, even if you have been unsuccessful in a particular application. We have had many wonderful experiences sitting via this site and have met many lovely people, looked after some special pets and stayed in some lovely homes. We have mainly undertaken sits in UK so far, but now we have many good references, we plan to try some international locations this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:53:00.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Shortly after I made the online purchase of a fridge freezer, I was phoned by a friendly and helpful ao.com agent to go over the delivery arrangements and any queries I might have. I was texted at about 7am on the morning of the delivery and given a 4-hour time-slot. Tracking was regularly updated online during that window and a named driver contacted me before arriving. The two delivery men were very nice and unpacked my appliance and put it in place. The packing and old fridge freezer were removed as arranged. A smooth operation.

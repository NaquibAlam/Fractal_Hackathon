We had carpet put in 2 rooms last month and once again, the rooms look great. One thing that I recently learned, is that they also sell Hunter Douglas products. I was looking for cellular shades and vertical blinds for the kitchen and wasn't finding what I wanted at the \"big box stores\". Someone suggested Hunter Douglas, so I went on the Hunter Douglas website, to see where I could purchase them and saw Independent Carpet One on the list. The shades have been installed and look great. There was an issue with the measurement on the verticals, so they were too small. The replacements have been ordered and should be in soon. A slight delay, but hey, things happen. It's how a company responds to a problem, is what's important to me. I highly recommend Independent Carpet One for your flooring and window needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T03:05:02.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

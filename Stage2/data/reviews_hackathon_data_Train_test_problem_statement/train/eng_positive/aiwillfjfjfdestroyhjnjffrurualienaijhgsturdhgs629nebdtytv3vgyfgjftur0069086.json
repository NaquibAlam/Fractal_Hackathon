Absolutely delighted with the furniture. It's very well made using lovely wood and fits beautifully in our small cottage (it's difficult to find well-made things for smaller houses). I've since been to the showroom in Banbury to look at the range and I wasn't disappointed. I shall definitely be returning for dining and bedroom furniture in the near future. Your staff in Banbury were very helpful and friendly. Well done!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:12:56.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We initially went in on a Saturday to have a look and quick chat about the vehicle, but we had no intention on that day of purchasing a car. That being said Tom introduced himself, answered all our questions, took us for a test drive and gave us some prices to look over, giving us his whole genuine attention even though we couldn't make him a sale at that point! We returned a few weeks later to see Tom and did the deal on the new car. We mentioned we hadn't been down the new car purchase road for a while so we were unsure of all the details involved etc. Tom made the experience so easy and even had all extras, tires, snorkel, rust proofing etc all good to go on collection date. All other people that we crossed paths with were always friendly and helpful. We have been stoked with our purchase and with Ford. Tom is an asset to your business!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:07:50.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This is my first one. This is my second time booking through this site and I absolutely love the savings I've received with Book It. I saved over $600 dollars for booking through them verses booking through the actual website of Royalton Resorts and I was so amazed of how much cheaper it was. I will only book through Book It for all of my vacations. All of the other 3rd party sites were extremely expensive.

One of the shipping companies that deliver Amazon order is horrible. My friend and I experienced the same how postman never rang the bell and claimed that they did.\nThey left a note for us to pick up the package order at the post office which the package was not there. There was one time that I ordered and I had to keep going back to the post office 5 days in a row. This shipping company left a note telling me to pick up my package that they never dropped it there!!\nI reported to Amazon. They listened and sent me voucher to apologize although it was not really their fault. It's horrible service from this shipping company. However, Amazon is responsible to take of this problem whether solving this problem with this shipping company seriously or changing the shipping company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:26:20.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

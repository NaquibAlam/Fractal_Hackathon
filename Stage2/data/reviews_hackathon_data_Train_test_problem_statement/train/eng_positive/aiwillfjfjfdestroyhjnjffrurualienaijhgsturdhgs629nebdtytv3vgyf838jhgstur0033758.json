What Goway booked for me was very good, but there was definitely a lack of communication in some instances, and ambiguity about what Goway was booking (and was included in the price) and what wasn't. And the itinerary was missing information (I'm still waiting for an answer to one email although I'm now back in Canada). Also, I ended up doing two of basically the same side trip, I don't remember my consultant pointing this out to me and yes, I missed it too, but I was depending on the travel expert as I had never been to Australia before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:18:59.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

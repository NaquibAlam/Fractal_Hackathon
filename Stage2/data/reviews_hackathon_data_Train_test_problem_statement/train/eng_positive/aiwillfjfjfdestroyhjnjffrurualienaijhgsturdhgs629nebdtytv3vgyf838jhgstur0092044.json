They were ver clear and capable in their service and the product came out great.\nThe only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because I had sent them a graphic that was too small. When they tried to expand it, it looked horrible.\nThey shrunk the image to a doable size (As professionals would) but made the cover look really small with the total space. I would have hoped they would call and ask the question, did I mean to have it that small? None the less, they did send a proof and I somehow did not pay attention to that graphic and approved it. Thus I was stuck with my product. I did call and they did show me the problem and my mistake. I sent them the correct image for my next order.\nOver all, I am very pleased.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:02:50.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

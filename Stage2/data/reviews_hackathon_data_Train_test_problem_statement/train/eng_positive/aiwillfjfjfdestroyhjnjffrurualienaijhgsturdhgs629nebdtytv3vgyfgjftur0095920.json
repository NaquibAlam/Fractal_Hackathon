As of this review, we have had 2 house sitters. Both times our dogs were well loved and fed. We have a very anxious dog and I was concerned about how successful she would be with a \"stranger\". Since the house sitters were dog lovers they quickly won her over. My house was always left in perfect condition and maybe a little better than the way we left it. I can't wait for our next trip! I feel so relieved that we now can get away more often and there will be wonderful people in our home to take care of our dogs!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:48:39.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

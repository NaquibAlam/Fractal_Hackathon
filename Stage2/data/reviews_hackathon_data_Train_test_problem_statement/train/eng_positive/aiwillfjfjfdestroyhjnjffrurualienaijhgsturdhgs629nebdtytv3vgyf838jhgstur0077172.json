In short:\nI stumbled upon Brilliance.com after doing a couple Google searches to find the perfect center diamond for my 35th Wedding Anniversary. I called up Brilliance and was immediately helped by John Rios. He spent a ton of time with me explaining the 4C’s and what to look for (and what not to look for) when purchase a diamond.\nAfter a couple of phone calls/emails I ended up purchasing a 2 carat Emerald cut loose diamond that was GIA certified. When I received the diamond I took it to a local appraiser who valued the stone at nearly 65% more then what I paid for it. When I called John to thank him for his service and advice he asked me what I was doing for a setting and convinced me to let him Quote: out a vintage ring design modeled after a design my wife showed me when we were dating (over 35 years ago).\nJust like with the diamond purchase, John took the time to work with me on the setting and his team designed and made my wife’s ring. When I got the finished ring back in my hands I was blown away with the detail/finish of the ring. Additionally going with Brilliance saved me thousands! No question about it… I will never shop for a diamond or ring anywhere else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:24:26.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

TopTal definitely isn't the cheapest option when it comes to online freelancers. But it is, hands down, the best value for money I've found in nearly half a decade of professional online work.\nFinding and vetting freelancers is a huge pain in the butt. Especially when you're on deadline, or need something done quickly. How do you know who's good? How do you know you'll get your money's worth?\nTopTal solves both these problems quickly and effectively. When it comes to recruiting, they have professional project managers who review your needs and line up interviews with qualified designers and developers they think will be a good fit (based on personality, background, skills, location, availability, cost, etc). You can trust the potential hire knows what they're doing, since TopTal has a RIGOROUS vetting process that every designer must go through. Only about one in thirty actually make the cut.\nSo TopTal's entire candidate pool is the best of the best.\nNow, I'm a bit biased. Full disclosure, I'm a TopTal qualified front-end developer. But I run my own consulting practice, and sometimes clients come to me for help filling key roles on their team. They need designers, or developers with specific skills, and aren't sure where to look. TopTal is the only place I feel comfortable recommending.\nThe reasons are simple. First, I went through their vetting process, so I know how good everyone has to be just to get in the door. Second, it's risk-free, which puts my clients at ease (see below). And finally, they make me look good. I've never gotten a single complaint from anyone who opted for a TopTal contractor. Mostly, people can't believe how good the work is.\nBut if you're still skeptical (or nervous, as I was when first hiring for a client) you don't have to worry about losing your money (or your client's money) on the wrong pick because you get a trial period with the contractor of your choice. If they don't deliver, TopTal covers the bill, and works to find you someone else.\nRecently, a client asked me to help him fill a role within his company. The role is part design, part development, with a dose of strategy and copywriting mixed in. I worked with Michael Devries and his team to identify a pool of candidates, and our first pick--Rafael--blew our minds. The client is more than pleased, and has no doubt that he's getting at least a 30-50X return on the investment he's making with Rafael. Probably quite a bit more over the years.\nIf you want something done cheaply, look elsewhere. But if you want it done right; If you want it done by professionals who know what they're doing, communicate well, work fast, deliver on time, and ship excellent work all at an extremely fair price then I recommend giving TopTal a trial run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:16:24.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

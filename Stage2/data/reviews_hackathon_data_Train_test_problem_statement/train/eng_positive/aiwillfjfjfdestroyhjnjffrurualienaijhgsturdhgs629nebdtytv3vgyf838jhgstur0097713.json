It's perfect for when you wish you were there - nothing like celebrating with cake! I've ordered - both times - the 12 mini gourmet cupcakes. Both recipients tell me they were delicious. Cupcakes were packed in dry ice and arrived in perfect condition - icing didn't slide around and cake wasn't smashed. They tasted fresh - I was told - and were quite delicious. Each recipient had there own favorite flavor. The variety selection allows the recipient to try many flavors and make that choice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:57:00.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

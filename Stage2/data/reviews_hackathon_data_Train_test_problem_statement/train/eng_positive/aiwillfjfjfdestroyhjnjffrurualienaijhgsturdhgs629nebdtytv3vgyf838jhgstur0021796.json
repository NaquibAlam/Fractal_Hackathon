I used a few other sites to design business cards, and had one set printed by a lesser company. Those \"other\" cards are cheap, flimsy, pixelated, and easily show wear at the cut edges. They arrived in a large cardboard box stuffed with shipping paper to keep the cards tucked in a corner, so the edges of almost all of the cards are already scuffed :(\nI decided to give Moo a try, despite the slightly higher price point. After receiving my Moo cards, however, I will NEVER order from another company again! Here are my thoughts:\nPROS\n* you can order a sample pack with all of your options -- warning, this can make selection even harder because they are all gorgeous!\n* website is well designed, very pretty/modern, and easily navigated\n* uploading your designs is simple and their FAQ straightforwardly explain what settings/measurements to use\n* their cards are fantastic quality -- I ordered both the Moo sized Luxe cards with rounded edges and the Moo sized Spot Gloss cards with rounded edges\n* the Luxe cards are gorgeous, they are sort of a semi-gloss finish (so be prepared for that if you want a super glossy card) and have a nice subtly textured finish -- they also have a great heft to them and I LOVE the color detail on the edges (I chose green and it's wonderful)\n* my favorite though is definitely the Spot Gloss cards -- I ordered them on a whim just to see if I liked the way they worked, and they are FABULOUS! I definitely recommend these for that extra little POP to your cards! (also great instructions in the FAQ re: how to create your own design)\n* as if they weren't already awesome, they Quote: d me an estimated delivery date of Feb 14 and they arrived FOUR DAYS earlier! (didn't pay for expedited or anything)\n* lastly, they arrived packaged in great little storage boxes to keep all of your cards safe and pretty\nCONS\n* the only con I can speak of is cost -- and honestly I work in a field where you get what you pay for -- so if you want a nice set of very good quality business cards that will reflect upon your business well and impress future clients, Moo cards are worth the investment!\nI'm excited to design other products from the Moo collection now, I have no doubt I will continue to be satisfied.

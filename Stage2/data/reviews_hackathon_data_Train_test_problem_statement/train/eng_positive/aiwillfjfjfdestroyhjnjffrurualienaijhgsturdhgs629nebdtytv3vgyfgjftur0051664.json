I was looking for an asset class to add additional diversification since most of my holdings were in equities and real estate. Whenever world events led to periods of uncertainty, it was reassuring to have money in something as stable as gold. With recent world events, I’ve just added to my position today.\nOver the past 20 years, I’ve seen other gold and silver dealers come and go, and I’m just happy that I’ve stuck with a precious metals retailer who has always been there. I’ve placed over 30 orders with Kitco, and the process from buying online to having the product delivered has been flawless.\nI particularly like their option to add products to an IRA. I like to think of this as my “Golden Nest Egg”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:05:16.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

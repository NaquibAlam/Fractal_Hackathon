I had a question today and used the help chat which was quick and effective. So far my experience is mostly positive. I think the should allow you to skip the following month starting the 27th or 28th (except Feb) so that you have a full week time frame to skip that month. I absolutely LOVE almost everything i've gotten and I would say my only complaint is some pant seem to be much tighter than others all in the same size range. But reviews are very helpful and if you try it right away it's easy to return things you need a different size on or all together for credit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:12:43.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was looking for a new speaker from B&O and found it recently on Amazon for the same price - but it was not released yet to Amazon, happily I forgot to check B&H (it's been about one year since I made last purchase) and I found it in stock and ready to ship.\nOver the years I have purchase several Roland keyboards, Kawai VPC-1, amplifiers, assorted speakers. music equipment, many items for a home music studio, even a large venue projector - most items arriving in only 1 day (New York to Massachusetts ).\nNever was I less than completely satisfied with the availability of items and with my final purchase; Product information on the site is excellent, B&H is an authorized dealer for the items and I know they will back it up if I had any problem. And the items arrive in perfect condition the shipping department does not skimp to make sure the product is not damaged in transit.\nHighly recommended for electronics and music studio items for home or professional - the one time I had a return (not satisfied with a projector - the old DLP rainbow issue) my return was handled quickly and I was completely satisfied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:01:57.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The booking process was very easy, had to wait for car rental company to confirm availability, and this was done within 12 hours. Autonom.ro was the local rental company, and they are very professional and reliable. Their vehicles are kept in very good roadworthy condition. Their staff are very helpful and customer focused. I found the sum of EUR 1020 being blocked as \"Excess guarantee\" a little high, however, this can be protected by purchasing another bit of insurance. You'd be a fool not to, however, this makes the overall car rental price higher than initial face value. It is however all open and \"on show\", so there are no hidden surprises. I would recommend rentalcars.com without hesitation. I guess the rest of the rental experience is down to the local rental company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:44:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

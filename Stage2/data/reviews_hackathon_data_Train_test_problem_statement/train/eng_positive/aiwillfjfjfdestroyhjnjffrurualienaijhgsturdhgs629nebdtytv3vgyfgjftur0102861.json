I do wish they had a little more variety for people who aren't tiny like more high waisted pants, longer shorts & high impact bras. The quality of the clothing is great and the website is very easy to use. People always comment on how great the clothes look cos they are different and fit well. I would recommend becoming a VIP customer cos the perks are worth it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:24:03.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

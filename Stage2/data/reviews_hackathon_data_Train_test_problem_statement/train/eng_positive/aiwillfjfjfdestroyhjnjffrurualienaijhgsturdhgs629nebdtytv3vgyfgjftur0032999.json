I must be able to get on this particular flight for 2 reasons, one is to attend a funeral our of country and the second is to be the travelling aid for my friend with disabilities so I needed to book for the same flight without knowing I was only on standby and may not make the flight.\nI found that it was very easy to use the sight and was able to book my flight in a very quick time. I did run into one issue and that was my fault, I gave the wrong expiration date on my credit card. I had the confirmation of my booking and within 15 minutes I received a call from the people at Flight Network to inform me of this and we had this error corrected within a few minutes and the electronic ticket receipt was waiting within the next hour for me to print off.\nWould I recommend this site to others ---YES-- just as it was recommended to me .\nRespectfully\nSharon D in Calgary", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:01:29.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

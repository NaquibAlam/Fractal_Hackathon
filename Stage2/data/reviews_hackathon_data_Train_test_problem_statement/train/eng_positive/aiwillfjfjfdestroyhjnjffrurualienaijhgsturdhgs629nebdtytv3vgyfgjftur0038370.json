One of the worse symptoms is run-on thoughts... in my case, I can't stop thinking about the many mistakes that I have made over the years... things that I have done that hurt people that I care about. These thoughts chase themselves like a hamster in a revolving cage, making it impossible to sleep.\nPhenibut puts a stop to this. I have to say that I take twice the recommended dose, and that when I run out of it I suffer for a few nights. I worry that even writing a review like this may advance the day that it becomes a scheduled drug, like Xanax. I never take it unless I am home for the night, and I try not to drink any alcohol but that is sometimes impossible for me. Alcohol multiplies the effects of Phenibut.\nCompared to pharmaceutical drugs and street drugs, Phenibut from Liftmode is a bargain! If you suffer from anxiety, depression or insomnia you owe it to yourself to try it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:19:31.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

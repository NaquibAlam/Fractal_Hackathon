Initially, I rated the company on the low end and filled in the form accordingly. To my surprise, In the background the the company was actually working quite hard to complete my purchase.\nThe company notified me of their efforts and that they were unhappy about my rating both directly and through Trustpilot. Trustpilot kept me informed throughout this process AND their site allowed me to revise my rating of the company.\nIt is impressive to find a company such as Trustpilot that follows a transaction end to end. I am certain their users are quite please with people and a company so professional.\nJohn Dillon", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T10:58:10.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

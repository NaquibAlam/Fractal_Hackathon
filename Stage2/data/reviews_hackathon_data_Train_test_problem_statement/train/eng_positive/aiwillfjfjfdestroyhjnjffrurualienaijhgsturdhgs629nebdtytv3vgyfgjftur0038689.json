Lendio and its representatives came through for me in spectacular fashion. I was able to obtain both business and personal credit lines that allowed me to order merchandise to be fully stocked ahead of our opening. It did not stop there, though! They offer counseling to maximize my credit profile to ensure I can continue obtaining financing as my business grows. The confidence with which Lendio handled my application was a relief.

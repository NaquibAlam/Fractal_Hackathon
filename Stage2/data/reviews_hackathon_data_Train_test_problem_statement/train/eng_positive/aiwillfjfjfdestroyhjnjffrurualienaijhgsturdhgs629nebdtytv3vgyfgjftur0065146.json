I learned about Clean Republic and I started saving my pennies. I have a DS 8.3 Trek bike, 24 speed. I purchased the 36v 350w model in early Feb 2017. I LOVE IT!!! Installation was simple, I had watched the youtube installation videos many times. I had talked with my bike shop and asked about the front fork. They had told me that I shouldn't have any problems. I really like the variable slide throttle. I've purchased a 150v dc meter to gauge the battery while I'm on the trails. I've had it out a few times and used it with both pedal assist and battery only. No problems. I would recommend this kit to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T22:44:51.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

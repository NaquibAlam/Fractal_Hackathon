We decided to go to Costa Rica less than a month and a half before we actually left the week before Christmas, and Rebecca was incredible pulling it all together beautifully. I had never used an agency such as this before, and initially I wasn't sure if I could trust them to do what they said they would do. Through working with Rebecca, I soon discovered they were completely legit and everything did work out as they promised. From the beginning Rebecca gave us plenty of ideas considering our timing, family and budget needs, and was VERY patient as I changed my mind multiple times -- Including switching two entire days of activities and accommodations from the final schedule when I threw a wrench into the plans. She was so solicitous with my many questions and any concerns I had. We LOVED the excursion tours they booked us with, and the accommodations were great. It was so helpful working with someone who LIVES in and KNOWS the country. I also connected with several other consultants when Rebecca was not available, and they were terrific as well. We only had two blips on the vacation - one with a pick up for an excursion (the excursion company picked up someone else in our place and left prior to our meeting time), and one when the rain precluded entry into the Arenal state park. Both issues were remedied, and we really loved our last minute change of activity to the hanging bridges on the rainy day. We hope to return to Costa Rica one day, and would not hesitate for a moment using Costa Rican Vacations again to help us with our trip. We've already passed on their name to others and will continue to do so!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:49:33.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I had a friend who'd recently gotten married tell me about the budget tool specifically, but after actually signing up for the website and seeing all the available information the help, I fell in love.\nThe website creation tool was easy to use and so cute. Very helpful as I didn't use response cards, but just had people RSVP through the website. The only thing I can say is that the website creation tool IS NOT easily compatible with Internet Explorer. That was a bit of a pain, but the rest was great.\nI loved the checklist and the ability to change dates as well as add/remove items to the list. So helpful to stay on track. I didn't have a wedding planner, so it was great to have something that would gently lead me by the hand so I didn't forget anything.\nThe guest list tool was easy to use and made keeping track of RSVPs easy.\nThe budget tool was my best friend. You could add payments and when they were due. It really kept me in check.\nI cannot say enough about how much thought has gone into making WeddingWire easy for couples to use! Thank you SO MUCH!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T16:33:46.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

He has had a rough road of medications and side effects. We were at a loss as to what to do. NOTHONG worked and the side effects were horrible on his little body. As a mom I cried nightly because I couldn't help him. Until we found a collaborative care clinic that recommended cbd oil. Huge difference!! He can think and comprehend what he is thinking. Amazing results and he is so happy now that his brain isn't running all the time. I 100% recommend Endoca for their product! It is safe, reliable company and fast shipping!! I trust them with my child's oil and his health. Thank you Endoca for giving my son and I relief!!a", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:23:11.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

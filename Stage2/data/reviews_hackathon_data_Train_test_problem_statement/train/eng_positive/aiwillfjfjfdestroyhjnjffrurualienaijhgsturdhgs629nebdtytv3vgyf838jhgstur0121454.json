It solved my problem in going from south of Dublin to the city center to buy the food for my dog (the only place I can find the brand my dogs eats).Besides, they are really in time to deliver the product and as I spend more than 30 euro I dont pay the delivery. Besides, they have the products for cleaning that I need. I also like how easy and secure is the website, I can order the things really quickly.

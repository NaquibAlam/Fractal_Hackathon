I stumbled across the site online for OneSim Card nearly 2 years ago. This was my second year in using their services and I will continue to use OneSim Card each and every time I travel. The rates are excellent and the customer service is second to none. There are many options which allows one to customize and purchase the Sim card that suits your needs. The number of countries available is impressive!. I would never travel abroad using my cell phone now without purchasing a OneSim card plan. Thank you OneSim Card Services for the great service!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:00:46.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

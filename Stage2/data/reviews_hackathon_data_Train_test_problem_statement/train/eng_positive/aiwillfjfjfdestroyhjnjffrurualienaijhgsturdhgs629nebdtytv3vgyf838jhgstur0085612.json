Globus booked us into very nice hotels with excellent restaurants. Our only complaint was not with Globus but with the road department in Mexico. They were putting in a new highway and do not operate like the US. We were on a dirt road for about three hours. Tour buses and semi-trucks should never been allowed on that road. I think the tour director was almost as shocked as we were. Nevertheless The Copper Canyon is spectacular and well worth seeing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:09:33.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This company gets 5 stars for the training of their associates which is the best service I've ever encountered. I had to make changes to my order and not once did I feel like I was being questioned about my concerns. With the Saatva company the customer is always right. My original order consisted of a Luxury firm 14.5 queen mattress and box spring. The platform frame that I purchased elsewhere did not fit the box spring, Saatva understood and gave me a full refund without hassles. The Luxury firm mattress was a little to soft for my sleeping comfort so I requested the firm mattress. I was given an apology that the Luxury firm was not a good fit and within 2 weeks my new firm mattress arrived. This mattress is perfect! The firm mattress still has a softness, but is firm and does not feel like sleeping on a board. The delivery drivers were courteous and very careful bringing mattress in my home. I will tell anyone who is looking for a new mattress about the Saatva company. I will replace every mattress in my home with Saatva mattresses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:28:42.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

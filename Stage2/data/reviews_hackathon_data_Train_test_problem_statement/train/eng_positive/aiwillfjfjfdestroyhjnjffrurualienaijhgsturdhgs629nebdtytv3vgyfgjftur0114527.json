The clothes and accessories are so cute. It's my favorite online store to browse; I could spend hours just scrolling. The layout of the website is also very straight-forward and easy to navigate. The only negative thing about this store I suppose is that the quality of the product sometimes is bad. Recently, I received a low quality dress that was absolutely nothing like the dress I ordered: the material, the sleeves, the dress itself was of a different design entirely. But you can just send a message about that to have it replaced or exchanged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:18:38.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

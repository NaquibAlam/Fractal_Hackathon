Their service is quick and the units are modestly priced. I ordered the Mommy wig which is part of the Janet collection. The unit is soft there was a bit shedding with this unit but it was soft to the touch. I was a bit surprised and someone disappointed the wig and color I choose was so dark it didn't work well with golden Carmel skin tone. Other than that if Eleveted had my color in stock I would the mommy wig again. But instead I order the insta fab wig from amazon in my signature gold color.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T21:46:21.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

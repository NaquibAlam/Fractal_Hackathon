I would define the experience of relocation with 'Universal relocations' as perfect & professional. Right from Move manager to co-coordinator and of course the guys who pack and move the package are very professional.\nYou can hire them and relax, rest is taken care by universal relocations.\nSince i liked the service very much, i would like to even suggest universal relocations to enable 'SMS' or 'Email triggering' the event of movement of package. This would be very helpful in tracking the package and it will add feathers to 'universal relocations' services.\nOverall very satisfied relocation experience:-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T13:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:53:07.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

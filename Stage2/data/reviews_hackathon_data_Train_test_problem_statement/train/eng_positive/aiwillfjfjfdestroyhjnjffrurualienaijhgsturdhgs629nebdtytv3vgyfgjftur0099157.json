Unfortunately, the door and ramp mechanism have had issues since nearly Day 1. The customer service people at Bussani in Mamaroneck have always been very helpful, and the door has been adjusted and fixed multiple times over the past 4 1/2 years. The primary customer service person- Darcey Pineda- is fantastic. She is extremely responsive, thoughtful and is always concerned with getting the van fixed. This van now has gone tens of thousands of miles, and although the \"door issue\" continues to happen from time to time, the van has otherwise worked reasonably well for us. Bussani is a good company, and we especially appreciate the thoughtful, caring service of the Mamaroneck office. Thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T14:51:28.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

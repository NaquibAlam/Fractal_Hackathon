I love the \"dashed\" feature as it's very convenient and useful and gives live tracking. Also, there don't seem to be any markups on the food from the store prices. Finally, if there is ever an issue, Foodler support is always responsive and very helpful! I will keep on using Foodler for a very long time!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T14:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T23:45:07.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

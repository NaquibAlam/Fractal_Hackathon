We found Enchanting Travels on a web search but the phone conversations that followed confirmed our interest in choosing them as our custom tour guide. They delivered exactly what we wanted. Our trip lasted 30 days! We were able to modify daily schedules, times of travel, locations, food, activities. Your driver is available to you day and night so they will take you to see sunsets, or to a restaurant and wait for you to bring you home. They arranged a cooking class with a lovely woman who allowed us into her home, drove us to the market to buy fresh vegetables, then back to her home to prepare a wonderful indian dinner.\nWe spent our last week at an Ayurvedic Health Resort (Somatheeram) which ET found for us (not the usual request). It was just what we were looking for... a blend of meditation, yoga, diet, massage, and ayurvedic medical treatments.\nBest trip of my life!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:02:22.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

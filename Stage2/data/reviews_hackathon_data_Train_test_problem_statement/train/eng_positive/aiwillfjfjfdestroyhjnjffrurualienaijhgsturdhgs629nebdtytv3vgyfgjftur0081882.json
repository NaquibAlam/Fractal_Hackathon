With less than a month's notice he worked within our budget to provide incredible accommodation options and a wide variety of activities to choose from. Prior to selecting Costa Rican Vacations, I researched several other companies, and CRV is by far a better value for your dollar. More importantly, the relationships they've established in Costa Rica would have to be the primary reason for their success!! Also, my travel dates changed, and Aaron was immediate to update changes, without additional charges, so flexibility is also a key reason to work with Costa Rican Vacations.\nOur travel within Costa Rica was seamless (it was so relaxing not to worrying about renting a car etc...). Our 8 nights in Costa Rica were some of the most cherished travel adventures to date. We look forward to planning a future adventure with Costa Rican Vacations!\n*During our adventure in Costa Rica my son became ill (as it turns out, nothing serious), but I called Aaron, and the response from him as well as the additional travel team, was remarkable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:28:05.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I did assemble a couple of boxes that had an end that was 1/8\" short and was going to leave a gap between boxes, so I cut them down and built quilt boxes out of them. Solid boxes, easy to finish. Brushy Mtn. offers lots of accessory type items like slatted racks, wooden hivetop feeders, and queen castles - a big plus. The people there are very helpful, especially when I call on the phone. Will be going back for more 8 frame medium hives this spring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:00:41.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

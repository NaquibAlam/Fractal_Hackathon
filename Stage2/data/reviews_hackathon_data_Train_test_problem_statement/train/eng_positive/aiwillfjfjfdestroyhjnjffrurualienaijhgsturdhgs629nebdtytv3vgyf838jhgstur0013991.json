After clicking over to \"NextAdvisor\" I read a very well thought out review of the credit card in question. In fact, after the review \"NextAdvisor\" supplies more reviews of credit cards commensurate with the primary card they were headlining. Ironically, all of the 0% APR credit cards are for those fortunate enough to have good to excellent credit. I never see any headlines for credit cards with 0% or low APR for those who have fair to bad credit who want to transfer their balances away from \"Mafia-like\" credit cards issuers charging between 36% and 50% APR.\n\"NextAdvisor\" does have credit card reviews for individuals with less than stellar credit scores but it doesn't seem to want to highlight this type of credit card on Yahoo as much as it does for the individual with the good to excellent credit score. The credit card reviews for individuals with fair or bad credit you have to search for on their website.\nIf \"NextAdvisor\" could help shine the spotlight on credit cards and credit card issuers on Yahoo who are looking for individuals with fair to bad credit who want to lower their balances by transferring over to a credit card which has a low or zero APR for twelve to eighteen months if the individual can zero out the balance in this time-frame. Afterwards the credit card issuer will keep the APR at a very low or zero APR or raise the APR to, say, 18 to 24% APR. \"Discover It\" and \"Citi Simplicity\" are not going to award their credit cards to fair or bad credit applicants. There are credit card issuers who may want to take a chance on the individual who has regained a steady job/career and is trying to rebuild themselves financially by way of paying off their credit balances.\n\"NextAdvisor\" has knowledge of these credit card issuers who are willing to take a chance on an individual with a less than stellar credit score. \"NextAdvisor\", as a public service, should publicize these credit card issuers so individuals can rebuild their credit and become one of those individuals \"NextAdvisor\" is always pining for with 0% credit card offers for those with \"great\" or \"excellent\" credit scores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T11:00:50.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

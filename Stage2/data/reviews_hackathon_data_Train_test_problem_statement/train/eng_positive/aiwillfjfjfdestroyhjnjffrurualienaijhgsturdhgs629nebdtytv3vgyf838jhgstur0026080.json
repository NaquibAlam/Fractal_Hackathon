We arranged the time off and started to look for a guided tour of Venice, Rome and Amalfi Coast. We contacted Firebird Tours and they put a wonderful tour together in just a few days. Firebird Tours arranged hotel reservations and guided tours to these cities plus transport across Italy. We could not have asked for a better experience . The guides, drivers, and hotels were first rate and there were no loose ends. I would readilly recommend this company to anyone. Thanks Sim at Firebird Tours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:52:55.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

If you are willing to do a little bit of work you will save thousands in agent's fees. More importantly you will be in full control of the dialogue between you and interested buyers. The free ebook detailing the selling process was very helpful. PropertyNow responded to my emails quickly and were always available on the phone. The uploading of details to the main realestate websites occurred in a prompt manner. Very happy indeed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:56:20.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

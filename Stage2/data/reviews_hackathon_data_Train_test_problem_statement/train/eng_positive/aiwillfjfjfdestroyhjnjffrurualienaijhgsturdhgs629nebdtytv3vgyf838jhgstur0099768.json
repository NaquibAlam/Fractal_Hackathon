The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there was a lack of understanding and information provided in the decision on choosing between slim line jewel cases and the traditional jewel cases. If I had known everything before that I know now about those 2 options, I would have chosen differently. Seems like they should have had more understanding to give me more information in that decision. Otherwise, I was very pleased.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:02:58.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

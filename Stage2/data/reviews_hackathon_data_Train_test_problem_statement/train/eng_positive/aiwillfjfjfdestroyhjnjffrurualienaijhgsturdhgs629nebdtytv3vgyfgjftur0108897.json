I am not so happy with the call center. I filled out a reservation form online clearly stating when I wanted to rent the unit. The next day I got a call from the call center and rent started that day, not the day I had requested which was a week out. So I had to pay rent for that extra week that I didn't want. I told the representative that I didn't want the unit yet but he said I had already rented it and that he couldn't change it. I thought this was a really cheap trick to get more rent out of people!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:46:11.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

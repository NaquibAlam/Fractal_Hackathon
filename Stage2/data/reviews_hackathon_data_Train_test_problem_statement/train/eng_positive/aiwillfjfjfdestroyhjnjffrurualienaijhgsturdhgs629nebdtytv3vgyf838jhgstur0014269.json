This one isn't quite \"holy\", but it is nearly the Grail.\nThe major tools are on Y-wrenches, better than the fold-out multi-tools (in my opinion). The only bits (stored in one of the tool compartments) I need are the screwdriver ones - no torx nor itsy-bitsy allens on my bike. I appreciate the fact that this means fewer little pieces to lose on the roadside. The bit driver appears to my digital micrometer to use 1/4\" drive hex bits, widely available.\nCrank Brothers sells the 8-mm and 10-mm sockets from their Pika+ separately, and this tool can use them, so my olde byke nuts will use those; I will just re-arrange the little bit of sandpaper and the stick-on patches (or not carry them, relying on a \"real\" patch kit), to create space for the 8 and 10.\nHas nice little foam rubber pad fillers for the tool compartments to eliminate rattles.\nIt would be better if ... it had a 1/4\" square drive, as used on socket wrench sets, on one of the arms. That would enable Many other sizes and kinds of bits and wrenches to interface.\nThis is a good tool even at list price. The every-so-often promotional price from BTD made it that much sweeter of a deal. Value-wise, it beats the ultra-cheapo ebay $3.99 all-steel mini-boat-anchor fold-out ones by a mile or two.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T06:35:13.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

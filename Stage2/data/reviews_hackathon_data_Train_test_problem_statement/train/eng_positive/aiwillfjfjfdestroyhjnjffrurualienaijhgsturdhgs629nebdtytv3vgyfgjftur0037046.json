However, my photos were rejected when I submitted my application, so I was looking for an alternative place to just have the photos taken when I found mypassportphotos.com. I was skeptical, but sent the photos and paid extra to have any necessary editing done. I was delighted to get an email saying they would be at my local drugstore within two hours. I picked them up and they look great. All ready to cut to size and attach to the application. What a great service. Couldn't be easier.

Small point: the sample of the blind we chose had a large check pattern. The sample completely missed the large check so was potentially misleading.\nThe blinds themselves are very nice supplied with all the fittings needed. My biggest gripe was the fitting instructions which have to be downloaded after entering your order number. By the time you have done this and printed the one sheet of paper it is 10-15 minutes wasted. It seems stingy not to send them. Just one sheet. However the instructions are also very poor in my opinion. The brackets are not like the drawing and some care needs to be taken not to drill in the wrong place. No instruction is given regarding the hole spacing eg width of blind - 'x'mm. Overall this is a minor grumble and I would recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:33:53.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

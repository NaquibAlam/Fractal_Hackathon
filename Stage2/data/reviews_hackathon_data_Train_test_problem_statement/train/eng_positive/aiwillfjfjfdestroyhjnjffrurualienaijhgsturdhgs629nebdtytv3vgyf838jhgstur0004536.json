There's many dresses to choose from. Most of the prices are very reasonable. If you are last minute prom dress shopping, this website is a good one to look at. I ordered my dress on February 08 and recieved my dress on February 13. The dress shipped from New Jersey and i live in Alabama. The dress fit perfectly also! So excited for prom now.

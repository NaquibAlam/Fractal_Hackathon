This is my first time to order from Yesstyle. This website has a lot of categories to choose from. And everything looks good!! They provide free shipping for a total order of USD150 (I reside in Qatar) which is not bad. And I find their website easy to navigate.\nImportant tips:\n1) Pay attention to the EDT of each item. Please note that they ship all items one time so make sure that all items you select has a delivery time of 3-5 days or 7-14 days, longer if you can wait.\n2) Read the customer reviews. The previous customers will give you an idea of what size to choose, the make and fabric of the item which in turn, helps you decide whether to select the item or not.\nI just ordered today and ETD of my items will be on 1st Feb 2017. I can't wait to receive my items. I hope Yesstyle won't disappoint. I will give another rating for my purchases once I have them!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:20:56.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

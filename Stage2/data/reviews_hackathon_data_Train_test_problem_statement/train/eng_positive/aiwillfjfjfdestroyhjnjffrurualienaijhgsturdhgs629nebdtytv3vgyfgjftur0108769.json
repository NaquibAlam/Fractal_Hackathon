The trees were exactly as described and delivered on time. The trees had very large caliper trunks and healthy root systems. Willis Orchards provide exact shipping & delivery information so that I was able to have the planting sites prepared the day before the arrival of the trees. The trees are all doing very well in Virginia. I have purchased several trees from other vendors for over 20 years and Willis Orchards clearly provides the best quality and value that I have ever seen. I am already planning my next purchase from Willis Orchards for the next season. Willis Orchards is definitely 10 STARS!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T23:14:12.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was trying to book an international flight online for my son and I to New Zealand that did not go through and I was contacted by phone immediately by the best travel agent ever (Sienna Miles) to help me complete the transaction! Though we were disconnected 3-4 times during the process (my poor cell service I believe), she always called me back right away and assisted with my special request (1 RT and 1 one way ticket) along with the shortest flight and best price available! If I were not planning to retire next year, I would likely try to recruit Sienna as my personal assistant...she was unbelievable!!! Thanks Sienna!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T07:22:12.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

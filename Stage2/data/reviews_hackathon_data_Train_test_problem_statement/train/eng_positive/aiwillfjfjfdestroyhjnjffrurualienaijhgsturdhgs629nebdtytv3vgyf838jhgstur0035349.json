It arrived very well packed, and from placing my order to its arrival took only 5days. I live in Inverness Scotland and there was no charge for the postage.The model I have purchased is the Veloped Tour 12er LargeVersion. I also bought a Multi Function Pump and a two piece holder for my walking stick.\nI have to say Iam extremely pleased with my Veloped. It is very easy to move and steer both in the town and the country. The adjustable two front wheels are ideal for dealing with rough and smooth surfaces, and are easy to change from one position to the other. The braking system is first class,and when I wish to watch my favourite rugby team in action ,the seating arrangement is very comfortable an simple to use..\nOn the rugby pitch in muddy conditions the the two front wheel mechanism is a godsend. When in town it is easy to fold the V\neloped so as to be able to get through narrow door openings and into lifts.\nI am disabled in having severe Spondylosis of the neck and lower spine, I also have a titanium hipjoint as the result of a bad fall, and I find the Veloped a great help in allowing me to walk more easily and also further, than I could with rollaters I have had in the past. The pneumatic tyres also make pushing over kerbs and similar objects no problem.\nIhave a relatively small car (Hyundai ix20) and the Veloped fits into the back with the back seats lowered, and as the wheels are easily removed it fits in the boot , no problem--without the lowering of the back seat.\nI like my Veloped !!,and look forward to many happy miles ahead.\nIf there are any future points I think that might be of interest I shall let you know. The sun is now out so Iam off with my trusty Veloped.!!\nYours Aye\nKenneth S B Henderson", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T14:56:54.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

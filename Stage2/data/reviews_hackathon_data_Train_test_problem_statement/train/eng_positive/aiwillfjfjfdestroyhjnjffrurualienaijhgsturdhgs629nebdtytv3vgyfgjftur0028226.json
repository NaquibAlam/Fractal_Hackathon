Today I needed to get some help with a billing issue and some tech support and right away my call was answered by a very friendly support tech named Tim Barger. He was dynamic and very happy to help. He also answered some other questions about my website maintenance that I had. I am very satisfied with the help I received today.\nI am writing this review because very often when searching for a service such as a hosting provider, we search for and read reviews, but only end up on the negative ones. Often, happy clients don't write reviews because we are too busy being happy. That being said, I decided to put in a good word for an excellent company that has always offered excellent products and service for its customers.\nIf you are looking for a web hosting and site building provider, you will be happy with WebStarts. I certainly am.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T18:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:39:02.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

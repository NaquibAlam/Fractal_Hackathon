I ordered three trees that came well packaged. They had excellent root structure and were a bit larger than the specified size. I potted them immediately upon receipt and two weeks later they are breaking dormancy, probably helped by the extremely warm weather on the Texas Gulf Coast this year. The only reason that I did not give this review five stars was that I ordered before Christmas as a gift for my son and the indication was that they would arrive by Christmas. They didn't arrive for another two weeks. In my case it didn't matter that much and I would much rather that the trees were packaged and shipped at the optimal time for transplanting. Will aim to update this review as we see how these trees do this spring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:07:44.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

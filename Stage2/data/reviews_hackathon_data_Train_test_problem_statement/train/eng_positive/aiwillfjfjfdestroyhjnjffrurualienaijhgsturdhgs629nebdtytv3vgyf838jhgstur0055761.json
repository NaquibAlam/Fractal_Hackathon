Being responsible for someoneâ€™s property and most importantly beloved pets is not only an unforgettable experience, it is also a chance to see yourself in a different environment. It is a perfect way for those who are passionate about animals and travel to combine those two. You get to meet some amazing people who put their trust in you and, in a way, invited you not only to look after their property and pet, but to become a part of their family for a while, which is priceless!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:47:52.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

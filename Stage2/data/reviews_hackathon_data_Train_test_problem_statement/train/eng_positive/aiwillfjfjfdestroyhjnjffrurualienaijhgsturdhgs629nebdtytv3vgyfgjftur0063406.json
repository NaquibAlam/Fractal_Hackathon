The simplistic designs are wonderful and elegant.\nI ordered about 150 invitations for my wedding, and they arrived exactly two days later! The quality is amazing, and the layout is exactly how I designed it.\nThe only improvement could be in the designing interface, it was difficult to centre the various text fields, and there was no way to zoom in either.\nBesides that, I am so glad I went with this website, and got a great discount too. Will definitely be using Optimalprint again :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:56:38.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They are quick to let me know if there are any kind of problem with the cater I picked and they help recommend another if the one I picked has an issue. The only con I have is some of the locations I need only have limited breakfast choices and I hate when I pick a breakfast place and they don't offer coffee! If I'm feeding a group for breakfast they want coffee. I also usually spend right around $100 for each meal. Hate there are some I would use but minimum is $200+. Otherwise I have been very happy using Ezcater.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:46:42.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

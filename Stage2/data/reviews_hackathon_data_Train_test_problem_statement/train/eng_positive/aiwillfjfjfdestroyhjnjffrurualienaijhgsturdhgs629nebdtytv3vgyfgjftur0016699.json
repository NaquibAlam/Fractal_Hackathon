The Property and our Unit is clean and just the right size. I am very happy.\nHowever, upon check-in I was expecting the $1 first month deal and was told because my husband had had a unit at another property, I was not eligible. I just wish I had been aware of this before move-in. I still do not understand why I was not eligible, it is not a deal we have gotten before.\nAND, why would a company not want to extend great deals to loyal customers? I would love an explanation or better yet the deal!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T22:55:53.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

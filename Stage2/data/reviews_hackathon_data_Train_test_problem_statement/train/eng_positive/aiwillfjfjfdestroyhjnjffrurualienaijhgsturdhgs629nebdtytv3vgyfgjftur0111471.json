Both outfits arrived after 3 days, beautifully packaged and with a personal touch.The quality of my pieces is breathtaking compared to clothing here. I have decided to keep both outfits and stun the congregation!!! A big thank you to all concerned.\nWould thoroughly recommend the service and quality from Mcelhinneys", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:30:30.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

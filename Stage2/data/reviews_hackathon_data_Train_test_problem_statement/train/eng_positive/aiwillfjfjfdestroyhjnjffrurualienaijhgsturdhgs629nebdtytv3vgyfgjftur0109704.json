The water is pretty hard and has some odors. The new system has completely removed all odors, and the water tastes absolutely great. The installation was simple and instructions were straight forward. If you are not familiar with the installation of PVC piping systems I would recommend using a plumber to set it up for you because it does require quite a few fittings. The only issue I noted is that I personally would prefer all the filter and other components be female fittings made of brass or stainless steel rather than the plastic male ends provided because threading female adapters onto the supplied male fittings pose a potential fitting failure from cracking. This is just one weakness that I resolved by installing threaded brass couplings at all connection points. This allows to use male adaptors at the connection points and greatly reduces fitting failures from overtightening. Other than that this is a great product and would recommend this product to anyone who asked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:13:36.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was my 30 year anniversary and the only thing I wanted for my anniversary was a larger diamond to replace the one in my current set. Erin Winchell guided me through the process and helped me pick out the best diamond for our budget. I chose to send my set into Brilliance to have them set my new diamond and I was so happy with the results! My set of 30 years looked like a brand new set after the new diamond was put in and the rings were cleaned and polished. I highly recommend using Brilliance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:24:45.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

He answered every question I had completely. And he continued to keep in touch throughout the entire process to make sure things were going well. I've already given his name/contact information to a couple of friends with glowing references! My husband had chosen a plan after many hours of research on his own and Wayne spoke with him about some \"hidden\" issues with that plan and my husband changed his plan. We are moving to PA and Wayne covered everything we needed to know. Totally happy with our experiences with Go-Medigap!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:36:15.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

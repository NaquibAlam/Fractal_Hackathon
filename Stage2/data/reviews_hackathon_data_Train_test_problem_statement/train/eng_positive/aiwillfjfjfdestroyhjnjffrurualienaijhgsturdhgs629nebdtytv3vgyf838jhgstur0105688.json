Currently, one must open each bundle separately, one at a time, to determine the composition and price of each bundle. To me, this is very off-putting and discourages me from even checking out their bundles. At the very least, and in the interest of not wasting their customers' time and resources, Bundle Stars should display a list of each bundle's contents on the main 'Bundles' page.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T13:15:34.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

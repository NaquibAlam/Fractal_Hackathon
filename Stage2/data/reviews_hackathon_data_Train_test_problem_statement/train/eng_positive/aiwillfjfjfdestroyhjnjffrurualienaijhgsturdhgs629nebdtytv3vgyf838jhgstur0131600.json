The real test of quality of service is when the underlying job is difficult. We made Steve's job difficult by choosing to buy a problem property with a complicated history! The good news is that the story has a happy ending thanks to Steve.\nFirst off, Steve is a really nice guy and easy to deal with. He answers all of your questions quickly and efficiently. He knows the area inside out, and as a novice to buying in Spain, he got me up to speed very quickly on the areas, the system and the culture. This inside knowledge is invaluable, and if you are new to buying in Spain then you really need a Steve to guide you. No amount of google searches will give you the quality of advice that Steve can give.\nOur transaction took about 10 months to complete, in-spite of us deciding to buy pretty much the first house that Steve showed us on the first day we met him. The difficulties related to the title to the house and a bank not releasing security. As I say, not simple, and that is where you really need the help of someone like Steve. We tried various ways of solving the problem, and we also started looking again, and in the end we got pretty much what we started out looking for on the same community, so it was a happy ending. Ten months from making an offer to closing is a long time, even in Spain, and in that time Steve maintained good contact, chased down the vendor and turned up on the closing to bring it over the line. Along the way Steve can help you with things like bank accounts and lawyers, and will even help you with lots of the nitty gritty practical issues involved in setting up a new home.\nIf you are thinking of buying in and around Marbella, why would you not want Steve to help you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:31:27.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Each of these transactions required a call requested by AFG to inform my bank of the incoming transaction in foreign currency. I probably spent one and a half hours on the phone over four calls to the bank - this is not a rewarding experience.\nI have used online resources frequently in the past to purchase travel services and hopefully will again in the future. What I am used to is a single transaction between myself and the travel agency for all of the charges that I have incurred- simple.\nIn summary, thank you Cris for the work that you put in but I will be booking more flights with AFG when the current business model is consigned to the bin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:22:57.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

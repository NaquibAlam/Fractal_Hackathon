It seems very unprofessional and unsafe to me, even though it worked for me and my friends that also bought some games on this site. I also got a mini-heart attack, when I entered my pin codes for 40€ worth of paysafecard, payed for it and the \"you have to be logged in\" menu popped up, so I singed up, and when I tried again, the money wasn't on the paysafecards anymore, nor was my payment in transactions. After few minutes it showed up as a complete payment, but it really scared the bloody hell out of me. BUT I'M NOT SAYING THOSE ARE CRUCIAL PROBLEMS. Everything works really good, and the prices are sometimes jaw-dropping, but as I stated above, there are some mostly cosmetic unnecessities, that can be very uncomfortable for costumer. Anyway, it's great site and I would personally recommend it even over G2A. I rate it 4.5*/5*.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T04:10:26.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

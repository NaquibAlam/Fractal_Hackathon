Flashbay was everything I was looking for !\nI couldn't believe all of the choices of what kind of USB you could get when I first saw their website. I ordered 25 twister USBs with my logo and they look so amazing ! The quality of them is fabulous!! My logo is gold and black and it turned out exactly how I wanted.\nThe rep Sabrina was fantastic to work with the whole time. She was very quick to get back to me and very thorough when answering my million questions.\nI will be recommending Flashbay to everyone and be coming back for more in the future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T09:58:09.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

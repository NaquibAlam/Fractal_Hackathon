I've been to them before for tires. My car needed inspection and an oil change. I had been going to my dealer but it's a haul to get there and takes forever! I was going to go up Rt. 9 (they're great, too) but spotted Mavis in Hopewell Jct. Went right in and made an appointment. They were very accommodating. Got there at 8 and was out the door 45 minutes later. Prices were competitive and they didn't try to pressure me into a lot of other things. This will be my go to place for auto maintenance!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:51:00.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

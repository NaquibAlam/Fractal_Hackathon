We do not like to put our cat in a cattery and know that he is much happier and contented in his own surroundings. We were searching the internet for a solution and found THS by chance. And what a find! We have had three wonderful reliable sitters (and a very happy cat) to date during 2016 and already have other sitters lined up for 2017. I have also carried out two sits which have been extremely rewarding experiences. It gives you a super experience to live elsewhere and take care of other people's pets knowing how precious they are to them. We would certainly recommend THS to anybody", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:48:19.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It work great on my Tenn well water. My new system is the whole house cartridge system over here on the coast of North Carolina. House came with an iron filter so I added the sediment, carbon, and salt-free softener system . Great tasting clear water, no iron taste or smell , softner greatly reduced spots on dishes. Pelican has great prices and customer service is outstanding. Highly recommend !!

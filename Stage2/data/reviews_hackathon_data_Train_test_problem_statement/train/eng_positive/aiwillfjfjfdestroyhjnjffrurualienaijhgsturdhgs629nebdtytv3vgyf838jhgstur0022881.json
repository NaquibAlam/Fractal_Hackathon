The coordination with Artwork, and Production of the Product was excellent as well.\nI highly recommend Disk Makers to Independent Musicians and Record Labels that do not have access to Million Dollar Facilities and Budgets that match.\nGreat Job Disk Makers..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T01:59:20.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

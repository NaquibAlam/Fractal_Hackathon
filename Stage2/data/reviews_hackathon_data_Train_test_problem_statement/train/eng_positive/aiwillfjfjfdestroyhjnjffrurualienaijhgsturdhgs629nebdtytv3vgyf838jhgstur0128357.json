I have earned over $258 in rebates. I do look at other cashback sites to see which one I can get the most money from. This site has been rewarding for me. I give it 4 stars because compared to the other sites, it takes tooo long to get the rebate. I think if some of the other sites can get the cashback in less time, maybe Topcashback can look at how they do their cashback policies as well. It takes wayy too long. That is my only issue. Sometimes I use my rebates towards my Amazon.com which you can get a little more if you do or I may use my paypal. There are plenty of other ways to get your money as well, but Amazon is my preferred since I order there alot.\nTHanks for taking the time to read my review,\nBrandi", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T08:22:14.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Having said that, we got the finished article within 3 days all the way from the US so I guess that explains the delivery charge. My daughter is delighted with the finished article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T12:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:33:57.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

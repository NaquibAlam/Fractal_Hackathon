Cannot fault their professionalism from the moment they answer the phone. Danny who has been our contact at DialAFlight is really great helping with our flights to the USA. We have a return flight but from a different state to the state we arrive in. Gets the best deal too on car hire. Great to have that 'personal' contact from start to finish. Nothing ever seems too much trouble. Would definitely recommend DialAFlight to anyone. They deliver every time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T10:38:26.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

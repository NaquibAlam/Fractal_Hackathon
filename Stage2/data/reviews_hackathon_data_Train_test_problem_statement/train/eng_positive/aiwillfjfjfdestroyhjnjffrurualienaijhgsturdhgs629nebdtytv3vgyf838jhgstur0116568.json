From placing my order, to shipment, to delivery... I have never had a single problem with any transactions I've done with Ssense. I've seen reviews outlining issues ordering/returning stuff in the past for people who live in the U.S. but I have never experienced anything to complain about, and they have always lived up to their expectations even with orders I've placed during the holiday months. I'd recommend Ssense to any and everyone looking to snag geniuine, authentic, designer wear for the best prices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:49:39.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

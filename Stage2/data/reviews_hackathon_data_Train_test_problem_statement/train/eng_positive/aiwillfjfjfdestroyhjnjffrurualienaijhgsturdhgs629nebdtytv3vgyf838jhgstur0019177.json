Booking the tour was so easy and our tour guide Eli was the best. But like Eli said, \"we must thank all those men and women who gave their lives for us to be able to visit Israel in the first place\". I thank them every day because my life has changed entirely. I also want to thank Eli for taking us off the beaten path at times to take us to his favorite little places to shop and eat. His sense of humor and his smile will brighten your day!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:20:34.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

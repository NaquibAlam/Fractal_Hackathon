Not for everyone, but a thrill for the person that isnt ready to climp Mt Everest, but still has adventure in their blood.\nArenal was lovely - the hot springs at Arenal Springs and resort were heavenly - regardless of the torrential rain! Never saw the volcano - visitors rarely see the volcano - thoroughly enjoyed our stay regardless - Zip lining in the rain was awesome !\nParador was the highlight. Spectacular terraced pools overlooking the Pacific, wildlife everywhere, comfortable room, good food, Manuel Antonio beach is one of the nicest beaches I have ever been to - if I could only go to one location, it would be to the Parador resort - over the top in every way!\nBring plenty on singles and $5 bills - spent approx $250 in tips. The staff, drivers & tour guides expect it, and deserves it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:25:13.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

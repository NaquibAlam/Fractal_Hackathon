On this occasion we hired a Toyota Corolla from Auckland City and dropped it off a couple of weeks later in Wellington. In both places staff were cheerful and helpful. In Wellington we were offered a lift to the Rail Station. The car was just what we needed, was clean when we collected it and behaved well throughout.\nIn both our dealings with Omega we have opted for small cars and have found them to be excellent value for money. Provided you don't need the latest model, we can strongly recommend Omega Rentals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T21:41:39.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

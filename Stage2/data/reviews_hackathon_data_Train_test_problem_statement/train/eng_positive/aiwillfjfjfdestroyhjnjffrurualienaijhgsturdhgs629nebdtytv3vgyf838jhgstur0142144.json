The watch (despite its age) is immaculate.\nI part exchanged an old watch and was given a slightly below market value. I felt this was fair given that the guys would have to service it and bring it up to standard in order to sell. I also made them an offer which was met half way. Again, I felt this was fair.\nOverall, I left with the impression that Mark Worthington jewellers are extremely proud of their high standards and will only sell items which have been presented to a high standard. They are also very knowledgeable about their business.\nAfter a few days I noticed a slight metallic rattle. I called the guys who promptly suggested to send it back to be looked at by their work shop. I was relieved that they were keen to ensure I was happy with my purchase rather than just a sale.\nI would recommend these guys if you are in the market for a used watch. Their prices are fair for the quality of the stock they sell. The sale was a friendly but highly professional experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:17:53.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

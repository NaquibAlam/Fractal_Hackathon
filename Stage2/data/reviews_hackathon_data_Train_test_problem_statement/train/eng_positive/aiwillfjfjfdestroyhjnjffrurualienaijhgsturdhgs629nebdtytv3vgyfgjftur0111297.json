They arrived on time and ready to work. They were all good guys and very hard workers.\nThey completed the job in less than expected time and with only a few minor issues. When tying the sump drain pipe into my drainage pipe they broke the pipe. They immediately told me and didn't try to hide or deny it. I took pictures and sent it to the office. They put it in my file and said they would take care of it if there were any issues.\nA few days after the job was completed in noticed a few holes for the vented drain plugs had not been drilled. They quickly sent someone to complete the drilling.\nThe biggest issue was they didn't cover all the belongings they had me move to the center of the cellar with plastic as the salesman told me they would. Instead they made a half moon plastic wall around the stuff. Needless to say I spent a lot of time the next few weekends cleaning the belongings.\nAs far as the waterproofing everything is working well. Over the past two months we have had a considerable amount of rain and melted snow. I have not seen any water. I am looking forward to the spring and summer downpours to really test it! If the system continues to work it will provide us a considerable amount of piece of mind. From what I have seen so far I think we are going to be extremely happy!\nWith the exception of the belongings not being covered we were extremely happy with the job. Our salesman wasn't pushy, the office people were very good from the scheduling and warranty follow up and the crew worked extremely hard. Overall I would give the experience a 95 out of 100 so far.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:05:02.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

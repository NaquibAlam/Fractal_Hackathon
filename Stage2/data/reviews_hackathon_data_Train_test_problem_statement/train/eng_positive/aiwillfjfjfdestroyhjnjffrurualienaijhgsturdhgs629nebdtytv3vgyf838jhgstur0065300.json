I've had them balanced twice (elsewhere) and still had a shake in the car. I called Yokohama who referenced me to Town Fair - New London CT since I bought them online.\nTony examined the tires and when nothing was found on visual inspection agreed to check them for being out of round for me. My original plans was to identify a bad tire and return it. Somehow. What a pain. Turns out they were out of balance about 2oz. Keep in mind these tires have less than 500mi on them.\nThis act will make us Town Fair customers from now on. I'm am DONE buying tires online. Like Tony said to me \"You can't buy expertise.\" Well he is right and so is the skill that Ralph showed taking care of the issue in under 10 minutes. Thanks again to everyone who helped me out. This is an example of how to treat customers and generate return business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T08:54:35.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

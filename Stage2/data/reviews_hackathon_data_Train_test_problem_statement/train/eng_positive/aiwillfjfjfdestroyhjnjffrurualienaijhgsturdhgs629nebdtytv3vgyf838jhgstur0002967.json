After touching down in Sydney at a humid and discusting 38Â°+ We were greated by our car rental airport transfer Van. Apex Car Rental.\nNot only did they refuse to provide car seat for this airport transfer for my child, They expected me to drive around Sydney with a car seat that did not reach the standards of Australia child restraint Laws. After a 4 hour dispute I finally received my money back and ventured to Redspot... Although very very extremely over priced and expensive ( Apex were $600 more cheaper ) i had to think of the safety of my child.\nThe Staff at Sydney airport Redspot were Fantastic. 1 staff member in perticular ( i cant remember his name) had a car and proper complete child restraint ready for me in less than 15 minutes. He was so kind, and very happy to help.\nI was there on the 24/01/2017 around 4pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:24:17.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

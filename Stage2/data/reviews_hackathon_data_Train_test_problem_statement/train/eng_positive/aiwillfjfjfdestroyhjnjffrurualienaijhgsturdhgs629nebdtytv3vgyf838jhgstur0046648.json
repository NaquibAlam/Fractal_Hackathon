Fred sold us the spa the service was great. The spa was delivered and installed with no problems at all. We had a few questions about the spa controls since delivery and they have been extremely helpful every time. Lillian has been very helpful with some good tips for keeping the spa clean. I would recomend Spa World Gregory Hills to anyone as the service is great.

We were strangers to one another a week earlier.\nI’m soaking it all in and it’s overwhelming. My body begins to gently convulse with emotion, the tears start to flow. The woman to my left pats my back to comfort me.\nIt’s been a physical, mental and emotional roller coaster.\nThis is boot camp.\nA week in warm, scenic Portugal, taking part in around 6 hours of exercise a day in a programme devised by experienced ex-Navy physical training instructor, Staff R and his team. They’re bloody good at what they do.\nIt’s not just about training the body. It’s also about immersing yourself in a glow of positivity; a rare chance to focus entirely on yourself for a whole week, reset your goals, or create new ones, eat well, sleep well, think about what’s meaningful to you, what you have achieved and what you can achieve in the future.\nIt’s laid out from the get-go that you get out of boot camp what you put in. It’s up to you to make the most of the opportunity. However, there’s a high rate of returners at Prestige. This makes sense; that level of positivity is addictive, making you want to return for a top-up.\nYou exercise pretty much all parts of your body during the week, and you bond with some amazing people while doing it. Everyone has their own story to tell about why they’re at boot camp. I’ve been humbled by the experiences that some of my fellow boot campers have shared with me. They put my own worries into perspective.\nNotwithstanding their problems, every boot camper contributed to a supremely supportive environment, perpetuated by Staffs R, W and F.\nYou start to believe you can do anything. I feel as though I’ve had a reset and been pointed in the right direction.\nMy biggest physical challenge was a long walk to the next town, which involved a steep climb up a large hill. I’d done this kind of thing many times before, but I was wildly out of shape in comparison with those days.\nI wanted to complete it but I struggled mentally and physically all the way. Staff W was there behind me as I stumbled towards the top, being overtaken by more and more of my party. I hated that it was a struggle and that I was full of fear and worry about injuring myself; that ghost of a two-year-old ankle break still haunting my life. I was stumbling and gasping for air.\nPatient and ever-encouraging Staff W told me to take five paces then rest. He talked me through the rest of the ascent... just a little more...take the right hand path...10 more steps and you’re there...he never gave up on me.\nThank you, Staff W. It meant a lot to me.\nPrestige Boot Camp will change your life; the esprit de corps, the boost in self-confidence, the miraculous transformation in just one week, the beautiful sunrise on the beach. You’ll be amazed what you can achieve in a short space of time.\nI rediscovered the person I used to be and I’m very grateful.\nThanks guys! x", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T15:39:18.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was immediately contacted by a customer service representative who communicated back and forth with me about whether I should order single vision lenses or progressive lenses. I finally decided to go with progressive lenses. When I received my glasses, I immediately noticed that they were single vision lenses. When I contacted the same customer service representative, she told me that I was obviously mistaken since the paperwork for my order that she was looking at said \"progressive.\" She suggested I go back to my eye doctor for another exam, since the \"progressive\" lenses prescribed to me weren't adequate. I explained I had just had an eye exam only the day before ordering these glasses, and I asked that I be authorized to return them so she could see for herself that they did not have progressive lenses. It took a couple days for someone to get back to me, but when I did hear back (from another customer service representative), I was told that they would send a return label to me via email. I used the label to return the glasses. I then heard from yet a third representative that the lenses were indeed single vision as I had told them. However, they said it would take 10-14 business days to make my new lenses. I told them that my order should be rushed and, thankfully, they did rush my order through and overnighted the glasses to me. Now that I have the correct progressive lenses in my frame I do like my glasses. However, it took way too long to get to this point. I will not order from FramesDirect.com again.\nUPDATE: I received an email and voicemail from Jennifer at FramesDirect. She apologized for their delay in providing a return label for the glasses that had been shipped with single vision lenses, that were supposed to be shipped with progressive lenses. She explained that they usually provide a much faster return service, and offered a $50.00 refund to my credit card as an apology. This exemplary level of customer service has changed my mind about purchasing from Frames Direct in the future. I will consider buying from them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T20:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:21:30.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

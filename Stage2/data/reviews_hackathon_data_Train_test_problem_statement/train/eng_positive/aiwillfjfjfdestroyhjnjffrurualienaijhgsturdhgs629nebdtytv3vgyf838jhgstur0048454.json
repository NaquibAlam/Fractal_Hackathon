I have never had a reliability problem.\nThe queue at the desk can be a little long sometimes but that is because most people arriving on the same flight, as me had made a reservation with Goldcar rather than the other rental companies available.\nHowever, I have recently tried the Key 'n' Go service, which is mega fast and you can be on your way within minutes of collecting your bags from the carousel.\nA special mention should go to Eva Maria and Javier, who have both gone out of their way to assist me on several occasions. Having said this, all the staff at the Murcia Airport office have been extremely friendly and helpful at all times. Many thanks to you all.\nI would recommend Goldcar without hesitation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T15:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:56:27.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

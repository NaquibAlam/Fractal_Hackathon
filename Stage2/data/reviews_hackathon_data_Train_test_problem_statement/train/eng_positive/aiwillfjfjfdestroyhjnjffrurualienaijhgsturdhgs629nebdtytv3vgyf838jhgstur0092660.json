In this day and age when customer care is greatly lacking, Fireside is bucking the trend. I goofed up on my order and Bill (in sales) caught it and informed me of what I really needed. Once we got that straightened out, I had my order in 3 days. I couldn't be happier. Keep up the great work and I will recommend Fireside anytime anyone asks me where to go for chimney supplies. Their prices are very competitive also. 5 STARS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T07:00:45.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

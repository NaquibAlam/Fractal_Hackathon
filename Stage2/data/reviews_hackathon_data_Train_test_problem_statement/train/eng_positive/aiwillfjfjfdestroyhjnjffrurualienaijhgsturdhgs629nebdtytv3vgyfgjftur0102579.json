It took a few months before I got my first sale, but since then they have been coming in more frequently.\nThe positives with eBid first and foremost are the fees. At 0-3%, they are so low that I could price an item for less than it sells for on the major eCommerce sites and still make more money than I would have if I listed it on the big sites. I also find it very easy and straightforward to use. I rarely have problems when listing something. The Seller+ subscription is also great. Instead of paying $20+ a month on the other site with no guarantee you'll make that money back, for $50 when you sign up you have up to five stores for life with no monthly charge. It did take some time before I made my $50 back, but now it has more than paid for itself. Another plus with eBid is you don't have any monthly selling limits or restrictions that keep your growth limited. I also feel that eBid is a much friendlier and supportive site. The eBid forums have been immensely helpful with questions and problems from other sellers who want to help make eBid a better place to buy and sell.\nNow for the negatives. The obvious one and the only real complaint I have is that since it is not a big site or well known like the other big sites, traffic is far less and it is harder to get sales. I have found that advertising on social media sites helps bring some traffic to listings. The most important thing to do is make sure listings are Google compliant for uploading to Google Shopping. Unless eBid gets a major publicity boost from something like a TV commercial, I can't expect for my items to be flying off the shelves every day on eBid.\nSo there you have it. It will take time to build up sales and eBid requires a different learning curve not needed with the other sites, but it is far from \"a waste of time\" or is a site with \"no sales\" as I have seen many other reviewers say. eBid truly has the potential to grow into a great site that can really compete with the big sites and give them a run for their money, but unless they do some serious advertising (like on TV), it will be slow, but steady growth for eBid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T10:19:47.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

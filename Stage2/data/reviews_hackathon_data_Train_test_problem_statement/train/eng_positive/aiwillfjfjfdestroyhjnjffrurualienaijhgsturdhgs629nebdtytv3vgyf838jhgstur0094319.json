I have offered for a number of tasks and have been assigned 4 already, even as a very very newbie. I am already recommending Airtasker to my friends and family - it just offers up so many options to work the way I want to and to be able to pick and choose what works best for me, my family and my lifestyle. The app is great and easy to use as well. Thank you Airtasker, I'm so happy I found you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T02:36:01.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

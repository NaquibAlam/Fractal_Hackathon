I love the fact that someone I am familiar with is advertised on here. I love that long sleeve style shirts are available in all seasons. I love that classic styles are available along side new and modern prints and styles. I love that the VIP membership has an option to opt out of a month for as many months as you want. The website felt kind of cluttered to me. I love having a variety to choose from but it wasn't very easy for me to navigate the sections I was interested in and scroll through the pages. I think making the picture boxes bigger and making the side bar smaller would make it easier. If the items I purchased are good quality and fit well I will definitely be back! The prices, with a VIP membership, were decent. Very pleased so far!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:26:26.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

She was bright, friendly and she kept us updated throughout the entire process. It was such lift after the three knuckleheads I got when I searched Reverse Mortgages on Lending Tree. Each rep from the 3 lenders Lending Tree referred was not at all helpful. They fired off the qualifying questions in a routine manner, then said they would contact me if they could help us. Mari was they exact opposite. She was interested in what we were trying to accomplish, and took an active part in suggesting the best ways to accomplish our goal. We cannot tell you how pleasant dealing with her was. I would certainly urge anyone who is searching for a reverse mortgage to use AAG, and especially Maricella! So glad I saw the Tom Select ad on TV the night that the other three lenders said they couldn't help us!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T05:46:10.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

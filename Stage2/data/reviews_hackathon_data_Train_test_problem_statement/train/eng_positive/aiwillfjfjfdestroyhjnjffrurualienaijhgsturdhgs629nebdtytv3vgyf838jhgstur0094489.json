He asked the most pertinent questions and then found me what I wanted getting me a better price option than I could have ever found. I will go to him any time I need help planning a trip whether it's in the USA or abroad.\nUPDATE-I'm not sure what happened to Enrique but he hasn't returned my calls or answered my emails and I was ready to book 3 more tickets. I booked them online instead. I most likely was the cause of this disconnect because I was having back and forth dates and times for this flight so he probably just dropped me...like a rock... so he could carry on with his other customers. AND in case that wasn't the issue and he's just disappeared I hope he calls me back because I liked having less expensive flights and having him hold the tickets till I was ready to pay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:58:48.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Plus you can print as many invitations as you want, to mail to family or friends who don't use email, or to keep as a memento.\nThe company is helpful and friendly and there aren't millions of emails trying to upsell you, etc...Just updates on your rsvp list. I love that guests will receive reminders, links to directions, information on the wedding, and our registry. The registry site they work with allows you to add items from any retailer, start a honeymoon fund or home improvement fund or a charity of your choice. It's made things 100 % easier.\nEveryone has complimented us on the invite design. We highly recommend Greenvelope!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:20:01.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

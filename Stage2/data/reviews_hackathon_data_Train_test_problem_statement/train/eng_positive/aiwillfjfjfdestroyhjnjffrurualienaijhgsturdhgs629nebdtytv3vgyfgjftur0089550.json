So far I've got two shipments. In the future there will be more.\nWe love our new sheepskin slippers, and my cats fight for the pet rug they've got! I ordered the least expensive slippers, and my son and I are very happy with them. We both like to have a little room on the inside when wearing slippers, and ordered slightly bigger sizes. Perfect. I recommend Kiwi products to anyone who lives in cooler climates.\nThe delivery is super fast too.\nThanks again, Kiwi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:38:24.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

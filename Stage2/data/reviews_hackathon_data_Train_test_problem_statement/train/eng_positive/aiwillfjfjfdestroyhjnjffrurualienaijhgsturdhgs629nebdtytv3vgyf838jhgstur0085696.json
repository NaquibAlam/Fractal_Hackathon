Well an \"SMU\" is a Special Makeup Unit that is not sold on the general market. \"Factory Seconds\" or \"Blems\" is an other way of putting it. These are products that the manufacturer through quality control did not pass standards and were pulled. I noticed the \"SMU\" label on the product description when I received my Denali snowshoes. This was not in the description of the product on the website. But all in all I thoroughly inspected the snowshoes and see no noticeable problems or \"Blemishes\".\nBindings, traction bars, and the deck are similar to each other and have no noticeable differences or issues. www. wildernessx. com sells them cheaper for $99.95. Just a heads up on that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T23:03:43.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

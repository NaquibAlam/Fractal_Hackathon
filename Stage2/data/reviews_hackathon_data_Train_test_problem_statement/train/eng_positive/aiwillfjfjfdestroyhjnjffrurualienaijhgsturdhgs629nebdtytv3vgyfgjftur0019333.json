I originally was going for the engraved plastic name tag, but found out after I placed the order it couldn't be fulfilled. Very disappointing. I settled on a plastic digital printed one which turned out pretty well. The crispness of the logo isn't there. You can see some of the ink spread. Edges of the name tag are crinkled when you look at the tag a certain way. All in all though the company response and timeliness was great! quality is pretty good. I would use them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T23:32:48.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They'll make you want to kick web travel services to the curb and long for the days of true service and SkyLux delivers! We priced international business class tickets to Europe through Google Travel and the price was just under $15k. We had questions about trying to swap flights, but Google, Kyak, Travelocity, etc. offered no way to do it. We saw the icon for SkyLux and clicked on it because it showed you could talk to someone live. We told the SkyLux agent which flights we wanted and the class desired on each flight. Within 15 minutes we received a call back and the price was HALF that of Google and the other web travel services! We took our $7k savings and upgraded our hotels! Super simple, super quick, EVERY question answered! CALL THEM, they are WONDERFUL!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T20:00:16.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

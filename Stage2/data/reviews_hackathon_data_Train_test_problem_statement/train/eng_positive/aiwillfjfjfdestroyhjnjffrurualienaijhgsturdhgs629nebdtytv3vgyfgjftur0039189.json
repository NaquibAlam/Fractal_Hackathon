However this time it was not as frozen as it always has been. Yes it had the ice but other than cold it was not\nfrozen.and if I was not home to receive it I think all would be thawed completely.\nI also feel like when you sent me my conformation you could put what was ordered as you always did before. I don't have Adobe and no matter how hard I tried to install it I couldn't. Why can't you just sent it with the email like always? I order from other places and they all put it in my email.

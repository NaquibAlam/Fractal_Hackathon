My JRT is eating happily for the first time in ages, and my Cocker is shiny, healthy and above all has had absolutely NO problems with her anal glands since starting her new diet. (Previously they needed emptied once a month)\nNot only is it value for money, but the staff are incredibly helpful and quick to respond to any queries. And the most important thing of all, my dogs are the healthiest and happiest they've been for a long time! So so chuffed I found this fantastic company ❤️❤️", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:23:24.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

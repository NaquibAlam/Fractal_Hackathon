Leaving, frustrated we decided to go to Gardner White in Canton and we were greeted by a nice gentleman (Blaine) who explained everything to my wife and I regarding the deals going on that weekend and he didn't pressure us either! Immediately we noticed better craftsmanship and quality in the furniture and fell in love with a beautiful living room set for a great price. After we decided to purchase it we talked to the salesman we met at the door and discussed delivery, he told us he could have it delivered the following week but because both my wife and I work late he set it up for delivery the next day on Sunday. I would recommend Gardner White to all my friends and family!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:13:34.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

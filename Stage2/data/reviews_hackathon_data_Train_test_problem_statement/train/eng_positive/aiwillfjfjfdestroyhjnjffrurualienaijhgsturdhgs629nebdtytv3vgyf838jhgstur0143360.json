In 2010 we had to move and rented our home while we were in living in another state for 6 years. We sold our home in 2016 and the buyers ask that we leave the water ionizer, So we decided to research water ionizers and purchase one for our new residence. We looked at many different companies, water ionizers and the reviews by other people as well as comparisons for various brands. We are excited to enjoy the health benefits or our Life Ionizer M9X. It has a lifetime warranty on parts and labor and the pH range is from 2.0 to 11.5. We especially appreciated that the company built the filters for our ionizer specific to the water in our community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:35:35.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

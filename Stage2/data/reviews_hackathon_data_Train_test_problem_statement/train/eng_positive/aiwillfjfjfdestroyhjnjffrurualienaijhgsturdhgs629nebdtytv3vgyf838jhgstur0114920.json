They are an authorized Steam dealer and at times sell their games much more cheaper than their competition. What makes them unique is their Bundles. These bundles have a theme such as; RPG, Strategy, Horror, Space, FPS, etc. Often times you can get a group of games for less than $5.99 USD. I've personally been a member of Bundle Stars for 4 years now and have found some amazing deals that not even Steam's Summer or Winter sale can compete price wise. Over those four years I've never experienced any difficulties in regards to purchasing or returning games I've purchased, and trust me I've bought a LOT of games from them, and you should too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:16:56.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It arrived within a couple day of shipment via Fedex. I was expecting a whip but to my surprise the tree had a nice shape with many branches and buds and minimal tip pruning. The caliper of the stock was a good 2 inches and the grafted Fuyu was at least 1 3/4 inches. There was a large cluster of nice size roots about the size of a pencil. Overall a fantastic tree.\nI will definitely shop Willis Ochard when shopping fruit trees in the future.\nI highly recommend Willis Ochard to anyone shopping trees on the internet.\nCanyon Lake TX", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:36:20.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The agency works on trust. The review system allows people seeking a sitter to see how satisfied others have been under various detailed headings. There is the opportunity to reply to reviews too. Our listing and profile are very detailed, enabling others to see whether we will suit their needs. We have had a very positive experience caring for pets, staying in homes rather than hotels and resorts and exploring new places. Pet owners can leave their animals in their own home rather than kennels. A wide range of animals can be catered for including farm animals (though not by us). Overall it works extremely well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:27:27.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

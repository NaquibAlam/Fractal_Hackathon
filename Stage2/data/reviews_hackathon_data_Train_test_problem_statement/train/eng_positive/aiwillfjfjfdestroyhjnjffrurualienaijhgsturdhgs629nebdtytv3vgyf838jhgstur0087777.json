Upon arriving I am blatantly ignored by what I only later discover to be the ONLY employee working at the Manassas, VA location, while I assume he is finishing up the previous appointment directly before mine.\nNearly 20 minutes pass (18 to be exact), in which I entered the \"office\" and upon discovering it devoid of any additional personnel with whom I could inquire about where I should park (the mere handful of allocated parking spaces were legitimately ALL taken over by construction equipment from the office next door), what I should do next - fill out paperwork, wait, etc... - or even check in with, I sit myself in the only available seat in what I am still unsure counts as an actual lobby, and begin to work on some schoolwork I had the foresight to bring along with me.\nTime goes by while the lone employee and the gentleman he is still assisting go in and out on a few separate occasions. It is only at this point I am finally approached by the gentleman employed by Smart Start, and he very briefly explains he will be unable to perform the installation today because he believes he does not have the necessary paperwork.\nI am not sure as to why he is unable to locate it, as I know with absolute certainty I filled it out and submitted it to the VASAP office the prior week. What I found even more frustrating are:\n1. I was not notified the paperwork required had apparently not been received when I made the initial appointment, or in the time leading up to the appointment when someone should have called to inform me so I did not end up wasting the better part of an afternoon.\n2. He actually had me sit in the lobby for almost 20 minutes (past my scheduled appointment mind you) waiting for him to get around to telling me all of this instead of at the very least, informing me as soon as I arrived.\nAfter the first appoint resulting in a \"misunderstanding\" (or what I considered to be a rather blatant disregard for customer service and ineptitude or refusal to thoroughly perform one's job), I actually called in twice, and the first time spoke with a customer service representative (whose name I am purposefully omitting), who I can honestly say he only goal seemed to finish the call as soon as possible...\nShe not only did not offer to make an appointment for me, but when I specifically requested assistance with doing so, she just gave me the nearest Smart Start location's phone number, and insisted I needed to contact them directly to schedule any appointments because she was supposedly unable to view their schedule openings on her end.\nIn her hurried rush to end the call, she even hung up on me before I was actually done needing her help.\nDiscouraged but opting to give Smart Start one more shot, I called customer service for the third time to finish my inquiry and possibly re-schedule an installation, I was thankfully finally connected with someone who clearly knew what they were doing, and was extremely pleasant to work with on top of it.\nChyann is quite frankly, the ONLY reason I ultimately decided to go with Smart Start instead of the myriad of other available providers in my area. She was exceptionally helpful, refreshingly friendly, and eager to help in any way she possibly could.\nAt the point I called the third time, I was about done with Smart Start given my repeated frustrations, and the overall incredible lack of even the most basic of customer service courtesies. Ms. Morey is virtually the sole basis for my final choice.\nWhile she easily receives more than five stars for her kindness and support, the Manassas location and the second representative I spoke with deserve no more than 2 (and even that is being overly generous).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T18:51:17.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

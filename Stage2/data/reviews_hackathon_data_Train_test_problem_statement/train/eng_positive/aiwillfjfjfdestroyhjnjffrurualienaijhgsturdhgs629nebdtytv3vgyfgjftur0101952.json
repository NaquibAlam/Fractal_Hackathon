With no option to get the money for my phone back and not wanting to wait 4 months to unlock though, I finally took the plunge and chose iphoneimei.net to unlock it. Boy am I happy I did!\nThe service by iphoneimei.net was truly first class. The minute I submitted my order I got a receipt back sending me a tracking number with a page showing a completion status all the way from 0-100%. I also got emails confirming when the order had been sent to the supplier, when there was supposedly a delay (even though it was within the stated timeframe) and also when my phone was completely unlocked.\nThe unlocking email also had an array of instructions for troubleshooting in case there were issues with the unlock, but for myself all I had to do was put in the new SIM card and it worked straight away without any further troubleshooting needed.\nIt took about 12 days (8 working days) total to unlock, so well below the 20 day estimate so I was definitely pleased.\nWell done iphoneimei.net and thank you for your help- highly recommended!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:58:15.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

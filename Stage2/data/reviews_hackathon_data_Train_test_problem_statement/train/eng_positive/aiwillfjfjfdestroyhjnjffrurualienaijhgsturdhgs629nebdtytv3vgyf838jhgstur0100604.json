I was helped by someone called Maria and she went out of her way to help us as we had a problem with our initial booking. However, Rental cars should explain clearly what someone should do when they approach the car hire desk. For example, when at Faro the car company started intimidating us showing us files that said insurance from rental cars was not valid and we will make you pay a lot of money if you don't buy insurance from us. They also made us purchase a device to pay toll charge in case went on the A22. They said that if we didn't but the device and we had to pay the toll they will charge is a heavy fine and it is worth buying the device. We agreed to buy it but I can assure anyone going there that the road signs are so clear that you don't need to pay that money.\nI wish rental cars would have advised us of these scare tactics in advance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:04:35.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

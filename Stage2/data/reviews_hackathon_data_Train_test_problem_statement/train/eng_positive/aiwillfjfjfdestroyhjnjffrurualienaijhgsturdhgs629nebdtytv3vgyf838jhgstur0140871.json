My most recent order was a little delayed due to a supply issue, the communication from the company was swift and clearly explained the reason for the delay. The order was filled and despatched as quickly as they were able and I could not be happier with their excellent and respectful customer service. I highly recommend this company.\nSandi", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T18:46:04.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

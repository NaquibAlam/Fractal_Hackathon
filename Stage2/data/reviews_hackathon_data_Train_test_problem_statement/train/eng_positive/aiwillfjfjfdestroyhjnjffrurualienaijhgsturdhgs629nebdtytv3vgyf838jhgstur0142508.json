The men disconnected my old machine and reconnected the new one. Away they went with my old machine. Great, I used the new machine and all was well. On the Monday I woke up to a floor covered in water! I could hear water but couldn't work out where it was coming from. Low and behold it was coming from the old hot water pipe that hadn't been turned off properly or capped off. I now have blistered and ruined laminate flooring in the kitchen.\nI called AO.Com and more men came at 7.10am and capped off the pipe. I am in the process of sorting out a claim for the flooring so I trust this will all be sorted soon. I have to say that so far I have been impressed with the customer service from AO.Com so I hope I will not be disappointed.\nSadly I have had to choose a different laminate as the original goes right through my dining room and I can't get a match. Still will choose a colour that will compliment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:05:06.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

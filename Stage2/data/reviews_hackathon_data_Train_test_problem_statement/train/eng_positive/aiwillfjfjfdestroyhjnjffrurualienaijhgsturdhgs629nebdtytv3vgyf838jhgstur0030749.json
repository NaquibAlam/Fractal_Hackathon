I was a stay at home mom for 16 years and cooked ALL the time. When our kids grew up I stopped cooking because.... what's the point. There is only 2 of us now.\nI then decided that It probably wasn't good for us to not eat dinner or only snack and a co worker suggested that we try this.\nI decided to use a \"first week free\" coupon from her and We are hooked. We do 3 meals a week and that works for us.\nI hope this helps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:20:28.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

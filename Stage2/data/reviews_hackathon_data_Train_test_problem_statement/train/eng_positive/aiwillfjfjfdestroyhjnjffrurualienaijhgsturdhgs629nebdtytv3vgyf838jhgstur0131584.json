I work full time and as much as I want to provide great meals (my family is spoiled), there are times that grocery shopping at 6 pm is hateful, only to come home, lug the food inside, cook and then cleanup. HELLO FRESH has been a blessing -life just got easier. Three times a week I come home and I know I have EVERYTHING I need to make fantastic meals. The recipes and choices are amazing and the results surpassed my expectations. The other night my husband came into the kitchen to watch, and then he joined in, and then he took over! Never EVER has that happened. He (we) had so much fun. When we sat down to eat he kept commenting how the great dinner he cooked was. I'm thinking I may just leave him alone to cook while I get some time to run to the health club! One more thing...I am gluten free and although there are some gluten free choices, I check ahead of time to see what has gluten. I substitute things so I can still make the meals (for example crushed corn flakes for Panko crumbs). It's simple. delicious, and it frees up my evenings.

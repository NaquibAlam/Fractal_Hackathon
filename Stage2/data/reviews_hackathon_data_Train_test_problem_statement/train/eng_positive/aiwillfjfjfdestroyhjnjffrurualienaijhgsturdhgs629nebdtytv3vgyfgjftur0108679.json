Got both in good condition, well branched with lot of roots in it. One tree had no hydrating gel and paper wrapper. It was left opened in the transit, may be the mistake of the person who prepared the tree for shipping. I planted both immediately upon the package delivered in my garage in my nice backyard.Both tree will get lot of sunshine. Looking for a beautifull POM with lot of leaves and flowers in the spring. I dont know it will bear any fruit in the first year. POM is my favourite fruit.\nThanks Willis...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:26:35.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

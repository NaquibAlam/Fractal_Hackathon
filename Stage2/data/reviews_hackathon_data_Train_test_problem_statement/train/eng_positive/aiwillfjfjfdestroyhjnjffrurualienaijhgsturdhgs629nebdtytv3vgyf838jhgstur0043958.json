I called TicketCity and got a live person, he had same tickets as was listed on web. I purchased and received tickets 3 days later by FedEx and updates by email of shipment. The 'live' person on the phone gave me his direct number and name if I had any problems or would like to make future purchases. I will definitely be using TicketCity in the future.

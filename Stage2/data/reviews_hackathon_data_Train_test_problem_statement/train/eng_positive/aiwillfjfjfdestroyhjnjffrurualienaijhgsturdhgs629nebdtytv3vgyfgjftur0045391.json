This way my first time doing something like this by mail and I appreciated that the company e.mailed me when they had a problem with my frames but let me know right away that it would only take a little longer for them to fill the order. I spoke with someone over the phone and they were easy to reach and talk to. When they arrived I tried them on and the fit was perfect. I already have plans to order my next pair of lenses through LensFactory.

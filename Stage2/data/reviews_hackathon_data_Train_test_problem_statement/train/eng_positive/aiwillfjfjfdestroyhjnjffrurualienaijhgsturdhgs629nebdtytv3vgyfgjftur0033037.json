Unfortunately, I'm not 'handy'. I spent a lot of time looking for tools and products to transform my space with my skill level in consideration. Mirror Mates product did just that. The ordering process was easy and took all things into consideration. My only issues was short arms and no assistant to help measure a mirror far wider than my wingspan.\nThe pieces came in and assembly was relatively easy. The reason I rated 4 instead of 5 was because of this. The videos on their site make it look easy to push the begs in that are used to connect the corners. I had to hammer all of them in. Plus, four of them didn't have holes drilled down far enough so I could push (hammer) them in flush per the instructions. Fortunately they went down far enough to not impact the pieces that attach to the frame.\nI had to wait a few weeks for an assistant to come over to help hang the frame. That was a piece of cake. The final product has completely transformed the space. I'm very happy with it.\nI do wish I could still use glass cleaner on the mirror. Simply because it is easier to do. However, I would still recommend it to others and purchase again should the need arise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:08:37.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

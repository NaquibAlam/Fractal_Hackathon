Ticket prices were very good compared to other sites. E-tickets arrived very quickly with airline booking reference numbers noted. Booking was an extremely easy process. I also had to call FlightHub to cancel an insurance I accidentally purchased while booking. Wait time for my call to be answered was no more than 5 minutes and issue was resolved immediately and without difficulty. Agent was very professional and helpful. A very positive experience using FlightHub for the first time. I will certainly use them again for future travel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:10:23.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

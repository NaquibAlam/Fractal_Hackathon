Its brilliant!!!! Very easy for him to use and loud enough for him to hear (he has hearing difficulties). I work with disabled adults and have a young man with down syndrome who recently got a KISA also. He is very proud of his new phone and seems to be getting the hang of using it very quickly. Highly recommend this product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T09:26:57.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

But wait till you have to return something to those other guys, or need professional advice on product features, compatibility or such the like. Forgetaboutit! B&H has the best, most informative web site, consistently good pricing, liberal and efficient return policy. In short, B&H will get you the best price and ensure your satisfaction. And if you ever have the chance to visit the Superstore in New York City in person, you will feel like you just won a golden ticket to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory!\nNo I am not on the take to B&H, I simply have received the most professional customer service experience these last 11 years of being a regular customer. To be truly honest though, I always feel like they are fleecing me when I sell them my used gear, so if you have the patience to deal with eBay you will get better price for your stuff selling it yourself online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T20:53:16.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

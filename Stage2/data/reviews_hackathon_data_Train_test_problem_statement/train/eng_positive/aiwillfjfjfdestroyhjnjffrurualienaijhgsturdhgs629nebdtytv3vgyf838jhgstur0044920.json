I bought my 2012 prius three weeks ago and I wanted to give it an oil service, looked up micks garage for oil and filter and I could not find a better price anywhere.Then I wanted new mats as you do when you buy a new car, again micks garage came up trumps, (not donald). So to finish off my new car look I wanted front door wind deflectors and again micks garage was the best price. But to me it's not all about price, service is just as important. I collected my parts @ the main depot and met Colin on the sales desk, lovely fellow and and a wealth of knowledge.He even helped me fit fit the deflectors when he got a few minutes. To sum up, I will definitely be going back to micks garage.\nMichael.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T05:36:26.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

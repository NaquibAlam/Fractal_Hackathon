I had emptied it out but it was still in very good shape, and I now had another need to use it. However, at some point the lock button on it had been inadvertently pushed in. Having no idea where the key was after so many years, I dug out two rings of old keys which I had long ago forgotten what they went to. To my surprise, one of the last ones I tried unlocked the cabinet. Wondering if I could still get extra keys, I found the lock company's name imprinted on the front of the lock cylinder. Also, the key code was still readable on the key I found. I did a search online and, to my amazement, found that not only was the company still very much in business, there was a link for \"Replacement Keys\" on the website which took me to EasyKeys.com. I followed the link to \"File Cabinet Keys\" and was completely blown away when I found the key code still listed. I ordered 3 keys for a very reasonable price with free shipping, received them in just a few days and found that all three of them worked perfectly. Needless to say, I was, and am, extremely happy about the entire experience! The only reason I gave a 5 star rating was that I could not give a 6 or more!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T21:14:19.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The one time an order was delayed (due to being out of stock), they shipped the items that were in stock, and overnighted the one that wasn't as soon as it was back in stock. They're always quick to ship orders out, and much cheaper than many other places I've bought from in the past. I have nothing but praise for Save On Lens! I would absolutely reccomend them to anyone with contacts!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T13:59:07.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

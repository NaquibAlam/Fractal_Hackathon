Totally the hotel's fault and I had to go out onto the street to find another hotel as it was 10pm. Found a hotel which was charging 4X the amount and had to take it. Called Agoda to tell them of the issue and they agreed to pay for the new room no argument. Was very impressed. Have a complaint with booking.com however they are ignoring all of my emails. Will definitely be booking through Agoda in future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:07:24.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

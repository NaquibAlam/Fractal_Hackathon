The prices are unbeatable for the quality. If it's written in the product description, that's exactly what you can expect and more! After a few online purchases I took a trip to the closest store front with some of my girls from the gym.. As soon as we walked in we were in heaven! The sweetest store clerk stocked up our fitting rooms with everything we were grabbing off the shelves and made it such a fun experience. We were able to try on outfits and have a mini fashion show between the three of us to narrow down our picks. It was so much fun and the workers were so helpful with finding different colors and sizes. I can't wait to go back and expand my wardrobe, but for now I will continue to do so online. Oh, how could I forget?? I now have an adorable water bottle and hat on the way thanks to my points just from reviewing my purchases! Being a member of fabletics is truly a gym goers dream come true!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:10:15.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

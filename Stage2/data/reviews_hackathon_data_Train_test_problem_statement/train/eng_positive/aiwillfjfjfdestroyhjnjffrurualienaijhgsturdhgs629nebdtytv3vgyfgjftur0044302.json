It's always cool to see what new baits come each month and to be introduced to new products. Customer service is top notch. Shipping to Canada is free, what more could i ask for?!?\nAnother neat feature is the Catch Co. boxes that are offered. it's a great way to get a bunch of predetermined baits at a fraction of the price. I've grabbed a few of these boxes in the past and i managed to scoff an amazing deal on BioSpawn soft plastics on black friday for 40% off.\nYou won't be disappointed by MTB, and you are guaranteed a 90% increase in hook up ratio! ;)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:59:53.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Not something you'd think was synonymous when dealing with a situation of back taxes. That's exactly the way I felt. The team wrapped me up in this perverbial protective blanket and handled everything from start to finish. I've recommended them to a few people. As they also prepare yearly individual taxes they'll have my business for life. Big thank you to Derrick Knorr, Kathleen O'Connell and the rest of the Community Tax Team.

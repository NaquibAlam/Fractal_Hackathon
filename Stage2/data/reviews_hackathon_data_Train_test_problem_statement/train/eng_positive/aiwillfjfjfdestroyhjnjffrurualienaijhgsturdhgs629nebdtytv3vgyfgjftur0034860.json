I am a part time fitness instructor in the city teaching about 10 classes a week, and a full time medical scientist in the East Bay. I want to eat healthy, and I try to cook as many of my meals as possible at home. Sometimes I am just too busy or too tired to do it, though. Then comes Munchery. This is a game changer. I just hop online to see the menu and put an order in to be delivered to my doorstep that evening. I don't even have to be home to receive the order. I can see all the nutrition information before I order, and can see customer reviews as well. This is a thousand times healthier than takeout/delivery, and more convenient as well. I picked my delivery window, and even received a text message saying my order would be delivered soon. The portions were a perfect size, not too big not too small. I ordered a side with one of my entrees and had enough to make two meals out of it. The quality is great too! The food is delicious. I am so pleased. I will be telling all of my friends and clients about Munchery, and can't wait to place my next order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:28:45.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have a drone that I have had for less than two months now and I have been having nothing but issues and problems. One of my motor burned out so I searched online for a new motor. When I stumbled upon RC planet.com I was skeptical in the reviews were up-and-down. So I signed up and said what the hell and purchased a new motor. I was prepared and used to waiting weeks upon weeks from websites for my order to come in not with RC planet.com my order literally came in less than five days later. I was extremely surprised, but happy and excited so I installed my new motor to my surprise it was faulty I became extremely aggravated and just gave up on my project. So then I thought why don't I try to contact the company I bought it from so I did and I called them they directed me to a gentleman in their tech department named Todd and I discussed my problems and issues with him and explain to me what was going on and what would happen and that he would try to get a hold of the company that manufactures the motor. To my surprise the company never got back to Todd and Todd emailed me back and told me RC planet will replace the motor and the other part the faulty motor caused to break as well. I was extremely surprised and let me tell you never in my entire life have I had a company so dedicated to help a customer and fix this problem, Todd you were absolutely wonderful and I give your company five stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:48:56.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

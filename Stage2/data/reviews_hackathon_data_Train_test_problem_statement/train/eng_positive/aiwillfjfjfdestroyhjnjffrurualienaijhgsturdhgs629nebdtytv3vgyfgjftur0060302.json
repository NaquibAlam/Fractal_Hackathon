I run a brick and mortar business with multiple small entities in the fray. I LOVE my job and I HATE accounting! In the past, working with my accountant/bookkeeper was difficult because I do not understand Quickbooks at the level they do. Honestly, I don't want to. Bench.co has lifted a giant weight off my shoulders and freed up my time so I can focus on earning the money and working with clients, meetings, calls, etc.\nSUPER easy to upload documents, and ANYTIME you have a question you can message your \"hand-holder\" in the app/site for an answer. AND rather than trying to pull reports from QB, which I find to be super NON user friendly, your PNL and other reports are automatically on your home page in graph format. SO EASY to see where we are each and every day!\nAlso, they provide an easy login for your CPA and even work with my payroll company to make everything seamless. AND they provide the same contact person at Bench to answer payroll questions. (with GUSTO, payroll services)\nThank you bench for everything you do and will do for my family and our businesses!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T21:12:37.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

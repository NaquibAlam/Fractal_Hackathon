They informed me of their fair and reasonable rates, showed me the facility, and gave recommendations on a storage size. They were very accommodating to my questions and concerns and I felt I was given true and honest answers.\nThe facility I store with has a manager living on site, cameras galore, gated, clean and well maintained. I felt confident in storing my items there. Any doubts were soon squelched touring the facility.\nLocation is not too bad, right off a main road, pretty accessible and easy to get to. In addition, I felt confident there wouldn't be any weather issues affecting the facility.\n5/5 Would and have recommended~", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:48:03.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

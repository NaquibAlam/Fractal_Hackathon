It was so great to have a place to organize all the hotel information and to be able to compare in one portal. And it was extremely user-friendly. SO easy to navigate. I also thought it was perfect that I was assigned an advisor- one person to manage everything for me from start to finish. I hate services where I talk to a different person every time I need something. My advisor, Michael, was very helpful. I would recommend Skipper to everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:48:02.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

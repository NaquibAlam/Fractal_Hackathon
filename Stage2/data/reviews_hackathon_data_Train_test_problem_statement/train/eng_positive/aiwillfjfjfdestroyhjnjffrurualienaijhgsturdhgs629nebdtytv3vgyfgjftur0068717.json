What a fantastic customer service.\nThe hair is lovely, my boyfriend and mom even asked me to try wearing even longer hair in bright colors so letâ€™s see how that goes.\nI do think that invisible tape-ins nowadays work much better than clip-ins and i wonder when you will have thicker tape hair in 20pcs available as i can't wait to try out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:36:42.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

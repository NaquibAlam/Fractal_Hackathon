The construction is very tight and well done. I really like the way the top is made and how beautiful the wood is. I bought the off white with oak top that matches my other furniture. The only issue I had was not with the furniture company but the moving company and their lack of communication on the bringing of the furniture. I had to initiate all the communications with them. Should be the other way around. The actual guys who did bring the furniture opened up the two pieces outside the door. Allowed us to check them all over including the bottoms. They promptly brought them into the house. Offered to wear boots over the shoes to protect our floors. Showed us how to put on the knobs. They were wonderful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:42:58.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

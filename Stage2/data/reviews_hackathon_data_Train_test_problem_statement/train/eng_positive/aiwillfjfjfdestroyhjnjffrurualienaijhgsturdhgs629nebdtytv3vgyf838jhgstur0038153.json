The cover I put on it was a piece of junk and when dropped it broke the screen and the LCD. The paperwork for filing a claim was easy to complete and they even provided an upload link to allow scan and send. Sean was assigned to assist me. His replies were immediate and he was patient in answering my long list of questions. A loaner phone of the same make/model being sent for repair was offered at no charge with overnight delivery. My phone was returned in less than one week and looks like new. The experience led me to refer eSurranty to my brother for his laptop. A repair to my phone without this insurance would have been over $400 due to screen & LCD for the largest iPhone available. Highly, highly recommend!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T21:15:27.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I like to try new recipes, but I don't like to buy a lot of ingredients where I will have leftovers in my pantry because what if I try something but don't like it? HelloFresh is the perfect solution. Ingredients for new meals arrive each week, with just enough quantity of ingredients to make the meals without leftover wasted ingredients. The fruit and vegetables are fresh, the meat is high quality, and all of the other ingredients are perfectly proportioned. The recipes are simple and easy to follow, and I have thoroughly enjoyed most of my meals. I have had a chance to try some foods and spices I might not have otherwise tried, but since you can choose your meals each week (classic plan), you can choose to stay safe or to try something out of your comfort zone. The servings are large. In fact, I cut the servings in half and get twelve servings instead of the six servings that are typically with the three meal box for two people. Since I can stretch the meals further, I find that it is no more expensive that what I would normally spend when eating healthy. In conclusion, I recommend this company to everyone, and in fact I am frequently showing off my meals to my co-workers and students and telling them to give HelloFresh a try!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:53:10.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

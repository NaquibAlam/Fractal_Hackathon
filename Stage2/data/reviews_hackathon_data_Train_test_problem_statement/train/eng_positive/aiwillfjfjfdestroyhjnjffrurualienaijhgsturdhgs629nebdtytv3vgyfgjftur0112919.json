And even if you do go to Asia to go on a shopping spree, it's likely that they will have only limited lines of seasonal styles.\nWhat really makes Yesstyle great is that you can actually shop their products no matter where you are and whenever, for whatever season you want the style to be. I've always been jealous of the quality that the asian products bring compared to the ones I've shop in us-they are so behind in fashion it's so hard to think you've shopped well when you are paying as twice as much.\nPROS-\n1)all the great styles, cosmetics, other products all in one place\n2)easy to browse, I love how they separated styles by country also\n3)easy to purchase\n4)sales and promos help you motivate shop\nCONS-\n1)a bit of a price increase, which is understandable, but sometimes for coats or jackets I feel like they've been priced too high compared the original price. I check the original prices in their websites and compare, and it certainly does not make me happy when the price has been nearly doubled.\n2)needs a little more update on beauty products. Maybe it's because they have expiration dates? But I've found many cases where one of the most popular cosmetic products are not sold at all on yesstyle. One in particular was peripera's ink the velvet set.\n3)A *little* tweak on the menus for browsing. I love the product listing page, but when I open the menu to find a certain product there are so many categories it's sort of overwhelming to look all the way down to find something you're looking for.\n4) Korean fashion- This page definitely should not list Korean cosmetics. When I think of fashion I just think of clothes? I had a hard time trying to find page after page to look at just clothes while blinding so many cosmetic products in between..\n5)phone app?\nI feel like phone app- I don't know if you guys do but- would make things so much easier. Or incorporating the basic design principles of phone app in many ways would be very helpful. It's gone simpler and when I look at all the menus and lot of ads I think of the websites I visited in the 90s.\n6)membership reward expiration policy.\nI feel like you guys can find a way to keep the membership points but change the policy so that a customer is not bummed to find out what they've used all year long is gone at once. It almost made me not want to shop here anymore. For sure the membership points don't motivate me to shop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:20:46.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I mean, it's a really good deal, but I was a little worried about getting tangled up in one of those messes where you can't get off the list, can't get ahold of customer service, and you keep getting charged even after you cancel. But, I've also dealt with Comcast, so I went into it with battle-tested armor.\nThe experience I have had is the absolute opposite of everything I was afraid of. They are communicative, available, their website is clear, you get email updates on the process, etc. I actually went back to this site just to see when those negative reviews were left, thinking maybe they had a rocky start at customer service but then got their act together. But seeing now that many of them have been left relatively recently, I felt like I had to say something in defense of this company.\nIf you were unaware that you were being put on a list and would be (eventually) charged a monthly amount, I have no idea how you made it to adulthood. They sent me emails like every 4 days, telling me what number I was on the waiting list to be an Angel, and how my money would be invested in wine making. Then, after about 1.5-2 months of email updates (ample time to cancel, had I wanted to), I got an email telling me I had made it, and then a separate email with the subject line: \"Your account will be charged in 3 days.\" Pretty hard to miss. Then THEY CALLED ME, just to make sure I was happy with the amount they charged (offering to change it, cancel it, etc), asked me to explain to them my understanding of how the process works (to ensure my comprehension), and in general made absolutely sure I was happy with the process. I cannot fathom what more they could possibly do to communicate or provide good customer service.\nSo, I realize that online reviews should always be taken with a grain of salt. Typically only grumpy people care enough to write them. But these negative reviews made me grumpy enough to write a positive review about Naked Wines, because honestly, I get the solid sense that these are some good guys - not perfect, but really and truly passionately trying to do something great.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T23:34:15.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This summer will be our second time using CRV. The level of service provided is outstanding. The customer service is personalized and highly responsive. The accommodations recommended were by far some of the nicest we have stayed in throughout the Caribbean and Central America. The highly advertised 24/7 service is not a joke. On our first visit to Costa Rica, there was a pirate taxi strike on the day we were headed from Manuel Antonio back to the airport. This caused significant travel delays. While ultimately we were in time to catch our flight, throughout the 6 1/2 hour ordeal, CRV and its in country staff were in contact with us, our driver and the airport to ensure that whatever the outcome, we were taken care of. The entire length of our visit, we felt confident knowing that CRV would be there if we needed anything. The fact that we called Molly when we were thinking of a return visit should say enough. Hands-down one of the best organizations we've worked with in the travel industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T14:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:16:53.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I first came to the website I was really skeptical, because the price was cheap compared to other places where you would buy over-the-knee-boots. When I read through the reviews they were all so positive, so I decided to buy a pair for myself. It came in and let me tell you girls, I am SHOOK. So happy that I ordered from them! I could not be any happier. I would totally recommend, they have so many cute boots on here. I am definitely going to buy more shoes from here. It is definitely true to size & appearance. Girls, get yourself a pair before they run out in your size!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T15:46:46.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Upon arrival at the San Jose airport, we were efficiently assisted to clear immigration and customs. All drivers always showed up on time, their cars were in excellent condition, their driving prudent and their command of English sufficient to entertain interesting conversations. Hotels selected were of first quality and very well located. Tour guides in the two national parks visited (Arenal and Manuel Antonio) spoke perfect English and were very knowledgeable. We were extremely pleased with CRV efficient assistance and would not hesitate to recommend them if your objective is to spend a hassle-free vacation in a beautiful and very friendly country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T23:01:47.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

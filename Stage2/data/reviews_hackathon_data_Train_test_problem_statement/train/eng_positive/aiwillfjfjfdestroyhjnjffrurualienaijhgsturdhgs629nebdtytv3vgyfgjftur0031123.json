I work nights and the team at Quicken Loans respected my sleep hours, working around my schedule, unlike the traditional bank that my original loan was from. The loan was closed in about half the time as the original loan as well. We were given a real appraisal, not one that made the bank look good. The team that worked with me were wonderful, they answered all of my questions fully, so there were no surprises or the feeling of being ignored. There were no delays in the closing. For all of these reasons, I thank Quicken Loans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:27:52.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I maintain a Little Free Library and TB offers me hundreds of titles at inexpensive prices when I need to replenish it. The condition of books I receive is never less than advertised and often is much better than advertised. Their website is user-friendly and they respond to questions via email very quickly. I love the discounts, too. I live in a far northern, very small community, and sometimes books I want to read are not available within our regional library system or from the state-wide system...but almost always Thrift Books will have a copy. And when I am done reading a book, I donate it to my local library for their annual book sale. Everybody wins!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:09:06.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Our agent was Richelle who was efficient, friendly, professional and an excellent communicator. We were asked about the standard of accommodation we wanted and what we wanted to do and then the trip was organised for us.Apart from the things we knew about, Eclipse recommended and organised a range of interesting experiences that really added to the trip.\nDocumentation we received with our itinerary was clear and detailed and the emergency contacts provided were very reassuring. The companies they subcontract to in South America are very professional and reliable. Accommodation chosen for us was excellent. It was always central which allowed us to explore on foot.\nOverall Eclipse is a company we have recommended to our friends and we would certainly use again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:05:56.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

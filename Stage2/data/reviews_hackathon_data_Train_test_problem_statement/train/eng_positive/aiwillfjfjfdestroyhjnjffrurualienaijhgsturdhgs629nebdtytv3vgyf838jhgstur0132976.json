When I called to make the appointment the woman I spoke with was very nice, informing me of the cost of the visit and offering me a few different appointment times for me to choose. She gave me good directions and also was able to let me know the proper way to transport my pet to their Jackson office.\nWhen I arrived for my appointment the office was clean and not busy. The vet tech and vet were both patient in listening to my turtles symptoms and then clear in explaining what they needed to do to help my turtle. I was presented with a print out of the Care Plan and it's associated break down of costs before they proceeded to treat my turtle. I was given medicine to take home and clear instructions on how to properly treat my pet. I felt that the prices were fair for the treatment and time given. Will definitely return and recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:38:35.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

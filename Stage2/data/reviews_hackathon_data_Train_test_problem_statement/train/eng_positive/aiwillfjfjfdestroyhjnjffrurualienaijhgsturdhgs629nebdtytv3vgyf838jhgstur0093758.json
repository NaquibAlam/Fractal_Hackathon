The cupcakes were raved about by all recipients. The vanilla bean cake was moist and delicious and a big hit! The Boston Creme pie was lovely and the packaging superb. The black/white cake was disappointing in that it was a bit stale tasting. I will not order that one again. Also, of the six packages - only four were delivered by noon as promised. So, I don't really think it pays to order overnight delivery. I think one should plan ahead when ordering here. I will definitely order again as overall it was above average, gourmet quality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:47:17.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

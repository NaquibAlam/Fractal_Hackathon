I know you can scroll up and review. I made a mistake and booked the wrong flight, very similar but the return flight had 2 layovers, 3 and 4 hrs. I am traveling with a 6 month old and that is just not feasible. So I called right away and still had to pay 75$ to cancel. So the deal on the flight was not quite as good. All in all was easy to cancel and rebook and the people helping me on the phone were very polite and helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:25:46.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

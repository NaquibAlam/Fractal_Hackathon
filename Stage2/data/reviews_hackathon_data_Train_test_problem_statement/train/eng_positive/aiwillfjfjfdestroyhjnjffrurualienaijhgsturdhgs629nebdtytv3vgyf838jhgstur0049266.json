I didn't get many upgrades since I am fairly well equiped. They were able to easily carry me through and have ways to skip a lot of the unneeded places. That was especially good for me since my time was tight. Very good group of people that I would highly recommend!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T21:50:01.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

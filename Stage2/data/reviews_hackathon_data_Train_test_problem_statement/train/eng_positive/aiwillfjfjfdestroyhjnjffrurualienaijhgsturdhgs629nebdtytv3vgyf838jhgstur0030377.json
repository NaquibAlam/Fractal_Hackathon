Cavan and now, here in Glenties, Donegal, in the rural mountains, for 4 years now.\nI work as a semi-retired software engineer, so consume heavy bandwith, working remotely and having to download large (very large) software tools and so on.\nNow, to be fair others , I live within Line-of-sight of our local Radio Base Station's Antennae/Mast, so that explains the super fast speeds I get, most of the time.\nNevertheless, I have been very happy with Vodafone's Mobile Broadband service- even if a tad expensive- for 4 years now.\nThey've really helped my family connect to the rest of the world, and earn a living , thru remote working.\nI'm even able to conduct Teamviewer(remote desktop) sessions, and have hit up to (wait for this, drum roll ) 46 Mbps on my Huawei 4G dongle- but ona 3G Mobile Broadband SIM card!\nCustomer service is pretty useless though!\nInternet connection though is Amazing- given that we're in super rural Ireland, living inthe bluestack mountains.\nAs someone from London, where even other \"well known\" FIBRE providers only hit 100 Mbps, this is very impressive.\nOveral 7/10, based on my user experience over 4-5 years, using the internet for up to 3-6 hours each day, and doing heavy bandwidth engineers/technical work, with computers in other parts of the planet.\nWell done Vodafone!\nA++\nOverall marks 8/10.\nAnd thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T14:06:36.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

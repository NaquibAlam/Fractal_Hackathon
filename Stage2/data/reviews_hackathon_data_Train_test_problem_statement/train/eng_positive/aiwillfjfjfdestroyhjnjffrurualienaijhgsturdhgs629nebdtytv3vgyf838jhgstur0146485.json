We have over 20 printers in our organization in different locations and orders are always processed and dispatched promptly and received quickly by our staff. From the hundreds of compatible toners i have ordered over the years, we have only ever had one failure, and when i notified Ink Station, they replaced it immediately and the arrangements they made to pick up the defective one was made easy and hassle free. Excellent customer service. Because i order regularly, i can see how long each toner lasts and can say the product is very consistent and comparable with the original. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T09:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:20:56.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They are delicious. We tried other prepared meal companies and for us, Top Chef is the best. Food is excellent and healthy. Preparation is easy...just bake or microwave. Many great meals to select from, so we don't get bored. Great food similar that that of a good sit-down restaurant. Meals from other companies that we tried were so SPICY that we could not eat the food. Shipping is fast and meals arrive frozen (not partially melted as with some other companies that we tried).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:47:46.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

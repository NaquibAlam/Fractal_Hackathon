The apple tree looks get and I didn't have any problems planting it. The banana plant looked really bad. The base looked kinda moldy and the plant itself was really flimsy and week, within a few days of planting it, it turned brown and just collapsed. I figured it happened because I ordered two things and they were shipped together. I ordered another ice cream banana plant, it shipped alone and seems to be doing fine. Hopefully it will be worth double the cost.\nUpdate:\nAfter posting this review I was contacted by willisorchards.com. They were phenomenal! They addressed my problems and concerns in a very respectful and accommodating way. My plants are doing great, and I look forward to doing business with them in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:13:04.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

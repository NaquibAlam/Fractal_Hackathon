There are no doubt better sounding headphones but the wireless convenience makes up for the slightly tame listening experience.\nBattery life is great, can see these lasting the rated 20 hours with ease at moderate volumes.\nThe build quality is great, they are so lightweight yet premium feeling it's amazing. Compared to my other set of wired noise canceling headphones these are feather light and so much more comfortable.\nOverall I'd say 9/10 with only the slightly tame sound bringing them down, but Bose are aiming to please everyone with one pair of headphones (and they are definitely pleasing) so can't really fault them!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T11:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T13:57:46.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

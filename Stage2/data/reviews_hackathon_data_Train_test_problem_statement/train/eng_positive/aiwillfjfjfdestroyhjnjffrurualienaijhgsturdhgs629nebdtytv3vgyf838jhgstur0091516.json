At the time of the order Diesel Ops sent me the Installation Instructions so I could read them while I was waiting for the parts to ship to me. Not much for Instructions on removing the 8 exhaust sensors but you can watch a video on YouTube. Make sure you use lots of penetrating oil/spray on the lower EGR bolts for the long EGR pipe. These bolts will break on you! I started spraying them a week ahead of time and I still had to slowly work them back and forth with spraying in between working the bolts out and back in. I recommend slowly working these bolts before your parts arrive so you Installation will go faster. My bolts were still knurled after taking it slow with them. Use bolts from a different location when you put the new plate on. (The other bolts will have better threads left on them.) My only complaint is the smaller cooler lines come with a barb but no hose clamps and the factory uses a crimped clamp that is not reusable. Not a big deal if you have an Auto Parts store near you but I would recommend getting some ahead of time. You'll have lots of fun with the lower radiator hose connection. Take out the inner fender and have a Buddy on stand to help for a few minutes. The end product is very impressive and has a great sound with good turbo howl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:58:00.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

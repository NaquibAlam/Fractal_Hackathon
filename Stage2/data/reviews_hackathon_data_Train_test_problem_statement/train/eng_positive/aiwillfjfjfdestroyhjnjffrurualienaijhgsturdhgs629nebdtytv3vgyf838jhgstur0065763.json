I likes what saw, but felt it would be too much for me in looks and cost. Then recent I saw a newsfeed about the VIP customer choice and specials and decided to give it a try! I am turning 56 this month and I like to stay in shape by walking, biking, swimming, Aquacycle workouts and yoga. I'm am relatively conservative about color choices and how my body is displayed in clothing. I am small chested and don't want any tops or bras to flatten me out, but rather enhance me without padding. I have a little belly(I'm working on getting rid of!) so I like high waisted pants and shorts with compression to help tuck and hold me in comfortably! I'm excited about creating a new wardrobe of clothes for work to go out with fabletics fashions. So far with my first order as I get to know how your sizes fit me. I ordered a med dash seamless bra and it was nice I like everything about it except it flattened me out too much! So I'm returning it. I ordered the Aventura tank in a medium size and white color and I love, love, love it! Great fit,feel,and look! Exciting! I also ordered the Lissette high waisted Capri. And I was excited about the promotional deal offered with buy 2 for a bargain price! They came and I loved the feel and look of the fabric. I tried them on and loved the way they fit in the waist and hip area and loved how they look on my body. But, the compression in the legs was too much for this south Florida girl! In the heat and humidity I would die with such binding, I see how it would be awesome cooler dryer climates though! I had to return those lovely looking and feeling capris. Oh and I had ordered a small! And, so in my next order, I am trying out the Lissette shorts. I hope they are not to short for this old lady. But, I'm looking forward to that high waist! I also tried out the palisades tee in medium. It was a nice look. My daughter loved it on me. But I didn't find it comfortable. The half sleeve was a little binding at the end and the neckline kept falling off my shoulders with movement. And, I thought the length was too short. So I returned it! I went back on line this morning and found and ordered some more bras and tank tops and other exciting pieces! Can't wait to get them! I let you know how it goes! Thanks for your attention in this rambling review!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T11:06:26.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I found Bake Me a Wish on line by accident when looking for a florist in her area. I was so happy to be able to send her a cake on her birthday! There was a great selection of flavors to choose from and it arrived on time. I was even able to track the shipment, so I knew exactly when it got there. My daughter loved the surprise.

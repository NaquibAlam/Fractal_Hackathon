However, the website only lets you pay online for a delivery. If it's a collection, you have to pay in-store. This makes no sense, seeing as they already have the ability to take payment online. I rang the shop in Lucan. The man was very sympathetic but he was not allowed to take payment over the phone and he was therefore unable to resolve the issue. I could hardly ask my niece to pay for her own gift, so I had to make it a delivery, which was not convenient for her at all.\nFor a living I help businesses design how they should operate, so I can see areas for improvement in this process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T01:23:26.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Paid for my pre-loved Bi-metal Daytona which was delivered next day early morning as promised & packaged professionally well pleased. I then sent my trade in and within 3 days was offered & accepted my estimated price which was then paid in to my acc in 5 days. The whole process was simple & with having 14 day to return watch on when delivered says time in visiting shop while i live overseas.

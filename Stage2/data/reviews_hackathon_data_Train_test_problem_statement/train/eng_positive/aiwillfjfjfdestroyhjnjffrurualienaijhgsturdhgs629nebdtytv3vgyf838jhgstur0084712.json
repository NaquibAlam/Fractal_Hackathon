What should have been an easy 1-2-3 phone experience didn't quite turn out that way. It was apparant without her having to say, that Bonnie was a neophyte to the bill paying expereince. What a joy to find a courteous and emphatic representative who was upfront and honest about her relative newness to the organization. Because I knew and she iterated this upfront it was easy not to get upset and become impatience with Ms. Bonnie. I found her overall customer service handling exemplary and spot on. She was courteous, emphatic and had a phone presence that albeit new, she was more than capable of resolving the issue without being rude or dismissive. I for sure that if Smart Start hires and retains employees like Bonnie H., customers woll be more than estatic. Take a bow, Ms. Bonnie. You deserve it!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T19:24:58.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

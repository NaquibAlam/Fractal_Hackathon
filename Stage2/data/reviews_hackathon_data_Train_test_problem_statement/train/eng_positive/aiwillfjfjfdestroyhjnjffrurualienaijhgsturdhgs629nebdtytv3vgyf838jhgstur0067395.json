Thus, they are human. So, every experience cannot be great. When a customer has a bad experience, it's whether and how people take responsibility plus how fast and hard they work to make it right that counts. That's what demonstrates their heart, soul and integrity. As my original review below shows, I had a single bad experience w/UD. However, they responded immediately, took full responsibility. More importantly, they have and are going the extra mile to make certain it never again happens to me or any other customer. This is the mark of a great company run by outstanding people who genuinely care about every customer and about building long-term relationships. My original review gave them 2 stars, but their follow-up earns them a well-deserved 5 stars. UD has shown me that they are a company with true heart, soul and integrity. Surely they'll do the same for you. Although there may have been a J curve in the middle, thanks to UD, my transaction still turned-out to be a 5 star experience. Let me also extend my personal thanks to Ian for his quick reaction and diligent follow through. He is a true ambassador who wears the title of \"customer service\" with honor and does UD proud.\nOriginal Review:\nTook 5-6 attempts to register a domain, simply because, until the last attempt, UD's website failed to acknowledge my change of email address and send a verification email so my transaction could be completed. If my previous experiences hadn't all been happy and frictionless, this would have been a deal killer for the future. As it is, let's consider it a 1-off bad experience which is forgiven, but not forgotten. Letting UD know so it doesn't happen to me or any other user again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T10:01:57.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have always bought locally but can no longer find them so I look on the internet. American Frames has a nice selection and a reasonable price. I liked the fact that I did not have to stick with the stock lengths. I had a project that I was framing that was not quite 16\" in length, so I ordered 15 7/8\" which was perfect. A 16\" length would have been too large and it would have been hard to keep it in the frame. The package came in well packed and did not take very long to get here. I would order frames from American Frames again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:04:19.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

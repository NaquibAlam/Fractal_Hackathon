Later, the receipt turned up missing. This was back in 2012 and the warranty expired the following year, 12/29/2013. Performance was inconsistent and a royal nightmare. I have checked out multiple ways of fixing this, but landed on DriverSupport and relatively speaking, although it took the better part of five hours to complete, it fixed and updated all drivers.\nWhat a shocker! Sorry I put if off for so long. So I'll say 'so long'.\nGreat product, for sure!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:08:29.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

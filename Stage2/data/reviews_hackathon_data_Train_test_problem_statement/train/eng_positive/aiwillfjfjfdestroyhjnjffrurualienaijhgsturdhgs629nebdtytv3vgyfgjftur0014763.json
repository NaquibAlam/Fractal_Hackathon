The booking process was very easy and clear. We flew with vueling, who I had never flown with before, and was pleased that we arrived slightly early. The hotel was just as described and was fantastic. Lastminute.com even made us aware of the city tax in Amsterdam that we would have to pay directly to the hotel. Everything was perfect until the flight back where we were delayed for two hours. I overheard some passengers complain that vueling were regularly late, which was something I'd have liked to have been aware of. But lastminute.com did keep us updated on the delays by notifying me when something changed. Overall, a good holiday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T20:38:55.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I love all of their policies - the only thing I believe could be improved is your customer service. I had a package that was not delivered (DHL's fault), but Ssense's customer service (multiple individuals) repeatedly assured me that it was at my local UPS store; I should have known better, because this NEVER is the case, but finally my package STILL was not delivered, so I had to take it to DHL, where I had an absolutely horrible experience (they are the worst, as many other individuals attest to, and I have no idea why companies ship through them/don't complain to them more to resolve their problems). Nevertheless, although the issue was eventually resolved by Ssense representatives, the quality of Customer Service simply is not consistent; while at times excellent, at times I also found it to be utterly deplorable. The management level Customer Service representatives were absolutely excellent, but I got the feeling from the lower tier representatives that they simply did not want to help me and that I was wasting their time (and hence the horrible experience).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:58:51.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

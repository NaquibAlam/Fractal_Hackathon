We spoke with Rachel who planned our trip with us after a long conversation with my husband about our interests and things we wanted to see and do. The itinerary presented was well put together and everything went smoothly throughout our trip. It was nice to have someone else do the planning. Rachel got back to us in a timely manner if we had questions and always followed up with a call despite the time difference as we are in Canada. I would definitely use Jacada again. We enjoyed the privacy of the trip and all the details they presented. This was definitely a once in a life time trip!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:11:21.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have ordered several books from Thrift Books and I have been completely satisfied with every book. Each one I have received has been in terrific shape, practically new condition! No problems of any kind. The prices are unbelievable! My husband and I live on his Soc. Sec. retirement, and my SS Disability, so we are not able to buy brand new books. We both have mobility issues, don't get out a lot, so reading is my escape and one of my favorite forms of entertainment. Thanks to Thrift Books, I am able to indulge my love of reading. Thank you again so much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:09:36.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was able to track my order and it took just over 9 days from order to delivery. The TV was in great shape and the price was fantastic.

I would recommend iElectric for sure and will look to them for future purchases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T22:10:29.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

No particular reason but I simply had not tried them before and I was a little hesitant about not sticking with what I had used before.\nHowever their pretty damn good prices and the ratings from the TrustPilot reviews helped to give me the confidence to try them out.\nI first created an account, all went well.\nI placed my first order and it too seemed to go well enough.\nHowever finally the order was rejected and I was sent a generic email listing the possible reasons as to why that my money was going to be refunded.\nI mailed them back to ask for specifics. Then I was informed that it was due to my IP address, I use a VPN service.\nI had no idea that using a VPN would prevent an order from completion and nothing was flagged at either the account creation stage or at the point of placing the order.\nThe company agreed to fulfil that order, rather than refund me. All was good.\nI placed my second order, not sure if I would still need to disable the VPN but I did. That order went through fine.\nOverall I'm impressed with the service as I reckon that if I had not used the VPN service then none of the above issues would have occurred.\nHowever whilst there is a small notice (point 4) about a VPN and that you should disable it that could have been flagged at the account creation stage and not after a payment and a debit for software which would ultimately fail as a transaction due to using the VPN.\nThe VPN issue should have been picked up by the company when the account was created or when the order was being placed and not after the money was debited.\nGood service and all worked out well in the end.\nI would use them again, just be aware if you use a VPN that there could be purchasing issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T17:56:46.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

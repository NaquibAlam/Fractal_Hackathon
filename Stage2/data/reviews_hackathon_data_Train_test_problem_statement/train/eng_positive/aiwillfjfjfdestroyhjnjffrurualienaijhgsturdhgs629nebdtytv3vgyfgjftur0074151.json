My university diploma is a non-standard size and I'd been putting off framing it for years because of the cost of custom framing. Once I realized I could get a frame from Michael's and have a mat cut to accommodate the odd dimensions, I googled around and found Matboard and More. It was easy to follow their directions for measuring the opening. I placed the order thinking if it didn't look good when I got it, at least I didn't spend too much money. The mat got here two days later and my diploma now looks fantastic!! Just as nice as a custom frame, and I spent a fraction of the cost. Very pleased with the product, the low cost, and the extremely fast shipping!! Best of all, I didn't have to leave the house to go to the mall. Great service!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T23:36:28.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After receiving the items I can say that I am very pleased with the quality of construction, look and feel of theater. I shopped around and this was by far the best value considering that the units are powered and include other features like top grain leather, ambient lighting, cup holders. trays which are all included in the base price.\nOn another note, these units ship fast; mine was here in less than a week. Additionally they do not require any type of tedious installation, just take them out of the box slide the back plate into the base unit, plug them in and your'e ready to go.\nLastly I had a quick question and called their 800 number, the call was answered by their customer service rep \"Fernando\" who was extremely helpful in answering my question.\nOverall great product, service and value, thank you...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:43:19.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

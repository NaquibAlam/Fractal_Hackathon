It's important to note that I am writing this review 3 months after receiving my Gamermodz controllers, because I wanted to thoroughly test the product, its durability and ease of use. I first discovered modded controllers after watching some pro COD Infinite Warfare events online, and I thought it would be a great Christmas present for my sons ages 10 and 12. The controllers can provide modded functions such as rapid fire, jump shot and several other functions.\nParents will quickly learn after a short time of shopping for custom controllers online that there are 1. Many companies selling these controllers and 2. They are expensive. I researched them all in great detail and decided to go with Gamermodz. The reasons were their presales support and ease of use. If I was going to spend over $100 for a PS4 controller, I wanted to make 100% sure the money was well spent.\nGamermodz is the original developer of modded programming. So you know their coding is up to date and works as promised. Also, enabling and disabling their mods is very easy. You simply press the buttons on the controller to enable/disable a mod.\nI had a ton of questions regarding the controllers, and when I called into their sales dept, the guy spent over an hour answering every question. I was very impressed, and their high level of support continued after the controllers arrived. Even more impressive!\nIf you are a parent and feeling overwhelmed with the choices and options within the modded controller market, look no further than Gamermodz. Call them and they will help you select the controller best for you kids!\nMarc Segal\nFather of two boys who love COD and their Gamermodz controllers", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:42:26.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I live in a gated community in Muscat, Oman, a country that has no effective postal service. So I purchased a print, and gave the shipping address as the DHL office in the shopping centre of my community. There followed several back and forth emails as first the shipping address was queried, then I was informed that Saatchi only use DHL for originals, not prints. I appealed to my Cstomer Service Rep to \" go the extra mile\", and they responded and made an exception, and ultimately, my print arrived. , which I'm happy with. It took around 3-4 weeks from ordering to delivery. I wouldn't recommend Saatchi to my friends in Oman as its too much hassle, but I would buy with confidence if I lived in a western country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T21:07:42.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I like buying from a company that offers clothes at reasonable prices especially workout clothes because there is so much wear and tear on them. However, I have not had an issue with my Fabletics clothing breaking, tearing or busting anywhere and I wear them AT LEAST four times a week if not more. Lastly, their clothes, especially pants in my opinion, fit all women in any size. My friends and I love Fabletics and we range from a size XS petite to a curvy L and XL. Fabletics truly fits all body types and they advertise that and are 100% true to it. I have no reservations ordering from this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T11:08:35.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

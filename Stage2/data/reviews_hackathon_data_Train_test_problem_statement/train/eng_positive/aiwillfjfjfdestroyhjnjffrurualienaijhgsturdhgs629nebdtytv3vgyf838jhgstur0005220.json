Easy prep, delicious food, and quality time in the kitchen with the wife. Wonderful instructions make every meal fool proof. Just deducting one star because we have had an occasional box that was missing an ingredient. Customer service has made amends each time. Also there have been a few produce items that arrived less than stellar. Over all, I highly recommend Hello Fresh to anyone looking to change up their meal menu. If it keeps us from eating out just one time per week, it's worth the cost.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:55:02.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

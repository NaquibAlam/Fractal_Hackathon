I've learned things from Ross that I haven't learned anywhere else. I'm not saying you shouldn't study other places as well (all the knowledge you can get will help you), but if you are considering spending money for more education within the stock market, Warrior Trading is the place to spend it. I've studied under some pretty well known names in the market but when I came to Warrior Trading to study under Ross, a lot of gaps within my trading strategy started to fill in. Important things too... I still have a long way until I consider myself a successful day trader, but I'm starting to see success in my trades and I feel like I wouldn't have been able to achieve that without becoming a student at Warrior Trading. Not to mention, Warrior Trading offers a broad range of trading styles: From day trading, to swing trading, to option trading, they have a trading strategy that will suit almost anybody. Everybody learns differently, but I have definitely started to see colors, so to speak, after turning to Warrior Trading. Not to mention that Ross always answers any questions I have and offers suggestions and I feel like he genuinely cares, which is a priceless benefit to me. Of course, your success will still solely depend on how bad you want it and how much time you are willing to dedicate to developing your skill in the market.. But if you are needing that extra something in your strategy or education, this is the place where I have started to find it. I would highly recommend Warrior Trading to anybody, and wouldn't think twice about it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T23:51:25.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Shopping for senior prom for my youngest daughter, we visited a couple of dress shops then shopped online. Promgirl had a wide selection and kept their word. We ordered the dress on Sunday, it shipped Monday (free ground shipping) and was delivered to our door on Thursday. The dress was nicely packaged, wrapped in plastic on a hangar, then boxed. I once ordered a dress online from another company and upon receipt found that it was thrown in a shopping bag, thus crumpled and dirty. I was pleasantly surprised by promgirl's product. The dress is as beautiful as we expected and it fits very well! Thank you Promgirl!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:23:22.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

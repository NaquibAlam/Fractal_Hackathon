If you read the complete review below you will see that I bought for the first time this week from Maine Lobster Now (MLN) 2 lbs of lobster meat so I could make some Lobster Roll for my family. Upon receiving my order some of the meat did not seem as fresh and I discarded it. Upon going back to MLN with that news, they issued me a partial credit and I agreed to give them another try. I love buying from companies that stand behind their product and service - I will be back again soon to give MLN another order! Our family loves lobster and has used several companies in New England for similar service, MLN is very competitive and their commitment to my satisfaction goes along way towards establishing loyalty with me! Bill Diederich ***\nWas really stoked about finding Maine Lobster Now as our family in Ohio love Lobster Rolls and we needed to once again scratch that itch with no trip to Boston in sight! Went online and enjoyed the well designed web site and the shopping experience was flawless. Waited a few days and got my order ship notice and tracking info just as expected ... arriving home from work eager to dig in Wednesday night to enjoy the experience. Things went sideways when I opened the 2 lb. bag of mixed lobster meat and found that most of it was fine but there was one clump of meat that smelled a bit fishy and looked like it was not holding up as well as the rest. We discarded the stinky pieces, rinsed all the meat really well, and ate the rest with no negative recourse. Overall experience was a disappointment relative to the other places we use to get fresh lobster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:54:39.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

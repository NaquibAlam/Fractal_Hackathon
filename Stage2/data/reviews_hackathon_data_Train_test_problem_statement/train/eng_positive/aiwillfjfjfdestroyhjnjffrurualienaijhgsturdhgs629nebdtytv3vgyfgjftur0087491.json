I was looking for a used inexpensive copy of a popular series and was running out of time before I finished the book before. All the book stores in town either did not have it or wanted way too much for a very used worn copy. I'm so glad I took a chance on Thrift Books because not only did they have exactly what I was looking for (plus the next two in the series) for a very reasonable price, it shipped free fast enough to get to me before I finished the preceeding book! I WILL be using Thrift Books again, maybe for all my book needs, and will absolutely tell my friends and family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:25:45.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

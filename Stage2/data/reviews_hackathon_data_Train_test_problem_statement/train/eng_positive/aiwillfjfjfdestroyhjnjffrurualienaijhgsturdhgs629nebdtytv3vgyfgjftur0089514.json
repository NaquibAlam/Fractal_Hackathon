The code was emailed to me and I entered it in only to find that the code had already been used. I then tried to contact them to let them know. I waited, with no response from them. For three days I tried to get some sort of response by messaging them over Facebook and emailing them. The only response I got was silence. Luckily I had made the purchase through PayPal so I filed a claim to try and get my money back. So far they have still remained silent without the slightest effort to try and right the situation.\nI will never buy through this site again and would warn anyone else to stay away. If you do decide to buy, use PayPal so you have some sort of protection when they try to rip you off.\n2/17/2017\nAfter seeing the review that was left here Gamecheap took extra steps to correct the issues that I had with my order. I am completely satisfied now and would consider using their site in the future again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:57:11.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

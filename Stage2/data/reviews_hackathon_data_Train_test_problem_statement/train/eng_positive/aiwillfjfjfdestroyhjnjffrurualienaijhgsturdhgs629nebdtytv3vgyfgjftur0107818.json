Program - Did not receive the welcome letter to the program though Joe mentioned to me in mail, I was admitted to the program, which starts on Jan 17th, 2017.( Co - Ordinator should take responsibility to communicate with the candidate before, during and end of the boot camp ( till date the certificate for the program not yet received)\n2. While the payment for the boot camp is done, there is a option to record your meal preferences, vegetarian in my case, I cannot understand the need for this, as this was ignored during the first three days and was lucky to get Veg option( Indian Cuisine) on the fourth day but was a disapointment for the other participants.\n3. Workbook needs to a color printout, with latest slides included and must be clear to read.\n4. Prof David made the class very interesting with his anecdotes and his unusual noises to attract the attention of the participant but I still feel the Professor ability has been underutilized( I kept hearing about Dr Sam, we could have had a session with him or instead of the meal option provide, who would be the trainer for the session, After hearing so much of Dr Sam, I would definitely like to attend his program)\nLastly, though I am happy the Management/ Organization is largely Indian has achieved so much in the field of training in US, I am also dissapointed, strategism has not moved much but accepted the Indian way of doing things", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:50:30.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

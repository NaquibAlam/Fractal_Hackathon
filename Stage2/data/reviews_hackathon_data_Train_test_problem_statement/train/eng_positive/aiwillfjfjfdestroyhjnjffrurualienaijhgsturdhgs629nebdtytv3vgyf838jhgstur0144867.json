We have been enjoying the water from the ionizer so much and no longer need to purchase bottled water, tremendously reducing the recycling, which I am very proud of as well. Water fromt he ionizer tastes so good and everyone in my family carries the water bottle, to school, gym, etc. We enjoy not only clean and healthy water but also will save money in the long run. The set-up was easy, and the customer service has been great, making things a lot easier.\nI strongly recommend to anyone who is interested~", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:35:39.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

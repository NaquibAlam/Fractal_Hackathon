I was a bit apprehensive about using the service however my local Ticketmaster Agency assured me it was perfectly legit and legal to use. Wanting to see Bruce Springsteen in Hanging Rock I went ahead and purchased a ticket for the show. Everything went smoothly, my first attempt didn't work out when the ticket chosen was no longer available. I tried again and was successful in purchasing my ticket. Confirmation was received of my purchase via email. There were no problems I attended the show and even met the man who had sold the ticket as his wife didn't want to go.\nI would use Ticketmaster Resale again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T09:05:22.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

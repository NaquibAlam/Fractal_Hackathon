Only needed small runabout for 3 days in Darwin. Decided on cheapest vehicle I could get.\nArrived at 5am from Bali got to Europcars counter about 6.00am all good.\nGot upgraded to Toyota automatic, near new nice clean little runabout. Great little car.\nDownside.\nHad to pay extra for \"Excess cover\" based on the \"Excess\" on their insurance policy being $4200.\nThis cover cost more than the total rental. It was dark still when we picked the vehicle up, so couldn't check for marks or damage, just told bay number to find vehicle.\nOnce it was light we found scratch marks on front panel from previously hitting concrete barriers. Took photos just in case.\nPick up bay was the furtherest away from the airport one could get.\nOk for us as we travel light but if u had a lot of bags/luggage and u were hit with a tropical rainstorm, it would have been very unpleasant .\nAlso told on pickup that we were restricted to 100km per day? This didn't bother us as we were staying local but should be stated in bold on advert?\nMaybe I missed it in the small print.\nGood:\nUpon return (5am) desk was attended so I could explain about the marls! Young lady said \"Was it a Toyota Corolla\" \"Yep\" \"oh that always happens,due to how low they are, no problems\"\nI had filled it up the previous night done about 200kms cost $17 (Darwin prices) so \"All good!\"\nSo all in all it was a pleasant experience without a lot of drama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:11:50.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They diagnosed the problem and were honest about the solution. They let me keep my car on their premises until i made up my mind about the repair costs. I have opted for a used rather than new transfer case for my car (a gamble on my part) and will service my car at another place. But, Greg, at Cottman's was forever understanding and, again as I said, he was totally helpful to me while I figured out where to get my car repaired.

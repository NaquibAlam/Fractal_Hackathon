My husband was diagnosed with cancer last March. I started researching ways of reducing our risk of cancer if the cause was environmental. The first place we started from was the water we drink. So I decided to buy M11 Ionizer and I have not one day regreted the money spent on it. It has done wonders for my husband, the difference is vivid. The water taste great and my husband actually drink more water which helped him to flush toxins of chemotheraphy out of his organs. The doctors were shocked that the chemo did not affect his liver or the kidney. The doctors were not told( if you do they will dismiss or discourage you right a way). My skin became clearer and l now enjoyed drinking water. I use the third grade alkaline water to cook rice unbelievably fluffy and the same water soaks my fruits and vegetables if they are not organic. I have recommended M11 Ionizer to my friends over all other brands.\nGreat support from service team every time !!!!\nHelen O.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:35:17.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

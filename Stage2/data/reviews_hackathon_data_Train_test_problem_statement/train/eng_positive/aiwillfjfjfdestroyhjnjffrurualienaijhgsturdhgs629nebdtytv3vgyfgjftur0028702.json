I need deep, wide boots. Keen was the manufacturer recommended to me, but I could not find a shop offering much choice in London. Found Castleberg Oudoors through Google search. Excellent helpful and prompt service and a good sale price for such quality boots in the colour I liked. Will use them again as the big high street stores don't always offer a wide range of choice. If only we had more independent stores in London!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T16:40:57.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

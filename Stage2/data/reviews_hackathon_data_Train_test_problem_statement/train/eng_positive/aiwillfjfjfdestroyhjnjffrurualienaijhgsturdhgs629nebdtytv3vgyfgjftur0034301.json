The first step was easy I told them what I had and what was wrong with each of them and they gave me an estimate for each of them (which was just short of $400 total). They gave me easy to follow instructions along with two pre-paid shipping labels! Within just a couple of days I received an email saying my computers were received and being analyzed. A few hours later I was sent another email saying that my checks with the previously estimated prices were in the mail and on their way! With that money I was able to buy a new computer that hopefully wont break as easily as Macs!!\nThis is the best way to make the most of your unused apple products!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:55:48.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I suggested to the person I spoke to that you look at Shutterfly (based out of the US) as a model as their online design program is fantastic and so easy to use. Yours was so hard that it may prevent me from using it again.\nIt would also be great if it was possible to just order 1 card, instead of the minimum of 10 in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T03:51:24.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

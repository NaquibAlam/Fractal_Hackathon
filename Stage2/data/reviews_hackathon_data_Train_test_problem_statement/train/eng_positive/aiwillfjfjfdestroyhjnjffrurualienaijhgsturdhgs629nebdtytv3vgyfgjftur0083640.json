There was a 4-week study period between the time I completed the course and took the exam. Phil was my instructor and was incredibly helpful and patient as he reviewed the course material with the class. The online study plan, laminates, and practice exams are worth their weight in gold and were absolutely critical to my success on the exam. I was determined to pass on the first try, and I'm so grateful to PMA for making my goal a reality!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:56:19.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

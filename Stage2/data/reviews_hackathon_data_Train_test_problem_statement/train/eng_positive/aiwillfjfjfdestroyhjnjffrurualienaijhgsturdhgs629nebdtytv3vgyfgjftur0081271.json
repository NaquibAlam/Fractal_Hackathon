It is always a peace of mind when you don't worry about running out of voice credit. I have family in 3 different countries and we talk almost every week and sometimes more than few times per week. The connection/reception is great and it never lets me down. And their customer service staff are so efficient! I had to call them once and the response and help were amazing! I don't know what I would do without KeepCalling. Thank you so much for making life easier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T11:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:49:06.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

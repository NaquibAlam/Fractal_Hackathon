Since 2014 taxes were done incorrectly the debt rolled over to my 2015 taxes. The Optima Team coordinated for me with the IRS ensuring tax years 2013, 2014 and 2015 were completed correctly and the tax debt payment was documented, received and closed by the IRS. Also I am eligible and will be utilizing the benefit of the Optima Tax Team to complete my 2016 taxes which is the ultimate Customer Service Satisfaction every tax payer should enjoy. The Optima Team is well deserving of a (5) star rating.\nWill Smith\nSpotsylvania County\nFredericksburg VA 22408", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T04:48:44.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Encouraged us to check the car out and add comments to the agreement before signing. We did find additional issues with the car, which were readily accepted into the contract. Car was as advertised - it was within the years specified on the web - no problems there. Radio reception terrible in South island - so having the car being able to USB connect to my iPod was a blessing - and the Corolla we had could move through the songs without touching the iPod - so music wise we were set. Cannot fault the car - clean and reliable. I think we did almost 4000 km in 22 days. My only quibble is on return - due to the drizzle we were told that the car would be checked later for any additional damage out of the rain, so we could not sign off on the condition of the car upon return. Thus, we ended taking photos of all sides of the car after we returned it before getting on the free shuttle bus back to the airport just in case ACE contacted us later and we needed evidence of the state of the car at that time. There wasn't any damage - and it was all good from ACE's side as well - but I was just a little uneasy about getting on that shuttle-bus without final sign off on acknowledgement of condition of car on return. Summary though - fantastic value for money - seriously consider ACE rental cars if you don't need the latest model - my view is that the 3 to 5 year old cars have been run in - and should have less chance of breaking down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T08:58:08.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The home-owners prepared a detailed information pack for me before they left; their home is a lovely, modern, well-equipped, well-maintained property with beautiful countryside views and friendly, helpful neighbours; and their cat is a sociable, undemanding companion who it was a pleasure to share the house-sit with. I stayed in regular contact with the home-owners throughout the two months via email, which I think worked very well for us both, without feeling excessive. I highly recommend this house-sit to others and would be delighted to house-sit there again in the future, if our timings coincide again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:33:36.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The website is very user-friendly, and the staff is helpful if you need extra assistance. I have had one of their decals on my kayak for over 2 years, and it's still sticking great, despite hundreds of hours of sunset and lake water. Very, very impressed with this company and the vinyl lettering they produce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:30:31.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

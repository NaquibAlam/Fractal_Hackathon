Everything was as expected. I was very impressed with the look and feel of the seats. We special ordered and knew that it was going to take 2-3 months to receive our entertainment seats. The Lighting and extra White Glove and Warranty is worth it for me.\nWe had two issues with an extension cord and a bracket, but Richard (our rep) was very helpful and is sending out to us immediately.\nI am very happy with the purchase and the Customer Service.\nTami", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:06:34.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

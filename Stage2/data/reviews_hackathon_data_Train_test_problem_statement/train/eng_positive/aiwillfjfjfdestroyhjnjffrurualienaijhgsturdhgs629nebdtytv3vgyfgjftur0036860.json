Their advice and sound judgement (actually Kirsty's advice and judgement!) made the rental experience easy and stress free. Nelson Alexander (Brunswick) were responsive and proactive.\nOn the basis of the quality service we received we decided to use Nelson Alexander to sell the property. We couldn't be happier with the service, advice and professionalism of Peter Jones. He was upfront and gave us sound advice on how best to sell the property. A couple of times we pushed back on the advice and once he explained the rationale, we subsequently took the advice - particularly around the timing of the auction, how to present the property, how to deal with the 'tyre kickers', how to deal with difficult parties. In the end, Peter's advice was spot on and exceptionally helpful in achieving the optimum at auction.\nWe have owned several investment properties over the years and in our view, the team at Nelson Alexander (Brunswick) are simply the best.\nWe couldn't recommend Nelson Alexander more highly and the service and professionalism of Kirsty and Peter. Thank you Nelson Alexander!\nRichard & Liz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:00:47.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Their prices are great but what sold me was the 1st time I ordered. I had a computer glitch and called customer service. They straightened out my order and continued to provide knowledgeable information about my purchase. That's why I'm back! Other stores carry the same brands but how can you beat great prices and a superior customer service staff. Oh and the product ships fast!!

The package was also small enough to fit in the mailbox so i didn't have to be home. I ordered to the Netherlands so it is possible in the Eu. quality is good it's just like the snus i bought in the shop while i was in Norway. the price was good 5 euro's a can which is fair. so far no complaints. I will be ordering again and if anything comes up i'll edit my review. the site may look like a scam but its legit. some ratings said that their orders where stopt by customs but in holland its not that strict with the weed capital of the world. i get that it takes a while to deliver with it coming from israel but i was satisfied. sorry for my bad english but i am a 15 year old dutch kid so im not very good at english and i don't really care. last note on trust pilot many of the recent reviews where obviously fabricated but i don't know why they would do this because it works fine. good alternative to smoking. you should try it but not to large orders for if it gets stuck at customs it will suck.\nHello i'm back i have just recieved my second order in time and good condition so it still works still have had no trouble and my orders have both arrived in six says or less so still fine. Would recommend to people who want snus in the EU its a Good alternative to smoking. Its also niveau that they mail it in boxes but in envelopes so it fits in the mailbox bye for now ill update if anything goes wrong", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:50:55.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Was very excited to see what you guys sent . I was pleasantly surprised to see the quality of goodies inside . Trout style swim baits , jig heads , some plastics and gap hooks. All stuff I would use .\nI love here in Toronto Canada and getting these mystery boxes through the winter months definitely gets you excited for spring fishing ( I don't do much ice fishing ) . That being said hopefully the next mystery box for march /April will be geared towards spring fishing ... trout , perch etc...\nKeep up good work ... Looking forward to next package\nMarko", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:09:45.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

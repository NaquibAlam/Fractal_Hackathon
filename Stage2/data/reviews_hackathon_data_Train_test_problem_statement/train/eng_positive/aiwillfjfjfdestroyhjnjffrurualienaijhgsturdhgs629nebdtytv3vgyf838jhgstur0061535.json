I am a store mgr. & have been one for over 20 years I always put myself in the customer's shoes First when they enter into my establishment.. I train my team as well to do The same. It is very hard to shop on the opposite side as a customer when I am outside of work to find that same treatment.That is why I am taking the time to do this survey.. Josh and his Team went above & beyond he actually took the time to listen & understand what exactly we needed & explained the benefits along with keeping us in the price point we needed to be..All this while helping his team. So I thank you for the easy and wonderful experience....", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:18:07.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

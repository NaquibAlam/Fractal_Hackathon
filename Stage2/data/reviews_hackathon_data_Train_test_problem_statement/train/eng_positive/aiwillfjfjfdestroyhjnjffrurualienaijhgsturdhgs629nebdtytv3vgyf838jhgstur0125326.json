Found one in my area who has been back to fix my DIY projects that I botched. lol\n2nd time was for insulation. We decided not to do this.\n3rd and most recent time was for someone to come in and re-stretch a rug. I was thrilled to see that there are people who do this and this project was completed quickly.\nMy only word of 'caution'....once you type in your phone#, you can receive multiple calls in seconds! It is so refreshing to have people eager to work instead of leaving messages that are never returned or am told the job is too small.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T22:49:42.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

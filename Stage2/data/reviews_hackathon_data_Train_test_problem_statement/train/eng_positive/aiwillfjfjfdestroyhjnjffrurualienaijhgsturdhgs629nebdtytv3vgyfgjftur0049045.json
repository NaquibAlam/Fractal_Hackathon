This gave Wesley International about 48 hours to put this all together and get the units on a truck - and somehow they made it happen!\nOn top of that (we now own 5 Pack Mules) and our people LOVE them! I wish I had known/bought these years ago. They make life easier and SAFER for our staff, and no doubt, more efficient - which our Customers love!\nSpecial Thanks to Gregory Boone and the rest at Wesley that made it all happen exactly as I needed it to!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T22:02:54.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

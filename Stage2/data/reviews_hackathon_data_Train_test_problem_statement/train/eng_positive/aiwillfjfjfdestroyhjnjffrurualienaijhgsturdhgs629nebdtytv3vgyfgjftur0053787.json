I also sleep in between a couple of children and that meant sagging between the two chambers. Purchased a single queen air chamber and pump from InnoMax. Both seem to be good quality and I prefer the single chamber/ The bed is much more stable and doesn't sag in the middle. Their basic pump is pretty quiet compared to my previous pump but takes a lot longer to inflate the bed. Not an issue once fully inflated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:23:55.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

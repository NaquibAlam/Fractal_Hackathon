Unfortunately Google Voice does not support text over e-mail. Since this was going to be personal, low-volume texting, I wanted something that I didn't have to spend a lot of money on. SMSGlobal made this quite easy and affordable. I was looking at another well-known service, but they wanted a $30 up-front setup charge in addition to the per-text charges. SMSGlobal has no up-front setup charge, so I was able to get started with $5. Their API is very simple, easy to use, and is supported by most applications. I am using it with Paessler's PRTG monitoring software to send alerts when my router has problems. It is working out Great! I am very happy with SMSGlobal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T05:32:48.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

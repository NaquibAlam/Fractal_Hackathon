Unfortunately, I did not go through with the order as the cost to ship overseas was more expensive than the order total. I wish you had more shipping options available instead of just UPS worldwide expedited. Im in no rush for the order but the shipping on two frames was $250, considerably more than the order total. I was very disappointed. Would love a no frills shipping option.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:14:39.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

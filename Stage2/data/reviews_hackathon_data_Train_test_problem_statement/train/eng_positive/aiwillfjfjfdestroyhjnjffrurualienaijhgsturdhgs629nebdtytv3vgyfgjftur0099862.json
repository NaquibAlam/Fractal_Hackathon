I couple of years ago I had ordered pre-loaded flash drives shaped like a key from Flashbay. They provided excellent products at a low competitive price. I contacted them again this for a quick Quote: on a swivel, colored, 2GB drive. The Quote: came back so quick - I ordered that same day. The turn around was in a week for our flash drives. Monica Pavliga, our Account Manager, provided excellent customer service and sent me proofs in less than a day. She was awesome to work with and I would highly recommend her to anyone interested in ordering products from Flashbay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T22:28:26.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Cody remained calm when everyone else was in a panic. Today the buyer happily signed escrow documents 6 days ahead of schedule! Woo-Hoo!\nI cannot express my thanks loud enough for Cody Smith. He is awesome. I will definitely refer my clients to him. He deserves much more than 5 stars :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:14:54.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

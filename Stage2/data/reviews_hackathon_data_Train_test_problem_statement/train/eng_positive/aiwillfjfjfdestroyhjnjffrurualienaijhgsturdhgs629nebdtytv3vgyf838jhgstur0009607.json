I went on Erik's web page, and a TOPEAK Joe Blow Fat Tire Pump, I ordered it, and within a couple days it was at my house. While on line ordering the pump, I noticed a membership application to Erik's Bike Club, I'd been a pretty regular customer in the years I lived in Farmington, always good folks to work with when it came to bicycles. Then too Erik has done much for those of us that ride the various tours, and organized rides, his mechanics have tweaked my bikes a few times, no charge. So the next time I was in Rochester I stopped in at ERIK'S, and the sales manager Casey Coughlin helped me finish the paper work, and now I'm in the club.

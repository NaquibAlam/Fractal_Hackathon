I have had 4 Kias before but there were other features in the other two makes that I did like too. As all the cars were pretty even price wise I decided to let my instinct decide. I went to three different car yards and Motorama Kia was the last. Talk about chalk and cheese... the moment I walked in the doog a salesman walked straight up to me and I expected the sales spiel to start, but rather I got a pleasant greeting and he starting questions to narrow down what I wanted there was no hard sell like the other two car yards and they seemed to anticipate my questions and answered them before I asked them. I told them my budget and not once did they show me a car that was over my budget. In fact they asked why I wasn't considering the larger Kia model than the Rio that I was looking at and when I told him that my decision was based purely on my budget, he suggested the Cerato. At first I thought this was the up-sell to get me to consider a car just over my budget, but I was wrong and they had a special on the Cerato which made it also within my budget. This was about the 5th new car that I have purchased in my lifetime and it was by far the smoothest and most professional negotiation and transaction of then all. I highly recommend Jordan (Sales) and Chris (Finance) at Motorama Moorooka Kia for a thoroughly professional process when even a last minute change of mind to go from a hatch to a sedan wasn't questioned and the paperwork was changed in 5 minutes.\nI walked away with the car I wanted in the color I wanted with the features I wanted and I can't believe that I'm saying this, but dealing with the staff there was an absolute pleasure. No rehearsed sales pitch, no pressure and just a great bunch of professionals who know their jobs and who just want to give you the best deal that they can.\nI'm one very happy customer!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T05:59:45.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was a Standard Nielsen 11 gold metal frame. Over the years I have framed my college diplomas, various other documents and acquired 7 more professional licenses, all framed with the same style Nielsen frame. The latest license was framed just last month and American Frame still carries that same style gold Nielsen frame that I bought 28 years ago at the best price around and with quick shipping. When I need another document frame, I will be back to American Frame.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:08:17.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

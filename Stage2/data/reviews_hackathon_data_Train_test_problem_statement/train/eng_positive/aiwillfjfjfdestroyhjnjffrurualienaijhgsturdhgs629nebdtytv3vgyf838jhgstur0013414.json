The question to ourselves was:\n1). How do you get caught up on several years unfiled returns;\n2). What is our total tax burden to both IRS & State authorities?\n3). How will we recover from potential tax liability of approximately $40K?\n4). Will the IRS freeze our bank accounts; seize our cars & home? and\n5) How can we stop State garnishments that were being assessed on an individual basis?\nWe delayed (push back) filing annual returns thinking we owed a lot of money. With each additional year the matter was compounded & the fear factor increased. What triggered us to ACT, was constantly hearing/seeing commercials (cable, radio and television) promoting OTR as the solution to dealing with IRS and ultimately protecting their clients through resolution. We felt the powers above was talking to us directly, because every time the advertisement started airing, we would switch channel only to hear add again shortly thereafter. This made us spring into action ---- retained OTR to help us.\nBy far this was one of the best decisions we've made - quite costly - but money WELL spent!! During each phase of the process, the Optima team communicated precisely what would occur, next steps and possible outcome. They represented us professionally and the final disposition in this matter showed our predicament (tax liability owed to IRS & State) was not as bad as we thought.\nKudos to the entire Optima Tax Relief team who resolved this matter for us. To reiterate, the cost seemed excessive but having OTR serve as an \"insurance card\" in our back pockets was well worth the \"price of admission!!\" Now that we are back on track, we enjoy total peace of mind knowing our tax resolution was handled by professionals, and have vowed never to end up in this situation again. One thing is certain, we would not hesitate to recommend OTR to our families, friends &/or anyone we encounter, and will readily offer up testimonials if asked to do so.\nWe intend to utilize OTR's Tax Preparation Service to prepare 2016 returns - both Federal & State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:59:42.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Rental issues were clearly delineated in the contract and payments hit the credit card on-time or late (better for me!), We had only one small issue and it was addressed quickly. I like the safety of renting through an organization rather than VRBO (my sister has had 2 cancellations of her rental less than a week before her vacation start date). I also like the way pick up and drop off of the keys is handled - makes it easier if we are running late since we drive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:55:06.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

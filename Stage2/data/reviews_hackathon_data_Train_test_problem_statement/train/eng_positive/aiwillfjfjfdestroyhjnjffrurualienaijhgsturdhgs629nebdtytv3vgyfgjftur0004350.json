I chose it because it is compact, uses no salt or electricity and requires no flushing. I live in a townhouse, so I didn't want to use up too much space.\nCustomer Support (Rob) is extremely helpful. I had some difficulty with installation, and I'd encourage you to hire a plumber or handyman. I've done a lot of my own plumbing, but my water shut-off (where the feed is) was installed sloppily so it made it difficult to install the equipment. Once I reviewed the installation with customer support, I had my handyman complete the installation (as well as improve the water feed).\nThe water is smooth and absolutely tasteless. There's no sticky feeling after washing my hands or after hand washing glassware. I'm looking forward to a load of laundry and a shower!\nThis EZ-Connect Compact Water Filter/Softener Combo system, while more expensive than traditional bulky salt softeners is well worth the investment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:34:26.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

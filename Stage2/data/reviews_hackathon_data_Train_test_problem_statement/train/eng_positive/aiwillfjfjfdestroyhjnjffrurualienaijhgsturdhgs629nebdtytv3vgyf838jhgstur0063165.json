The only remarks I would make about is the following.\nThe only payment option available to Brazil is \"boleto\", which:\n- causes a bit of delay in transferring (because it is payed in a bank, then it take 1-2days for the payment to be settled (meaning, the money arrives at Transferwise in 1-2 days, not realtime));\n- created an inconsistent status when I accidentally cancelled an order for which the \"boleto\" was already issued, which the system identified as a \"pending transaction\", temporarily taking some of the monthly transfer limit (until the \"boleto\" due date).\nIt would be nice to have credit/debit card transfer options, as well as bank transfer options, which could also speed up transfers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:34:14.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

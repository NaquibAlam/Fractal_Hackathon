I don't cook things like casserole or vegetables, just really simple things, this will be ok for us with what we need it for. Glad it has other options though, child lock, pre cook settings, it has a timer to automatically start cooking say a casserole which my other one never had. Mind you my old one was a Sharp & I had it for over 16 years, so that's why I went with the same make, reliable, not very pricey, stylish, just wish I had a bigger kitchen to have it on display, shame to hide it. I love it so far so good let's hope it lives up to my other one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:04:46.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

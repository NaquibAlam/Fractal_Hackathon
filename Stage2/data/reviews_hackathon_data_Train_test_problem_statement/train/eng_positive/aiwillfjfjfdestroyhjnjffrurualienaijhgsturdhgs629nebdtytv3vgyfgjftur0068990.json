I had never ordered from them before, but at less than half the price of the motor from a local auto parts store, I was willing to take a chance.\nI half expected a cheaply made part or the wrong part as often is the case with some on-line stores. I was pleasantly surprised that the part came in a reasonable amount of time, the part was correct and appeared to be as good as the original. It also was well packed an had no transit damage.\nIt installed without any fit problems and worked like new.\nI do not order a lot of car parts, but I will order from StockwiseAuto again when the need arises. As a former business owner, I like a company that provides good service as that seems to be the exception rather than the rule in todays world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T22:06:49.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

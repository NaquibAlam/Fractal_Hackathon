Phil was knowledgeable about the local history and threw in some wonderful facts along the way. He also showed us some other things to do in Singapore as regular tourists, like the cable ride to Sentosa. All of the WW 2 sites in Singapore cannot be seen in a half day, of course, and I was very glad to see some of the more offbeat sites as well. He dropped us off at Battlebox at the end of the tour.

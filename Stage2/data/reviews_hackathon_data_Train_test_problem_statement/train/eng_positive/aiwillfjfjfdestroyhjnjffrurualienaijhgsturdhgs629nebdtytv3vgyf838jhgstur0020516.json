What made my experience so positive was that in addition to competitive pricing, the engraving proof the designers sent showed that the CrystalPlus people really want their customers to be satisfied with the final product. It felt like a personal shopping experience, even though it was all done online. I haven't had this kind of shopping experience online before. 5 stars to prices, products, and service.

Now imagine that same water leak that results from a broken pipe over an electroplating tank and overflowing it just after everyone has left for a three day weekend, forgetting to turn off the main water valve!! You can forget just costing you money... think \"door closing event\" with the possibility of thousands of gallons of hazardous solution eventually making its way out of the building!! The minute I saw this product on the market I was on board. This unit has operated in full off mode and away modes daily since December of 2008. This constitutes a minimum of 5 full revolutions of the gate valve and motor daily, 6 days a week. That's approximately 1,560 cycles/yr and 12,480 cycles since installed!!!

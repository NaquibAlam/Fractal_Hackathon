I would prefer receiving them in a box, so the carrier could not fold it. I was lucky that they were still usable.\nAdditional to that the boxes that I bought have a window and they send the poly sheet separately. It is very hard to glue them to the boxes since the boxes are already assembled. I wish they give an option whether you want the poly sheet assembled or not. However, they have free sample offer, I suggest to use that before you order something. I got samples for another box and thought that I don't need to order this one as a sample because the quality of the boxes was really good.\nBesides those, the quality is really good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:49:17.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

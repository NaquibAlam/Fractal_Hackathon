From the get go, we have received nothing but exemplary, caring and professional services from the front office team, management and Servcorp support staffer.

I have worked with two of the dedicated personal assistants that impressed my customers, and even helped to win sales through their confidence, personality and overall style.\nServcorp Docklands is a small business environment, yet they have done their best consistently above any larger serviced office organizations.\nOur company owed them the gratitude for what we have accomplished, and looked forward to a successful partnership with Servcorp Docklands.\nWe would have incurred huge expenses trying to set up a similar business structure, quality professional services and experiences for our customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:11:58.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

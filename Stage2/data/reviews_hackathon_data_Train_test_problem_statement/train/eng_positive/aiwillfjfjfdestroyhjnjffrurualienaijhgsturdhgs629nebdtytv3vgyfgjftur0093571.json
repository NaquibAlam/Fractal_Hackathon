Ed personally contacted me to help figure out details to ship 5 motorcycles from Iowa to Alaska. This can't be done in one step because travel from the contiguous 48 states into Alaska is considered an international transit (must go through Canada). Ed worked with me to explain the need to have a second party involved (barge service from Seattle to Anchorage). Ed took the time to work with us on getting our bikes from Iowa to Seattle, WA or Hawthorne, CA. The shipping fee on his end was very fair. I will be using Motorcycle Shippers for ALL my motorcycle transfer needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:50:19.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

She explained everything in detail and continually asked if I was okay along the way. Even though the hair removal is a little bit painful (especially in some spots), Jessica kept talking to me to keep my mind off of it. Vanessa the receptionist is also very wonderful. She explains the whole process in detail and puts you very much at ease. It is totally worth putting up with a little bit of uncomfortableness to know in the near future that my hair will be gone.

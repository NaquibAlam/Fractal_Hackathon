I placed an order which was for a gift for a friend I'm visiting overseas and was worried that it wouldn't get to me on time before my flight. I sent an email asking for special consideration. Within 30 minutes I got a response via email saying that they would have it despatched the next morning, I then received a phone call the next day to update me on the status of the despatch so I would have peace of mind. They went above and beyond and I received my order heaps quicker than expected.

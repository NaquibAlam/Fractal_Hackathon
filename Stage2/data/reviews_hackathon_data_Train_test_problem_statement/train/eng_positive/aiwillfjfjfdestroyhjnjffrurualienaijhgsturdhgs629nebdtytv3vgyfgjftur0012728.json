As I was in transition in Bangkok I need some cheap and nice place for 2 days. And searching on internet i found best location for me. Then I found Amoma cheap price for 4 stars hotel, but it was too good to be true. So I've start checking on site and read a lot of bed and good reviews at the end convinience in price and location took over me and I've booked with Amoma. After few days I notice that I've made mistake on beds so I've write directly to hotel and they confirmed my booking and my request. It was fabulous place for money. Well done Amoma. Thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:48:36.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I swapped out my old alarm system but bought most of my alarm components from \"the other guy\" before I came upon Alarm Grid. I didn't compare prices of what I bought but if Alarm Grid was 15% or even 20% higher it makes sense to buy the alarm components from Alarm Grid, and here is why: in three words - amazing customer service. I felt guilty telling their tech support people that I bought my stuff elsewhere but they didn't care, they would have liked for me have bought my stuff from them but it didn't stop them from giving me world class technical support. So I bought my communicator from them and going forward I will buy any additional components from them.\nAs to setting up my communicator, nothing could be easier than they made it. I installed the communicator and then signed up for their Gold monitoring package. Within a few hours of signing up Joe from Alarm Grid called me to do the setup. I was concerned about all of the programming I was going to have to do to get it set up. My fear of doing all of that programming evaporated quickly with Joe on the phone. He did all of the programming remotely while I sat and watched. I had questions as he was doing the setup and he addressed every one of them as well as giving me a tutorial on using the system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:52:28.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We are so glad we found Spotahome! We looked at other agencies that offered 3 month rentals but either their web sites weren't user friendly, they didn't respond to our emails or their expectations weren't a good match.\nSpotahome had a user friendly web site. We loved the You Tube videos that showed details like inside the kitchen drawers and view from the verandas. The agents responded promptly and gave us updates during the process of obtaining approval from the owner. They also were creative while obtaining approval from our bank to complete an unusual online transaction. It was very nice working with individuals who spoke English. This helped us avoid problems with written translations and potential misunderstandings. Great experience so far! We will provide more feedback once we arrive in Spain and complete the rental transaction.\nJackie Dinge and John Price", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T16:21:31.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I stumbled upon wholelattelove on YouTube and took a chance on this Brerra. Trust me when I tell you, it is night and day when you grind your beans vs pods. The milk frothed is amazing and I am not trying to master coffee art. Another huge benefit is the cost savings when buying fresh coffee beans vs pods. You are almost getting 6 cups of coffee for the price of one pod. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for something nice at an affordable price. Wholelattelove did a great job of educating me with their video's and delivered on time with a competitive price.

I read both good and bad reviews and decided to give them a try as they had good prices. I was not charged a shipping fee as I found a promo for free shipping. However, I was charged a processing fee which, in my opinion, was quite pricey. The order came in a very timely fashion. I am not sure if I will use them again as I heard once you re-order, the prices go up. We shall see.\nSo far, so good if it wasn't for the processing fee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:53:19.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

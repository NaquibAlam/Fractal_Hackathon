Zchocolat emailed to say goods shipped. DHL courier sent a text to say chocs will be delivered on Feb 15. One day late! I wrote to zchocolat to inform them about the text. Zchocolat made daily effort to check the status of the parcel at DHL and emailed to notify me that the parcel will be delivered on Feb 14. Actually the parcel was delivered on Feb 13. Thank you so much zchocolat for your excellent customer service!

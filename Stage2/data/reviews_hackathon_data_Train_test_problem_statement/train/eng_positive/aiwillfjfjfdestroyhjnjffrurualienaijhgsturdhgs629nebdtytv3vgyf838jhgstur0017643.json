Choosing was difficult, because there are so many beautiful dresses. The price was less than 1/2 of what the stores around my area charge for the same type of dress and the quality is equal (if not superior) to any of the dresses I could have bought in the stores. Another bonus is that this dress is very unique, so hopefully no one will have anything like my daughter! :)\nI would definitely recommend this company for any formal needs! The dress was true to size and absolutely stunning in person. I was not nearly as crazy about the dress when I saw the picture of it, but my daughter was sold on it. I am so glad she talked me in to it, because it is absolutely perfect for her!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:54:42.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

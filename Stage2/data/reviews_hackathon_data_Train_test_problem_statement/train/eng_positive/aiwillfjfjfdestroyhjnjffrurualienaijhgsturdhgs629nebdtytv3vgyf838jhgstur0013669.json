I didn't bail on my taxes or anything like that -- the IRS just didn't accept quite a few medical deductions I made because I was quite ill.\nThe total amount I owed was over $30K. Beyond anything I could have ever paid.\nI knew I had to do something and there are a lot of companies out there claiming they can help you pay off your taxes for a fraction of what you owe. Many are scams -- OPTIMA IS THE REAL DEAL! THE REAL REAL DEAL!\nThey worked with me for a year -- beyond professional, explaining everything very very clearly each step of the way, worked out a plan for me -- meaning, they chose the best path to approaching the IRS given my circumstances. It was a long process but one I always -- ALWAYS -- felt was leading to something special - a very positive outcome.\nSo how well did they do?\nMy $30K+ bill was settled for $100 Seriously, $100! I couldn't believe it. I burst into tears of relief and gratitude and called my adviser immediately even though I was all the way in Cambodia! I kind of thought it was a misprint but the documentation came directly from the IRS and I sent off my check and I am done! All settled and the lien they put on me will be lifted sometime by 3/15/17.\nI cannot say enough about how amazing Optima Tax Relief is! If you need help (I would advise if your bill is over $10K) you really need to call them!\nThank you to the whole Optima Tax Team and I hope this review helps anyone who is on the fence make the right decision and go with Optima Tax Relief.\nEmily A,\nNew York City", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:04:34.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

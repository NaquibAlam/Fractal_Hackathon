The doctors provide knowledgeable and compassionate care regardless of the stage of the animal's life. The doctors call the following day to check on the pet's status following an emergency or surgical procedures. The continuity of care is impressive.\nYou're greeted by pleasant office staff (also animal lovers). Scheduling is timed so there is little or no wait time and the facility is very clean. The vet assistants are efficient and thorough.\nI couldn't be happier with the care afforded my pet and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this veterinary practice to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:33:54.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

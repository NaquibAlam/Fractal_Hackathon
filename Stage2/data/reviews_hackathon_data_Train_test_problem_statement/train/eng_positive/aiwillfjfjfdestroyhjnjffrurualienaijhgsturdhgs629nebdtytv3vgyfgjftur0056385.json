After reading the additional hints and comments, I almost accepted each of the proposed wording. The editor was also able to explain in a very clear and understandable way why she proposed the changes and I learned a lot. Although a lot of editing was necessary, the editor has tried to maintain my own style of writing. I received the feedback even a few days before the scheduled deadline. I am very happe that I decided to have my dissertaion proofread and edited by Scribbr! Every cent was was well spent.

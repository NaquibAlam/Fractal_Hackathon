Now that i have more options i still like to fly with them if the price is convenient.\nAttendants are always very kind, elegant and never rude. Young and professional.\nFor sure the customer office online is one of the best I ever tried. Flying more than 20/times/year with them it happens something goes wrong: they are fast, kind and super efficient.

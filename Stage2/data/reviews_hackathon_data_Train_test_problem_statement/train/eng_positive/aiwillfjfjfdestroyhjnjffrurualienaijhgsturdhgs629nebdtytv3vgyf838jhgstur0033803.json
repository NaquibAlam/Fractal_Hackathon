Damian, the last of 5 agents we met, made a very big impression on us. We had previously read his profile on the internet and watched him call an auction video, but meeting him in person validated for us that he was genuine, honest, friendly, well spoken, experienced and extremely professional. These were keen attributes we were looking for and really wanted in an agent, when it came to representing our most prized possession.\nAlong the process of selling our home and during the marketing campaign, Damian was trustworthy, understanding and compassionate with our situation. He was a great communicator, reliable and always willing to give us the right advice and guidance we needed, to ensure our property achieved the best result on auction day.\nDamian was totally in his element on auction day! He runs on pure adrenaline, and thrives on the pressure. He thoroughly explained to us the auction procedure, and was determined to sell our house at a great price, which assured us that he truly cared for us and that we really were in good hands. His passion, zeal and genuine love for real estate really shone through that day, giving our home that X factor it needed to achieve a record price. We still can’t believe that when the hammer fell, Damian had sold our home for $125,000 over the reserve!! Damian shared our joy, and seeing him become emotional after the auction, only confirmed what we had felt along the way, that he had a good heart.\nIf you’re thinking of selling, we highly recommend you call Damian Ponte, as we are truly happy we met him and experienced his professional service and assistance in selling our home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T09:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T05:30:39.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

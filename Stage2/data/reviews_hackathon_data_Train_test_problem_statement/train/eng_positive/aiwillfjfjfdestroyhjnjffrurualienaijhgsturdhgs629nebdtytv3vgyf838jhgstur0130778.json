They are really good and useful. I had tools and routers and other such bits and pieces in odd boxes and bags. I bought 5 of these units and use all of them. They come in sets of three, and three sizes. They come with a wheeled base, which has two brakes the base also separates. All the units interlock with each other via four snap fit clips, and you obtain really good stability. The thing I liked was you are able to stack up to six box high, with out compromising stability. Packed well, delivered by Parcel Force in good condition and in good time. Rutlands is a good place to go, would thoroughly recommend this company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:37:53.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

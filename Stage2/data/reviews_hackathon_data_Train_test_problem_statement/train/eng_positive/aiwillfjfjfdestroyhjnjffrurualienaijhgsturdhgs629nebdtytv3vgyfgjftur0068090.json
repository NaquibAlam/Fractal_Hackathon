I tried CVS, AAA, post office and none of them could help. I searched online and found mypassportphotos.com. I requested photo specialist service to make sure all the requirements are met. During the process, I used online chat service to address my concern and check order status and send in more photos as the first one I submitted was not in compliant. Their responses were always quick and helpful. They are patient, knowledgeable and efficient. Also I like the fact that they can send prints to local Walmart, CVS, etc. for pick up. When I found out that Walmart printed my photos on semi-gloss paper not gloss paper (yeh, that particular), I contacted the company. They re-send the order to CVS to reprint. I was so happy with it.

After having lost a beloved pet to cancer and having experienced the associated veterinarian bills with it, we thought that it would be beneficial to have Pet Insurance, but we had Pet Insurance from a competitor in the past and found that the competitor was very costly and coverage was relatively limited, additionally, the competitor did not offer insurance for elderly pets. Along comes Pets Best. Not only did they offer coverage for elderly pets, but their rates are reasonable. The response to claims is very fast, and you receive a clear explanation of benefits as well. The benefits definitely help offset the veterinarian bills, too. I have and I would and I will recommend Pets Best to any pet parent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:27:41.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

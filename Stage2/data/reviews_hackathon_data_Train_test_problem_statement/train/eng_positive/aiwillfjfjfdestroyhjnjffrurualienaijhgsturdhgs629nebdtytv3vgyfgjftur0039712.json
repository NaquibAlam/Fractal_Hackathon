Decided to try a Homestay, Judy had great reviews and they are well deserved. Nice welcome, large comfortable bedroom, great bathroom with nice shower. Took Judy's recommendation for a local restaurant Cafe du chat noir, good French food in Welsh (generous) portions.\nGreat weekend topped of by England winning the match!

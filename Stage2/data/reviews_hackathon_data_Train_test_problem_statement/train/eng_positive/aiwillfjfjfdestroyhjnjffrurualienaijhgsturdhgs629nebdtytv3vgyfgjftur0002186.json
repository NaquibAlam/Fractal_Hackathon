It has a great deal of interest, great color and finish, and was built with great workmanship in the mitering of the corners. I very much loved the price of the frame too: what a bargain! This is, I think, the best frame I've purchased from an online source...and I've tried 3 or 4 of them in the past few years. The only problem I had was very specific to my framing needs. I left a note (where indicated to do so) that I did NOT require any tolerance added to the exact frame dimensions I requested. This particular frame was for a mosaic....it needs to be glued and nailed to the existing backer board. Unfortunately, they added 1/8\" to each direction (as would be typical for almost every other use for a picture frame). This is unfortunate for me since it is VERY difficult to shim something 1/16\" on all sides. So, instead of enjoying my framed art already, I still have quite a bit of work to do. Still, I will definitely use American Frame again, but only for typical print artwork.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:57:45.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Wesley Chapel Toyota's Johnny Millaway was truly fantastic and from the first email from him, I saw something different than the responses I received from my other 5 local area dealers. I found him to be all about getting a customer what they want, not in the least attempting to simply \"sell a car & make a buck\". I drove an hour to get to this dealership because of the way they treated me and my family. Johnny had exceptional communication and actually read my emails, unlike the other 5 dealerships I dealt with. I had dealt with 5 other dealerships about this car and those five could have been quintuplets by the way they responded. I told my wife \"This fella Johnny Millaway from Wesley Chapel Toyota is way different than all of the other people getting back to me about the car\". I have a Toyota dealer 10 minutes from me, but WC Toyota has them beat by far. I know where to go next time and where to send others!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T20:26:28.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

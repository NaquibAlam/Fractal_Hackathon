The only negatives I would mention are that I found the membership details such as using a credit versus purchasing an item at a discount, confusing. Additionally, the shipping is very slow, and I wish they had more variety in the pants department, as almost all of the pants are tight, skinny style; while that is a style I enjoy, I play disc golf often and wish there were more options for that type of exercise (e.g, Adidas-style pants that are warm for outdoor activities, maybe a lightweight waterproof pant, and/or pants with a wider bottom). I do enjoy fabletics overall and would recommend them to a friend!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:23:13.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

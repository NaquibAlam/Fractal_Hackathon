Not only did I save thousands of dollars on a Real Estate agent but the way buy my place is set up meant, I still got all the same services.\nI had a professional write my advertisement. It was very compelling.\nThen a professional photographer came and took photos that really showcased our property in the best light.\nThey supplied a For Sale board and small \"Open for inspection\" boards.\nThe property was then listed on all the major real estate sites like realestate.com.au and domain.com.au\nThe leads came just to us. It was really easy talking to the prospective buyers. We elected not to have open houses as we wanted to control the process ourselves.\nThen when it came to offers, we could have organised for a \"buy my place\" person to do the negotiating. However we were comfortable to give it a shot and successfully negotiated our sale.\nOur sale was just as professional as having a real estate agent. I fact it was more professional. Real estate agents just bring anyone through. We were able to ensure the people who viewed our home were really looking for what we were selling.\nI highly recommend buy my place. You don't need any skills, just a passion for your own home. Buy my place will help with everything you can't manage and at a fraction of the cost of a Real Estate agennt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T16:59:08.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

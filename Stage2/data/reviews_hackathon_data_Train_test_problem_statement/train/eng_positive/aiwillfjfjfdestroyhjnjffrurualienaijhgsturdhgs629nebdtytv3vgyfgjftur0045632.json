Searched the web and found GoTravel. Did some research about the company to maje sure they were legitimate.\nWe booked a 27 day driving tour with GoTravel. This included arrangements for cars, transfers between north and south Island and hotels. The agent provided us several options. Everything went off without a hitch!! Very pleased with the agent \"Vered\". I had a few questions for her during the trip and she responded in no time!!! I would highly recommend GoTravel.\nJohanne", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:59:38.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

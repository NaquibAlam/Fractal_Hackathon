The prices are good and they carry a huge range of products. However I have found that if you have to have things delivered (I live 2 and a half hours away) it is not so cost effective and if the same product is available at my vet surgery it works out cheaper and faster to buy it there. Having items delivered by courier (the cheapest delivery option) takes a long time as I assume they are picked up at a particular time of day and if you miss that it's another day added to the wait time. Once it has been picked up from The Vet Shed it then has to go to another depot and wait for the next scheduled delivery to your area. Not ideal if you need a product quickly. I must add that the staff at The Vet Shed and the courier company are always very friendly and efficient.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T18:57:04.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There ended up being an issue with the seats we originally had. Fortunately, Tracy Parks and the rest of the support team we communicated with were able to work with us and secure great alternative seats. 3 of these tickets were even better than the original ones that had to be changed; at no extra cost! They really seemed to genuinely care about the issues we had and not only secured great tickets for us, they also gave us the additional piece of mind (which to a father sending his children into a concert while waiting in the car outside, was very special). Everyone had a great time! Thank you Tracy Parks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:44:02.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I loved free shipping with priority mail, I received a package 3 days later. When I open package and start to examine the parts, 4 of them look great, one look poor made, and another one is totally in doubt that has top cap pop up showing a gap with no sealant. I hope that packing staff should do a final visual check before shipping out, it would take a minute to do so because that is how long it took me.

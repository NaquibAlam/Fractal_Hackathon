While I was there, my family and I flew with Qantas from Sydney to Brisbane and Melbourne. On our flight from Melbourne to Sydney, we were supposed to take an A330-200, which is a wide-body aircraft, point being, it seated a lot of people. We were waiting by the gate to board our flight when we got the dreaded announcement that maintenance found an issue, which was a valve in the nose gear, presumably to do with the breaks was faulty and had to be replaced. We waited while they tried to fix it and lo and behold they can't and they have to move the aircraft into the hangar. At this point we got an announcement saying that the flight was cancelled and we could go to the customer service desk and re-book our flights back to Sydney. We were also to keep our boarding passes as they were now worth $30 to use at any shop for food, which was nice since there were four of us so we got a nice meal and several drinks at a more up-market restaurant with amazing views of the tarmac. The customer service at Melbourne worked really hard to make sure everyone with a connection at Sydney got there first, including a family who were taking a cruise - I believe Qantas got them tickets on a separate airline to get them there in time. When we were re-booked we were on a 737 and managed to get seats together a few hours after our original flight was supposed to leave.\nI am aware that other people have reviewed Qantas as bad and having poor customer support but I think they just had an unlucky experience. People are also more inclined to complain about a bad time than praise a good one which is why websites that don't ask you to use TrustPilot tend to get bad reviews. The only reason I give Qantas a 4 out of 5 is that they are usually too expensive to fly international and our second flight got moved back half an hour and we weren't notified about it until I looked on the information board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:04:48.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

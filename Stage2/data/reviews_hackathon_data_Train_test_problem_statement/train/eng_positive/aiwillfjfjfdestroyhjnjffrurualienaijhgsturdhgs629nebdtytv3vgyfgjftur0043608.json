Having grown up w/ Olympus and Nikon SLRs, I wanted to use dSLRs. Rhino delivered as promised before Xmas started. The ordering steps and payment options suited my needs, and went very smoothly. The set arrived and worked as expected. The first few days were to see how it all performs by shooting test pics and I noticed I needed higher performing lens. I contacted them and the representative has been very helpful to review my wishes and subsequently arranged for accepting the lens and I could select an alternative. The alternative had a lower price and he applied a credit as soon as we confirmed the balance due (he politely pointed out my error in calculating the difference). The replacement lens arrived few days later in a similar fashion like the complete kit. Nicely packed to protect it during the travel. Meanwhile the click counter is at 850: 850 satisfied shots. My 2 photographer buddies (one using Nikon D800, the other Canon 5D), and myself are looking at Rhino for our next purchase. Thanks for making this an pleasant purchase experience.\nRegards,\nEdward Tao\nAmateur aviation/scenery photographer of 33 yrs.\nQuality Manager at multinational", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T17:01:23.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

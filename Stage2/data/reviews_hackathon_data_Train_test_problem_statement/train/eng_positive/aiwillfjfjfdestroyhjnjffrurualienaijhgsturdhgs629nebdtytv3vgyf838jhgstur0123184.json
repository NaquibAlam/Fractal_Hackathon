And what a hot day it was already. On arriving at the Avis/Budget office there were two long queues into the office and I thought we were in for a long wait in the heat. Bottled water and cool drinks were being handed to those in the queue. Within a couple of minutes we were called by one of your staff and followed her through the main office to another building where we were taken to the desk and a very pleasant young lady sorted us out very quickly and efficiently. She said that we had a Toyota Etios but I said that I would prefer a Polo as requested in the booking.. Within minutes she confirmed a Polo was available and we were on our way.\nThe Polo was a super car for us and returning to the depot was quick, just a couple of minutes, and the staff were great", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T05:19:28.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

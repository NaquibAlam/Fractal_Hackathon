After around the 8+ hour mark of taking these I would feel really tired and bored so that is why I got the 300mg Hemp Oil from Endoca.\nBefore I go into detail about there Oil I would like to explain I use CBD for mild anxiety, slight depression, sleep problems and moods.\nAnd I have got to say CBD is the cure to all of these any many more problems out there.\nSo back to Endoca's Hemp Oil, I have started taking 5 drops of a morning with my capsules and no more throughout the day unless I feel anxious or anything, but now I also use another 5 drops of a night when the capsules wear of so when I go to sleep I still feel relaxed and at peace and will drift of to sleep easily.\nSo overall I would recommend this Oil to everyone, even if you don't have any physical or mental problems it can still make you feel very healthy on a daily basis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:41:00.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

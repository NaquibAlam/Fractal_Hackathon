From the outset the emails and communication were very impressive and clear. I was told the expected time to be between 12.59 and 14.59. At 13.00 I was informed by Steve that he would be here in 20 minutes. He duly was! Steve then did a wonderful job, explaining what he was doing, answering my questions. He not only changed the tyre but checked all the remaining tyres and reset the tyre pressure monitor. All without a feeling of being rushed or in a hurry...and all for what I would consider to be a very reasonable price. I would have no hesitation in recommending tyresonthedrive to anyone. I am grateful that RAC recommended them to me! A sincere thank you to Steve Hughes for his work on my behalf today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:36:14.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

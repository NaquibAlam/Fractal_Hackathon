The website is user friendly and it offers the best deals. I always find better deals on flighthub than on expedia for exemple. The only down side is that if you're not quick enough to purchase a trip, its price can increase at time of payement. The website then offers you to go ahead and book your trip based on the new price or redirects you to other flights or deals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:49:23.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

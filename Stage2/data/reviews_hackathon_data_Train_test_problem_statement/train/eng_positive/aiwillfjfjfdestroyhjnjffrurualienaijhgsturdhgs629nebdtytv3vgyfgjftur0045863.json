They are very professional people and most of all they are so easy to talk to about your financial situation and will show you how to improve it if you need it. I thought my credit was to bad to ask for a loan, that was the wrong assumption. They checked my score and showed me how to make it stronger. I closed on 02-13-2017. You can use your v.a. loan, it is yours and Veterans United will help you get it and use it. Thank you (VU)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:14:26.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

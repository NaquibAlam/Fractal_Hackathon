I take my workout apparel very seriously...Fabletics has got me covered on the workout side from the best leggings and capris to tops I also get complimented on and never get in the way of what I'm doing when I exercise.\nNow Fabletics totally has me covered at work! Sweaters, skirts, tops - all perfect for work with the same comfort as my coveted workout clothes.\nI always look forward to the first of the month for the new outfits they have online. I love the collections they feature each month. I also LOVE redeeming my rewards points, it's a total perk.\nI REALLY REALLY REALLY wish they would open an in-person store in the Bay Area, preferably in the Stoneridge Mall in Pleasanton. I see so many women in this area with Fabletics apparel - in the gym and on the street!\nAs a two-year Fabletics advocate, please make my dream come true...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T21:43:07.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

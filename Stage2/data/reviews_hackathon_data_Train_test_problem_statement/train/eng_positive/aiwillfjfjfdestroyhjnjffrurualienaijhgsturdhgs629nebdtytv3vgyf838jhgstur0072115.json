I have been very pleased with the quality. I think they are also reasonably priced. The second time I ordered I had an issue with my credit card being declined and soon found out my card number had been used by someone else the week prior. They were kind and held my order for me until I straightened out the situation. Everyone was very gracious on the phone and communication was great. I highly recommend them if you need antique lamp supplies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T17:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T11:07:04.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

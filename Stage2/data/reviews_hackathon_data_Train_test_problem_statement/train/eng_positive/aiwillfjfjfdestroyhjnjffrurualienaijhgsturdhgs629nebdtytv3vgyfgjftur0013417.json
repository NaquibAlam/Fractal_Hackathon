I truly didn't understand the cancelation policy and didn't expect to complete our job as soon as we did. Thank you for the prompt replies and resolving the issue at hand.\nThe Hampton Inn hotel stay in Sand Springs was great, but will never book through HotelsOne again. Customer Service on phone was unacceptable and read the cancelation policy directly off my booking and was hung up on twice by two different people.\nExact Policy below\nWe understand that sometimes your travel plans change. We do not charge a change or cancel fee. However, this property (Hampton Inn Tulsa-Sand Springs) imposes the following penalty to its customers that we are required to pass on: Cancellations or changes made after 11:59 PM ((GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada)) on Jan 1, 2017, or no-shows, are subject to a 1 Night Room & Tax penalty.\nshe said it was different. I had asked her to explain and send me the policy she was reading. She did and it was exactly the same as above.

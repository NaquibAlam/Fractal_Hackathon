When you go skiing it is very difficult to keep the inside and out pristine. They said I would have to get it rinsed if the outside was dirty and this is impossible to prevent even though I always take good care of vehicles. I have never had this with any other company despite hiring several times every year. Moreover it was covered in a fine dust when I collected the car! They should include normal cleaning costs in the upfront rate for the car eg 4/5 euros for the carwash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T05:24:40.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

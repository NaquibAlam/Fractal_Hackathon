When I looked up the website to order a print, I was very pleased to find more of the artists work and several options for sale with that piece of art, from canvas to phone cases. I would love to see mugs and other ceramics options added. After ordering the original piece I was looking for I also ordered another painting. I received both of them quickly and very well wrapped. They are beautiful and I plan to purchase more artwork through Fine Art America again for myself and for gifts. The quality is outstanding. What a great way to buy quality art at reasonable prices, and for the artists to share beautiful, inspiring art with the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:26:06.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My friend and I had been checking a bunch of sites for trips to Italy. Over the past couple of days we would see flights, go to book them and then when paying the price would jump. It was extremely frustrating. He was ready to just pay the higher amount and I told him to just give me 5 minutes.\nI jumped on a computer, typed in \"Cheap flights to Italy\" and your website was the second or third site listed. I clicked, entered my information and the first flight that you showed me were the exact times I was looking for and an amazing price. I selected and within 5-10 minutes I had our trip to Italy booked! I was so excited that it all worked out and that we got such a good deal. Couldn't be happier.

We picked India by process of elimination of international flights and dates we could travel, and didn't have a lot of time to research much more. After a few emails our trip was booked. And our trip coordinator did an amazing job taking our preferences and creating a great trip. We made the decision to have a private driver and guides for every city we visited, and I cannot overstate how important this was for our trip. Our driver Anil was maybe the best part of our trip. Ask for him! He was safe, respectful, and SUPER fun. We had great conversations on our drives with him. Our guides (one in each city) were very knowledgeable and were essential for us not wasting a huge amount of time waiting in line, trying to figure out what was going on. Our hotels were amazing, top notch accommodations. Our only challenge was really the cash situation in india, which was NOT a problem except we were forced to tip everyone in USD. Which clearly wasn't their preference, but our $83 per person didn't go as far as we wanted it to.

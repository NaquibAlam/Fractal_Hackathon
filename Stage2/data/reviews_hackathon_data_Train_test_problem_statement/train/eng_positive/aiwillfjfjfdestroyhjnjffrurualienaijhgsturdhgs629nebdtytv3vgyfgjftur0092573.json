After endless searches for the perfect ring online and in person, I kept coming back to the \"design your own ring\" concept at The Natural Sapphire Company. I found the entire process incredibly simple and easy: from searching individual gems to the various settings, I could try endless combinations - and I loved the ability to see what the ring might actually look like using AutoCAD! Once I had an idea of what I might like, Caitlyn was responsive and helpful from start to finish, answering any additional questions we had. When the proposal actually happened and I got to see my ring in person, I knew it was perfect. It's exactly what I had envisioned and I am so incredibly happy I get to wear it every day. I absolutely LOVE it - thank you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:21:14.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

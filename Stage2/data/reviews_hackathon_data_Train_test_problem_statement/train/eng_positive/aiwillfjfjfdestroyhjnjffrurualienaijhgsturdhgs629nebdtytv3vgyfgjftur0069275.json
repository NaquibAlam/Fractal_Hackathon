I wish there was a presta valve option; when I tried to use a presta inner tube it blew up twice. The rim seem to be under sized or at the low end of tolerance as the tire did not want to stay on to be seated. I bought a new rim with a presta hole, the tire fit this new rim like I am accustomed, not too loose. The hilltopper motor was not as strong as my friends e-bike but strong enough for my purposes, to give that boost when you hit that nasty climb or your legs are burning. The motor is strong enough to get you started even on an incline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T22:45:35.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

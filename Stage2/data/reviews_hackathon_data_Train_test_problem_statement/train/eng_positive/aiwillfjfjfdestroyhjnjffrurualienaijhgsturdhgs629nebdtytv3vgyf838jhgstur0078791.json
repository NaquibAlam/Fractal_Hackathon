I called eDreams and was eventually transferred to Nagore who was very nice to talk to. Nagore made me feel calm and took ownership of the call. She kindly looked into what could be done for me and contacted the airline. Because the airline was so busy Nagore offered to let me off the line (which I really appreciated as it was a long distance call) and said she would call me back once she had everything organised. Within half an hour she had rang me back to say she had arranged a full refund of the flights. I really appreciate the effort Nagore went through to help me and I found her very professional and easy to speak with on the phone. I'm delighted with the experience and will use eDreams again :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T21:47:09.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

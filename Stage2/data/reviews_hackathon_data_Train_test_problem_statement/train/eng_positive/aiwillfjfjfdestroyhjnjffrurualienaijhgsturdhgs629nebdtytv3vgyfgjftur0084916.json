Alex was excellent in helping me and advising me of the best options for my area and needs. I asked him a question that he did not know the answer to but was more than happy to find out for me. He in turn was glad I asked as he now knows the answer and can use that as a selling point for Belong.\nThe email updates are very helpful and it appears we may have our internet connection much sooner than expected!

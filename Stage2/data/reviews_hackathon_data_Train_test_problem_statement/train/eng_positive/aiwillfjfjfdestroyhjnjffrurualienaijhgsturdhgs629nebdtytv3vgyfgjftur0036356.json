Unfortunately, the transmission they sent started out on the wrong foot. There was a TSB from Ford that showed a forward speed sensor was eliminated in later years so the casing for the transmission they sent had nowhere to mount the sensor that came out of my old transmission. Good thing there was that TSB from Ford dated September 29, 1997 on how to remedy this situation. Once the trasmission was installed; however, it would not go into reverse. The shop tried everything the tech told them to try to no avail until they finally noticed there was fluid leaking around the reverse servo. Further investigation noted that the circlip was not seated properly. The shop removed and re-installed the servo and circlip and everything appears to be working fine, with me covering the extra labor cost to fix the problem. At least I didn't have to wait a week for them to send a whole new transmission. Seems to me that if they dyno tested each transmission for 30 minutes as they say then they would have caught a transmission that wouldn't go into reverse from the get-go though. It's up and running now with no residual problems after installation. Hopefully it'll last another 234K miles like the original one. 2/6 Well one thing I can say about Street Smart Transmission is customer service is #1!. They refunded my cost to have the repair cost and worked with auto shop to repair the defect. I believe they would have shipped a new transmission no questions asked if they couldn't have figured out the problem. I've given them an extra star and wouldn't hesitate to try them again. I guess anyone can have an accidental problem slip through, it's how you deal with it afterward that makes the difference. Thanks for resolving the issue so quickly!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:51:02.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

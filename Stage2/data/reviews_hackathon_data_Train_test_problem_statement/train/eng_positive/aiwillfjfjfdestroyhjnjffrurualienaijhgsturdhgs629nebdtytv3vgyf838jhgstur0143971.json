We did the ATV and the White Water rafting tours while staying Arenal Manoa. If you have never gone on an ATV tour I would highly recommend it. It was a great way to start our vacation. We had been on White Water rafting tours before, but everyone is a different experience and this one did not disappoint us.\nWhile at The Falls at Manual Antonio we did the National Park tour and ended our trip with the Mangrove Kayak tour. The Falls was such a neat place to stay. It is a smaller resort which we liked. One of the features is a small jungle area in the center of the resort which was home to many animals including White faced monkeys, tucanes, and iguanas.\nAll of our drivers and guides were fantastic. We couldn't have asked for more pleasant and knowledgeable people. Richard, who was our driver to Manuel Antonio, helped us take a side trip to Sarchi. Sarchi is a small town that is the home of the Ox Carts and provides a great opportunity to shop for local crafts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:51:59.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Boss had a shipping problem with their 60W tubes so they gave a good discount on the 100W tube. Well my machine arrived two weeks ago. I spent a week running electric and making room in my shop. Well this weekend I used the machine, I also have a CNC machine and use Vcarve. Vcarve works like a champ with Laserworks, I engraved everything, made leather key chains, glass gifts, wood gifts. My wife has so many idea’s pinned in Pinterest all I have to do is find the time.\nI made a wedding gift for a friend a wooden plague with my CNC transferred the air work to Laserworks and made two matching leather keys chains and engraved plate. Please don’t share the photo until the date has passed.\nMike told me, “If you are using a CNC machine you will understand how to run a laser.” Well it is very easy but I can see there is so much to learn so many possibilities.\nSo the bottom line, I was skeptical about purchasing my Boss Laser we started out slow. Now I am very happy they have delivered everything they promised and more. I feel the product is made well I only had to adjust my red laser and I was up and running. They have given as much time as I needed when I call for tech support. I would recommend Boss Laser.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:48:01.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

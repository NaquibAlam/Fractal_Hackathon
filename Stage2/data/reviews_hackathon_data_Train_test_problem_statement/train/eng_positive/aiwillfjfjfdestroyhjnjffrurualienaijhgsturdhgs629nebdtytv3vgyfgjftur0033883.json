The time and effort put into this fragrance is astonishing! Once i smelt it in a magazine I knew i needed to have it! Its metalic, woody/soapy essence is awesome! Dior also delivers your product with speed and fancy boxes that add to the care they put into making their customers happy! They also give you so many more sampler items in a package! I can honestly say, am always going to love dior pruducts because they always deliver amazing products!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:07:28.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

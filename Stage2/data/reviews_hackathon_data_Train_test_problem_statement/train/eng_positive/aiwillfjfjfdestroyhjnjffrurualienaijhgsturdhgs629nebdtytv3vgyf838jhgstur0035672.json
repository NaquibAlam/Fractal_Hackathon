The #1 reason why I book through FH is because they are partnered with Ebates.ca (a cashback program for online purchasing which I already do a lot of anyway) and thus, provide the most cashback in comparison to expedia or other travel sites.\nThe 2nd reason why I prefer to book through FH is because sometimes they will show results/options that don't appear in my other searches. For example, google may only show me 1 connecting flight for a trip but FH will show me a connecting flight that better suits my plans. Other than that the results should be relatively the same as other sites (ie. I will not see a lower or higher price on FH as compared to google).\nA couple of things that I personally dislike about their site is that when you go through the process of booking your flight, this stage/page is very busy -a section for seat selection which is an additional fee (however they can't gaurantee your seat will be reserved -so why would I want to be charged when there is no gaurantee on my seat selection?!?!), the travel insurance is defaulted to an option with the highest charge. You have to take the extra time to make sure you don't choose a seat or travel insurance option if you don't want to be charged extra for it. Appearance wise, this section just makes the page look complicated.\nOther than that, booking is a breeze and I reccommend setting up an account with FH prior to booking so that you have a history of all your bookings and can make changes if needed rather than relying on emails for your itinerary. Hope this feedback helps. Happy booking!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:31:47.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

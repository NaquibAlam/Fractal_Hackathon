The product was well packed.\nMy issue is that there isn't an option for cheaper/longer delivery ie $10 delivery and receive package within 5 working days. I was going to order more of the product I ordered, but didn't because the flat delivery rate of $20 was actually more expensive than the product itself.\nI will be buying more from AMR, their prices are very reasonable - just have to space the purchases out more so I can afford them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:52:14.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

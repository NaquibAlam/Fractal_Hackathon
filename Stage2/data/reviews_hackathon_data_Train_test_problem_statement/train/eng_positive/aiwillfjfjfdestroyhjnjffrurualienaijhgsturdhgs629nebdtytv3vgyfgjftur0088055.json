I'm a first time user of Boxymo.ie and first time customer with any insurance company for that matter. I messed up on my application and had to get my policy in order and I spoke to several agents who were very helpful and helped me through what was essentially a nightmare situation, the agents who assisted me (there were a few) were Joanne, Peter, Colin, Lauren and Mayreen (I hope I spelled it correctly) who called me today to fix everything and was so lovely to speak too. My policy is now as it should be and recommend you guys to everyone ;)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:59:38.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Easy to fix on the window and looks great. Also please with the quality. My only hang up is that we got black out option and the weight of the blind means the strings keep breaking so at the moment I cant pull the blind up. It's down permanently until we can find a home fix. I'm sure we will though and it wouldn't put me off buying from here again. I had bought a similar blind for my spare room from Laura Ashley that was Â£400 and I wouldn't be able to tell much difference in the quality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:09:00.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The EDU program they offer for college students like myself pays off *at times*. I wish they would offer a flat discount across the board for students, say 5% min except a few select fixed priced items.\nThis is my one negative part of my review, some of the EDU discounts are far too hard to find in some categories. However, this may be dependent on the manufacturer and their EDU programs.\nOther than not receiving a discount on every product (lol) it is hard to find any faults after shopping with B&H for at least 3 years. I have never needed to use their customer service, but have only read good things.\nPlan to be a life long customer unless something changes. Electrical Engineering will ensure my repeat purchases : )", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:16:15.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

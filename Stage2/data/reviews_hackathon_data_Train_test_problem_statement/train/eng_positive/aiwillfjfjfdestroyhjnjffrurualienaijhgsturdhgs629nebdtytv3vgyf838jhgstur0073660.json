I have recently started a small business and so when the sale was on, I ordered some postcards to send out with my orders but I made a mistake and put an incorrect web address!! Completely aware of my incompetence I got in touch with moo and asked if they would be kind enough to honour the sale price when I reordered. (Cheeky, I know!) Amber from moo got in touch with a promo code which was amazing, she was really friendly and didn't once judge me for my stupidity!! When I ordered the replacement postcards, the code covered the entire cost of the order and the shipping! I was so surprised and blown away by the kind gesture of goodwill (especially as this was all my fault in the first place)! Seriously Moo, you guys are great and I am so pleased you supported my small business in this way! Thanks so much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T10:27:25.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I then had to call your 24 hr service, where I did not have to wait too long (5 minutes) and was taken very well care of. The young man, Eddy, was able to take the insurance off and when I received my Email ticket, I was pleased to see the correct amount and trust that this amount will be on my credit card. Otherwise, I will see how the actual flight goes in June, 2017 but trust all will go well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:43:14.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

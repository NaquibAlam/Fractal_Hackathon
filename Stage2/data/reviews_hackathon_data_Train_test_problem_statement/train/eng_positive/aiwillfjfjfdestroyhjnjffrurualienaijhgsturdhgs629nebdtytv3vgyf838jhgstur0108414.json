He spent so much time with my mother and I, helping us pick out the perfect mattress set for me. He was patient, as the decision making process spanned a couple visits. He wasn't pushy and he seemed genuinely interested in helping me pick a mattress that would make me happy.\nFurthermore, I later called in to make a change to my order. Dean was not available, so the wonderful young woman who answered my call took my issue to her manager, who made the changes while I was still on the phone! Literally changed my order and issued a refund in like 3 minutes - no trip to the store necessary. And the part I really love - the young lady called me back about 10 minutes later to let me know that they could, in fact, fit me in for delivery that very evening. She set me up and I had my new bed waiting when I arrived home from work.\nBut it gets better. People do make mistakes, but it's how the mistake is handled that defines how good or bad it is. So in changing my order, the manager ( I assume) set me up with a queen size frame rather than a king. So when the distribution center received the order for delivery, they noticed that I had a king size set, but a queen frame. So he called me and confirmed that it should have been a king and made the change so that when they arrived at my home a couple hours later, they were fully able to get me set up to sleep in my new bed right away.\nGardner White has STELLER customer service and I do not know why I have been dealing with that other place that is more expensive with less than great service.\nI have 3 boys and they are rough on my furniture, but I know that when itâ€™s time to replace, which is coming up relatively soon, I will be returning to Dean/Gardner White.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:19:00.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

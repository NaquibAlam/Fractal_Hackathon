The storage locker located in a clean, climate controlled building was the answer. This building was the former Canadian Tire Store located about a mile from our house. I rented a 7x10x8 ft. Locker. A week later it is still only half full. I found it to be very clean and the people on the front desk were helpful. I would recommend this facility to anyone. We did just that and sold our house in 1 day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:00:54.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

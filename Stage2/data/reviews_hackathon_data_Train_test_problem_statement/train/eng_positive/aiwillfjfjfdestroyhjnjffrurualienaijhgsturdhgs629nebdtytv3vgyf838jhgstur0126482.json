I have had a few negative experiences in the past with ZipRecruiter being unable to figure out how the site works, and our representative Michael Harrison never returned our phone calls. I explained my frustration with Alec, and mentioned that I didn't know if the platform was even going to work out for us. At the end of our conversation, I am much more confident with ZipRecruiter's abilities and am glad that we have a subscription. If I would make any suggestion to ZipRecruiter at this time, it wouldn't be to add any features, but to look at moving Alec up to a position where he managed our account & others. He has a lot of knowledge, and was incredibly helpful & friendly in explaining all the features and upgrades. You would be incredibly fortunate to have him as a customer success manager, or sales member. I hope that you take this review seriously, and do something to improve your company with those employees that keep money coming in. If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 6176978115. Thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T05:17:28.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

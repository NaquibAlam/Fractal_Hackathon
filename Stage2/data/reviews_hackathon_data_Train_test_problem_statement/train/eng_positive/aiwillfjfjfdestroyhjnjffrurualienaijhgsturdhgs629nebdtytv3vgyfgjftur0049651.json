I own 4 beautiful pieces: 1 photograph and 3 paintings. Delivery was easy; all pieces arrived in perfect condition and in a very very timely manner. I love the window-of-opportunity to return the piece if is not what suits you. So far I have been fortunate. The thing about Saatchi is: what other vehicle gathers SOOOO many options into one marketplace? My go-to gallery in our area is lovely, but there are often times I cannot find what I am looking for. The searching tools on Saatchi are brilliant (they don't always work 100% for me, but in theory, brilliant).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:55:57.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

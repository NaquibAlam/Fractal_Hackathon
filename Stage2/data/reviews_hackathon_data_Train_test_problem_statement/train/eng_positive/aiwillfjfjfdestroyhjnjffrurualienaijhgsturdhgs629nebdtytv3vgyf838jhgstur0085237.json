I dealt exclusively with, Caitlyn, their senior gemologist and head of sales.\nShe was simply wonderful ! While I did select my own sapphires from their website she explained every question I had about them through emails and phone calls. She sent pictures of the sapphires resting on her fingers so that I would have an idea of their true size and appearance. I want to stress that I would not have purchased these sapphires without Caitlyn's advice. I received both yesterday and they are just stunning ! I couldn't be more pleased. They're so, so beautiful that I'm afraid to even touch them. Thank you for everything Caitlyn !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T16:12:28.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A part was offered to be sent out to me but by this time i had made arrnagemnets to replace the blind. Following this, a refund was offered and processed quickly.\nThe blind itself appeared of great quality and certainly looked like a true Black Out blind. Such a shame about the damage (which i assume was UPS' fault) and length of time for service to get in touch but my experince was overall good.\nI am not even slightly put off using Blinds2Go in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:40:02.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

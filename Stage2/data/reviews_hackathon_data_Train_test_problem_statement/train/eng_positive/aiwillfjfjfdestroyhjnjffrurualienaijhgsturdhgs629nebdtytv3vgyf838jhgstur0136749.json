We have used their offices in several Australian cities, as well as elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, and the level of service has been wonderfully consistent and professional everywhere. Staff are always friendly and helpful and the office facilities give us all that we need. We've run marketing events from their offices and their support of this has been wonderful - we have no hesitation in inviting customers and prospects to meetings and events that we hold at Servcorp.\nWe have a contract for a package of services with them and the value is very good, but as with any service provider you need to monitor your usage carefully, as extra charges can build up if you use facilities outside your package agreement. The Servcorp staff are obviously carefully selected for their competence, professionalism and positive attitude, but I believe Servcorp could benefit by giving some more attention to diversity in their recruitment process.\nIf you are looking for serviced offices in the Asia-Pacific region, we wholeheartedly recommend Servcorp.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T18:37:40.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

However, the pen stopped functioning after one use, and I immediately notified the service department. They were responsive and offered to send a new atomizer although I explained that I thought the problems was the battery and/or charger. There was a several week delay on receiving the new atomizer. I called VaporNation and was told that the service department had inexplicably cancelled the shipping order. The situation was remedied and I received the new atomizer shortly after my phone conversation. The new atomizer did not solve the problem, so I still have a non-functioning $100 vape pen. I have sent an email to the service department and not heard back. I'm done with this company and would neither recommend doing business with Vapornation nor buying the Dr. Drabber Aurora vape pen. The service department was nice, friendly and helpful, but it's nearly a month later, and I still don't have a working vape pen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:00:36.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

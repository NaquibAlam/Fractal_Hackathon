It was very easy to navigate the site, plus they had various themes and options to choose from for the design. Not only did my order turn out beautifully, but they also printed me extras just in case! Free of charge!\nThe product quality was amazing, glossy, professional and so durable.\nI would highly recommend using optimal print. They really love up to their name and I will be using them for all my printing needs.\nI believe from the time I ordered, I received my order in anout 2 days or so.

We have used their protection when our air conditioner failed; our in-wall oven burned out a filament; our dishwasher stopped cleaning; our toilet started leaking; our Polaris pool pump bearing went out; and most recently, our main pool pump failed. In each instance, CHW responded quickly to our needs and dispatched competent professionals to diagnose and fix our ailing equipment. Their phone service staff has listened and responded appropriately to each of our calls. We highly recommend CHW to provide the comfort of knowing that you home is protected against major malfunctions for the foreseeable future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:52:50.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Everything is always resolved quickly and in time.\nThe last set lasted almost 8 months and i feel really comfortable with the quality and but I do think the hair care is needed and you will need to find some instructions online as their instruction is good but not the best and most detailed which they can consider to improve.\nRegarding the shipping, However it depends, USPS delivers can be as quicker as 4-7 days or as slow as 10-15 days and this is why I now stick with UPS/FedEX and normally receive my parcel in 24-48 hours but sometimes i still need to push UPS or Fedex for a even faster delivery and they always do that.\nAnyway, thanks airyhair for your great and hard work and I am glad to see you are improving your site and hair quality from time to time and I am enjoy the customize hair options and yes the 3 tones ombre color and 30\" long hair/thick hair is a nice bonus, which is super hard to find online anywhere else.\nBut I believe you can do it much better in coming year such as reducing the production and delivery time and this is the reason i give 4 stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:36:43.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

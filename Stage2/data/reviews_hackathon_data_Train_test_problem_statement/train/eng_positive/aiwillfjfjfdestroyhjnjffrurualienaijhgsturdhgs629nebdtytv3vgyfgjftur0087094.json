When I ordered pet supplies from Amazon, their shipping method was always hit and miss. Sometimes it would be delivered to my door, sometimes to my mailbox (in a bank of mailboxes over a mile from my home), or left at the post office - a 10-mile drive up the mountain. Chewy.com ALWAYS delivers to my door. I'll pay extra for that (sometimes!)\n2) There are some items that are just flat-out cheaper at Chewy.com. We've got so many songbirds around our house, it's like a Hitchcox film. Their finch food is hands down the cheapest, and the finches love it.\n3) Chewy.com always packs their boxes with big pieces of crinkly brown paper. it's like crack for my two new rescue kittens. A sturdy cardboard box + Crinkly brown paper + Kittens = Best entertainment ever!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:11:15.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

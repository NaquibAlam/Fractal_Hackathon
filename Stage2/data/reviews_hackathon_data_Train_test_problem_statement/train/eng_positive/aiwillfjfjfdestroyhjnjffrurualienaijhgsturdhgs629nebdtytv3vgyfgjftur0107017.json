I used the e-careers support twice, once to enquire about timescales and another to enquire about how to obtain my completion certificate. Both times the support was prompt- and I love that it is available 24-7! The course was informative yet kept my attention as the different modules were split into different sections. I found that I could work my way through a module or 2, and then log out and quite easily find where I left last time. Great course, great website, very happy student!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:55:00.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

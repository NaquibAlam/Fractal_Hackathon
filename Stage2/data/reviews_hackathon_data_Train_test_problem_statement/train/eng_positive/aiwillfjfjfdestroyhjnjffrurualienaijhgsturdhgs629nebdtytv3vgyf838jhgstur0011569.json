He came from a brick&mortar Christian academy, but has now advanced a full grade level in math since starting 2 months ago, and he says the Bible class is so much more interesting than his prior experience of Bible classes that don't actually use the Bible as curriculum, but Enlightium is Bible based, and it is challenging. We are thrilled w/ our decision. Here's his Quote: : \"I've learned more in 2 months than in 2 quarters of [his] 8th grade prior school.\" He is motivated to put on his headphones and log-in. I also love that when I communicate w/ Enlightium, they are the names I see on emails and other communication.

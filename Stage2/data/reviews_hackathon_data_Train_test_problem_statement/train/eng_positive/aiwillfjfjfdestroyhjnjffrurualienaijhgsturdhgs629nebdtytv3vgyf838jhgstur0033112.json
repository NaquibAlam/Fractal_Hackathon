This may have been due to my payment address being different to my shipping address.

Emailed them through their website asking for a refund and was given a full refund immediately. (within the hour) Although I'm disappointed I cannot get my order, they issued a full refund immediately. Thought I'd leave a review since reading all of these reviews made me a little nervous after I emailed asking for a refund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T19:35:23.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

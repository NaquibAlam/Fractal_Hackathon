They let us stay with them before they had left, cooked us dinner and made sure we were settled in and happy! It was more than we could of asked for. The stay was so comfortable in there lovely home and their beautiful dog was a treat to care for. We were to water the plants, feed and care for Lou Lou and be there while there was painting going on the exterior of their house. This was a breeze considering how lucky we were to be staying here. We are very grateful for this experience and would recommend this housesit to anyone! Lou Lou is a pleasure, just make sure you sit on the kitchen step for a cuddle because she enjoys that a lot! :)\nAfter our stay they were great enough to still contact us when mail ended up at their home! Very kind family and beautiful home!\nSarah and Sophie", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T12:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:45:54.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

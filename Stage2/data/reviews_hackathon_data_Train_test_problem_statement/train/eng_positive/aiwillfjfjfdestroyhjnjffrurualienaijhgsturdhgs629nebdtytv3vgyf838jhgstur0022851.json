If there is a princess in your life, this is the perfect keepsake wedding gift... it's beautiful!! It's bigger than I expected (definitely not a trinket) but not too big either; it's just right for a great focal point for a china or curio cabinet. Ordering was a breeze and delivery on time. I was worried about such a fragile item arriving intact but it was well packaged...it even survived being in checked luggage during my flight to the wedding destination! My niece loves it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:11:53.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I did a few months of research looking for a reasonably priced full size folder and the search led me to Green Zone Bikes and 4 months in I can honestly say that I love my Premium Edition FS model bicycle. First off the assembly was very easy as it comes very well packaged and about 80% assembled. Took 10-20 minutes total to unpack and set up. I love that its alloy and only weighs 34 lbs as I was already used to carrying a 33 lb smaller bike. The folding mechanism is much simpler than I was accustomed to even with it being a bigger bicycle overall. The 21 speeds really come in handy because I'm not always on flat or downhill surfaces. I can get to about 16 mph in the highest gear on flat roads. The shocks are great for the off-road as well as city cycling as I'm usually flying off street curbs with no worries. To cut it short I love this bike and it's great that I have to get out and exercise to enjoy it because as much as I love looking at it I enjoy riding it MUCH more. If you want a full size folding bicycle that's reasonably priced and built to get you from point A to B get the FS model. You won't be disappointed!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T22:31:14.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

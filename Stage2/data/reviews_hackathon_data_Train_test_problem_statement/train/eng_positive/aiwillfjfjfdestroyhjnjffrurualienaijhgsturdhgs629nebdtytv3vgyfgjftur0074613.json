The last time I purchased a self-help workbook at almost $7. When I received it, a prior owner had written their answers in the workbook. To me, there is a confidentiality code that was broken by re-selling this book with the answers in it. When I reached out to Thriftbooks I was given back the full purchase price. This is why I have continued to shop with them. As long as the book is in good condition and I can actually use the book for what it was meant for, then I have no problem. When I do have a problem, Thriftbooks has taken care of it. Thank you Thriftbooks!\n~From a satisfied customer~", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:19:47.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

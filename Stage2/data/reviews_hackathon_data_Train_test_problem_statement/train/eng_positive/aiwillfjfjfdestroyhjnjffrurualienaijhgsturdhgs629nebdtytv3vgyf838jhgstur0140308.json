I am a longstanding customer.\nA small detail: I am tall 6 foot and, ideally, the tall classic EVA should be longer than they in the larger sizes and would look better. Also it'd be nice to have colours like grey available in the larger (mostly men's) sizes.\nA really excellent product. Once -several years ago- i purchased a boot in nappa leather (they now have discontinued I see) which had a weak back seam which split. It was replaced quickly and without fuss once I sent a photo. So the quality is excellent but rest assured that, should the unthinkable happen - which it wont (!) you will be well cared for.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:17:12.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

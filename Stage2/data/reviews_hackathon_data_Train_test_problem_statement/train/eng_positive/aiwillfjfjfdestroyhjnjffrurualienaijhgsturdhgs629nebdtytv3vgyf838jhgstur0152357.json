I searched extensively to find a better deal for phone, internet and cable. I found phone at $17 mo. and internet TV at $20 a month, but internet/Wi-Fi . . . well, that wasn't working out so great. I spoke to Anthony about Spectrum and it was a pretty good deal but I wanted to look around before I decided. Anthony helped me with that too.\nWith taxes and mystery fees, my old bill was $ 170 a month. With Spectrum, my bill for phone/internet/cable will be about half as much.\nNo contract/commitment, so if I don't like it, I can move on, but this new service provides more than I had before, so, cool.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:24:35.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

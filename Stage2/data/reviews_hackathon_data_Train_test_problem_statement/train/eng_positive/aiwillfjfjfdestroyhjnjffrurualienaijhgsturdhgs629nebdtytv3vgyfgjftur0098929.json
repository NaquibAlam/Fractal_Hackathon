Great value frames always packed up properly and easy to assemble.\nVery recently I got a frame and one of the 3 mats was the wrong color. This was the first issue I've ever had. They very quickly made the right mat and shipped it fast. The whole issue was very easy to resolve and taken care of in about 2 days which is amazing.\nI wish more online retailers were this good!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:37:28.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I liked that this site had both homeowners and pet sitters pay. I felt that people would be more responsible and dedicated if they paid a fee.\nWe have been member for two years. The first year we lived in the country in Texas so finding a house sitter was harder there with very few (sometimes only ONE applicant) applicants. However, I was able to use the one sitter that applied, so we had pet sitters with this site. Now we live in Florida near the beach and we get TOO many applicants, which is good. We get to pick and choose.\nI have always asked for references and checked them. I have used many new house sitters on this site, that didn't have any reviews on the trustedhousesitters site and they always wanted a great first review, so they did a great job.\nOur pets did great without us -- in fact, I think they were sad to see their housesitter leave them! We had a stress free vacation, knowing our home/pets were in good hands --and our housesitter had a wonderful 'staycation' at our house that is near a Florida beach. So glad I found this service -- will definitely use for future needs!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:47:56.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

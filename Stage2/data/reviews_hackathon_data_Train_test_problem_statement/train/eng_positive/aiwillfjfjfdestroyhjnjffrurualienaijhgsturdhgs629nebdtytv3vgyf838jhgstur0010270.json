I have never had a rude or impersonal person yet. Let me give you my most current experience:\nAt the end of a 6 week project in Final Cut. Computer crashes. I call Apple in a panic since this project will be viewed in 1 week and it has taken 6 weeks to get to this point. Not only do they remote into your computer....but they try everything. We were blessed to have Casandra - Senior Advisor, help us out. She had us copy files which would take 4 hours and told us she would call back to go to step 2 before she left for the evening. Not only did she call us back but she stayed over her time to make sure that she restored the entire project for us. That is over and above the word \"support\". I stand behind Apple....their products....their support...and you should too just in case you have any doubts.\nPat Pagano", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T15:19:17.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

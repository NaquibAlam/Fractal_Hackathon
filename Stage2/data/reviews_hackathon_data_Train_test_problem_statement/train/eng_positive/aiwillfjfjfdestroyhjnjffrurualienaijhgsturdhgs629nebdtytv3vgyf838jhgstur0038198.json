The old one had literally exploded due to our very high water pressure, thus all water supply had been turned off in the Bathroom. ie. No Toilet etc.\nFollowing my discussion with \"S Doc\" on the correct part number required, I ordered on Thursday Morning and my wife was much impressed when the new shower part arrived in our morning post next day.\nThanks very much \"Shower Doctor\".\np.s. I made a water pipe plug, by cutting off the old broken shower box connector. Drilling & Cross lacing it with SS wire and filling it with epoxy resin. This made it possible for the bathroom to continue in operation much to my wife's \"Relief\".\npps.

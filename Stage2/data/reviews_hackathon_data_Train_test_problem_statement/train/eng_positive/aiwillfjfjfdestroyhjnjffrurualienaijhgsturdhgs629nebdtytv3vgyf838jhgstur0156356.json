I've never order contacts online before and I'm glad I went with opticontacts. I placed my order and I sent a picture of my prescription. In the morning after, I had an email from them letting me know that the numbers I placed didn't match the prescription. I didn't realize I put the wrong numbers and I'm impressed they caught it. The order arrived in less than a week with no mistakes. Awesome experience and I'm definitely getting my contacts from them from now on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T11:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:43:59.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I contacted them via email explaining my problems, I got a very quick and pleasant response back. unfortunately, they did not have the brushes in stock but substituted it with a Belgium bamboo brush that was very similar to the stigma brush for fr yes guys for FREE. All because they were sold out of the brush I had paid for. most companies would give you a refund, but they went out of their way to send me another brush that is similar. I was very satisfied and I will definitely be back for more thank you FTB.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T23:19:56.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

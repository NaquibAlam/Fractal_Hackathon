I have always booked directly with the airline. Therefore, I was slightly apprehensive as to what to expect from this site.. However, the service offered was excellent. An incredibly quick and efficient process that provided suitable business class seats at a great price. I would like to compliment Ginger, my contact lady. She did a great job in a very timely manner! Will I use this service again? Certainly! Would I recommend this site to my friends? Certainly!\nNow all I have to do is get on that jet plane!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T19:53:05.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I am getting into black & white film photography, now that I've been forced to send my film out for development, so I will definitely start purchasing film again, this time in larger quantities and more often. Thank you B&H for continuing to support an older, but much loved, format: Film! :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:02:44.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

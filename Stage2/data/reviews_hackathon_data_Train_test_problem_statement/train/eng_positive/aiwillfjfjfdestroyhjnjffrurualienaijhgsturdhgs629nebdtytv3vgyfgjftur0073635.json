Both Pat and Kim in the Stourbridge store made for an enjoyable shopping experience and nothing was too much trouble, even when I wanted to amend and add to my order. They also arranged delivery to fit around my work commitments and not when it was convenient for the delivery schedule. On the morning of delivery I was called with an estimated delivery time by Chris, the delivery guy and they were right on time. When they arrived one of the legs to the dining room table was damaged. No problem! They arranged to replace it and came back to fit it on the same day - amazing! The furniture looks fabulous in my new apartment . I was very impressed with the service from start to finish and would have no hesitation in recommending Hallowood to anyone wishing to buy quality furniture at competitive prices. Keep up the good work guys - you're doing a great job!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:33:00.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

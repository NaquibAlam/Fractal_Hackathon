I was afraid my Rx would be wrong or the glasses wouldn't fit correctly, but once I got them I was more than satisfied. They were perfect! I purchased the glasses Feb 9th and received them Feb 23rd. I have very bad eyesight, so a few days after the 9th I got an email saying because the strength of the prescription making the lens will take an extra 4-7 days. (If you go to any eyesight place in person you usually wait 2 weeks for glasses anyway so I didn't mind the delay.) Firmoo kept me updated the whole time during the process. Once they were completed and shipped on Feb 20th it was super quick shipping. I got them 3 days later (I paid extra for 3-5 day shipping). I will be buying more and I've already recommended the site to friends and family. Thank you Firmoo!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T21:18:13.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

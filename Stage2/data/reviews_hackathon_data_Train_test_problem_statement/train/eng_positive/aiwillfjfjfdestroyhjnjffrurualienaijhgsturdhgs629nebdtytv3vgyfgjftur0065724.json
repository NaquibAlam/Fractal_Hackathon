Everything was ready before the date they gave me which enabled me to have photo album created and shipped to me jus tin time for Valentine's Day! The loose photos and photo albums were returned to me just as they were when I dropped them off.\nWould highly recommend them to anyone interested in converting old photos/home movies to digital, as well as anyone who prefers to use a local, mom and pop, small business. Will definitely use them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T23:32:21.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I contacted Micks garage with a query and spoke to Ciaran who advised me on the type I needed for my particular car. He was prompt with his answers and I placed the order. The delivery was made the following morning. As a follow up enquiry regarding the account I had contact with Miky who gave me good advice about their web site. The product I bought was of good quality and also a very good price. All round I am very pleased with the service given by this company and would buy from them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:11:58.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

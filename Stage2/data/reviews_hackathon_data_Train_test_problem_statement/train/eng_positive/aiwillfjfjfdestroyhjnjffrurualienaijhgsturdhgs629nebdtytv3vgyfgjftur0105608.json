But to my surprise I was extremely grateful that I did. The website with survey had me talking to a trained professional in less than 30 minutes. Even at that point thought I thought, this is to easy to be true. But sure enough within 24 hours someone was at my house, fixed the problem and the cost was exactly around the price they told me over the phone. Homeadvisor.com has me hooked as a customer for any needs that come up for my home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T08:22:41.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They have the lowest prices that we have found for high quality ostomy care supplies! Having two to deal with (urostomy and colostomy) that are not in ideal places (skin folds), and both also being flushed/recessed stomas by design due to \"lack of available plumbing\" we have had a LOT of trial and error in the last two and a half years. When we found ExpressMed, it was like another prayer had been answered because the supplies we found that actually worked for the urostomy were a third of the price than everywhere else! Would recommend this company to anyone! Shipping is also extremely fast, even when using only the standard shipping the supplies arrive in two to three days!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:53:04.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I thought I was replacing my Saeco Odea Go with a similar machine, but this one is much more personal. I get just what I wanted: push a button, and out come 2 long espressos, to my liking, and easy. I can customize my brew, unlike the old Odea. Now I can have my iced latte without all of the mess of a more complicated, non-automatic machine. I can customize the amount and temperature of the water and the amount and grind of coffee. It has a bypass for ground coffee as well. I probably won't use that, and I don't froth milk or steam it (too lazy to clean the wand, I use the microwave). Perfect. I'll buy from them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T05:09:58.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

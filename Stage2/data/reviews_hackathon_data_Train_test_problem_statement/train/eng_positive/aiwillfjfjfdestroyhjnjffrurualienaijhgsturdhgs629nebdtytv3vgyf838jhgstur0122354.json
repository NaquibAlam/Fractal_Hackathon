Obviously, being a local group with no label to help with cost, we look for the most effective use of our (actually God's) money. WTS has been providing us with that over several years. They have always been wonderful to work with, highly professional in both the quality of their work and in their attitude toward us as their customer. Our projects have always been done to our satisfaction and in a timely manner, often finishing before the scheduled delivery date. We just did a new project with them last fall, and had a reorder of an earlier project a couple of weeks ago. As always, great work, done on time, both times.\nIf you're looking for a company to handle duplication of your recording project, our opinion is you can't do any better than WTS!\nRandy Akins\nThe Kingdom Seekers Quartet\nChatsworth, Georgia\nMarch 21, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T08:00:43.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Booked online and was told they would come the next day. Got a call early on in the morning saying they wouldn't be able to and that the tyre wasn't available. However they offered an alternative brand and were with me early the next day. The engineer rang me to let me know he was on the way and then was very quick and polite when changing the tyre and it was very cheap. Would definitely use again and recommend to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:42:14.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

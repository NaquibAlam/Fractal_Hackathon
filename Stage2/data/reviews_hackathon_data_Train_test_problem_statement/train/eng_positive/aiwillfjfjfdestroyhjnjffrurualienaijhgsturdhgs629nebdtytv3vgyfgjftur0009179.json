It is a great company and they treat their drivers very well. I love the fun culture that the company has created as well as all the perks and benefits of driving for Lyft. Lyft has worked very hard to provide. My only complaint is that I have a lots of downtime driving for Lyft. it's really hard to meet the requirements for the bonuses and to earn enough income because I sometimes wait a very long time between calls nearly two hours and can't earn as much. I am very grateful that the company allows our clients to tip on the app.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T20:50:11.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

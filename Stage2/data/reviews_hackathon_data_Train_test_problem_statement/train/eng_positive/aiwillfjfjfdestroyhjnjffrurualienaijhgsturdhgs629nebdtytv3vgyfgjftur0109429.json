I was therefore hesitant about trying Lola naturally (no pun intended), because I've known for years that the natural alternative is never as good as the regular pads/tampons we're accustomed to. I decided to try it out and I am so glad I did!! I got the ultra thin pad with wings, ultra thin liners and a variety of different tampons. My periods are very heavy, and these tampons and pads were able to absorb it all! I cannot recommend this product enough. They are easily inserted, absorbent, comfortable - everything you want minus all the bad stuff!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:09:30.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Arrived as advertised, well packed and on time! Great experience.\nHere is a 30 Day Review of said watch\nPulled the trigger on this December 2016. Fast overnight shipping. Transaction very smooth. (as advertised)\nThis watch uses the new H-10 movement, which is based on the ETA 2836-2, the regulator has been deleted. Power is reserve 80 hrs.\nI was a bit hesitant of the new H-10, as it is not easily regulated. No worries! after a month, it is running at +2/sec total. It wears 12 hours on wrist and spends the remainder of the time crown down on the dresser.\nI tested the rest time in all positions early on and it runs the nearly same regardless of position (testing only measuring against atomic clock).\nIt's positional accuracy is very good. Amazing experience so far with the H-10.\nThe fit n finish is impeccable, the bracelet is above average and all brushed - comfortable. Downside is only 2 pin positions on the micro adjust. 7\" wrist is fine.\nLume is applied to hands and numerals - charges very bright but settles to a duller version that does last well into the night.\nSapphire is double domed and un-coated. This is ok as the hour track is \"brushed\" and provides a nice contrast to the dial face. Red tip in seconds hand is a nice touch.\nAll in all this is a nice refined watch with modern specifications that is based on a classic Tool watch.\nIf you like classic design with upgrades, don't wait - you can't go wrong at this price point with the Hammy.\nPros:\nAffordable\nExtremely Readable\n100m WR (I have showered and swam with it)\nNice modern spec'd version of a classic functional field watch\nAccuracy (YMMV) mine is insanely good\nPower reserve\nFit n Finish very good\n20mm lugs (its a strap monster - nato etc)\nSigned Crown\nSwiss\nCons:\nno screw down crown (it IS usable in water - I do daily)\n(make sure crown is seated!!)\nno AR coating (if you like or require it)\n2 pin position on bracelet micro adjustment\nreally not decorated, yet has see thru back", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:59:56.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

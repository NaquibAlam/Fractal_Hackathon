It all began when I was looking for a coupon to purchase wine, for a wedding gift, and then it led to me finding things for my new puppies. I really like the variety of merchandise and services available and the prices are ridiculous! I was able to get a $70 bottle of wine, etched with the bride and grooms name and wedding date, for only $29! It was a great savings. This isn't like other shopping sites, so for some of the items I ordered next day or 2nd day delivery was not available. The wait to have something delivered was worth it considering how much money I saved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T14:20:48.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

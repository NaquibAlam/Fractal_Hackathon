I need a good mattress because I broke my back in 2005 falling off my horse and the need for comfort is very important to me but excellent support is a must. So through all my comparisons I kept coming back to the Saatva Brand. No one could beat the price and only one or two could really compare. It was also important to me that it was American Made as well.\nSo I purchased my first 2 mattresses March of 2015 after my divorce. A King size 14.5\" plush for me and a Queen size 14.5\" Luxury Firm for my son. The delivery guys were awesome, very friendly and speedy.The first night I slept on my mattress was like sleeping on a cloud. I woke with no aches or pains anywhere.My 20 yr old also loved the comfort of his mattress. Best purchase ever! I absolutely have no reservations about recommending they mattresses to my friends or family members.\nI LOVED the mattress so much, I bought another one in July 2016 but this time I bought a King Plush 11.5 \" with a 8\" foundation because the new bed frame needed one. So the other King mattress was put in the guest room on a platform frame. Now my guests will have a taste of the wonderful Saatva mattress comfort as well. Thank you for making such a fabulous mattress and having superior customer service.\nSincerely, Wendy L.

My very first was looking after a young cat recovering from a broken leg. Theowner immediately put me at ease on my arrival and showed me around her lovely apartment. Her cat was still at the vets but collected the next day. H had a lovely btemperamnet and was very easy to give medication and look after. I found time to also explore the nearby canal and take walks in the lovely surrounding countryside. Would highly recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:53:44.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

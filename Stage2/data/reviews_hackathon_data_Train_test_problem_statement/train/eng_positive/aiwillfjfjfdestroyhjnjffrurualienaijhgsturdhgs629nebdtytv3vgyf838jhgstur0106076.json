I dropped the item off to Chris and received the same excellent service and advice in a polite manner.\nThe parcel arrived in Finland by the P&S scheduled date and the tracking information was excellent.\nThe P&S service is often cheaper than Australia Post, and handles weights and dimensions that Australia Post cannot. The speed of international delivery (DHL I believe) is very impressive and the staff at Frankston 3199 most helpful.\nWhilst I always use the \"self service\" I have always called the outlet if I had the slightest concern relating to my shipment and received helpful and courteous advice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T12:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T11:24:24.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

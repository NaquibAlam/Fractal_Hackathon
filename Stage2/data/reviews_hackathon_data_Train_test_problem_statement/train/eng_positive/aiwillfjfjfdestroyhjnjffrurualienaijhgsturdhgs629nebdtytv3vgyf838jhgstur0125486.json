I had stayed at Starwood's other site, Westin next door & took the opportunity with the exceptional offer to try the Sheraton. As a Starwood Privilege member & SPG member I am aware these 2 hotels are under the Starwood banner & drinks & meals from either site can be billed to your account to pay on check-out. I contacted Sheraton at Denarau Fiji as reviews seemed to suggest this site was more suitable for families & found this was indeed their niche. As I am travelling on my own I requested Agoda advise me if I could transfer my payment to the Westin which appears more suitable for solo travellers. Agoda advised \"cancellation is out of the question as well due to YOUR cancellation policy which won't allow a free cancellation policy\". I didn't ask or expect a free cancellation, I asked for a transfer. \"YOUR Policy\"? I agreed to Agoda's policy. Agoda's response was abrupt, curt & definitely not designed to encourage me to rebook any further bookings with Agoda. As a frequent Business & First Class traveler, this level of communication was below par on a Customer Service scale. Not because I requested a transfer, because of their abrupt dismissive rude response. I have no wish to book with Agoda in the future. I suggest there are better customer service focussed sites with equally great deals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:18:16.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

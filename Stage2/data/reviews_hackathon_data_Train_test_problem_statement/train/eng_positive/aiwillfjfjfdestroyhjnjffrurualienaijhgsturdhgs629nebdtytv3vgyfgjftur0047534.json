She's 93. Her original press lasted about 35/40 years before the handle came off. My dad managed to screw the handle back on...it then lasted another 20 years. Three years ago I gave her a new press. It just wasn't the same. The volume of dough in the tube was reduced by more than half. This required one to take everything apart and refill the tube. Finding the exact original Mirro cookie press from Roby Lane at a very reasonable price was perfect. Not only was the press in excellent condition as described, but it came with the box, cookie forms and the original cookbook...all priceless. My mom is trilled and so am I!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T09:16:42.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

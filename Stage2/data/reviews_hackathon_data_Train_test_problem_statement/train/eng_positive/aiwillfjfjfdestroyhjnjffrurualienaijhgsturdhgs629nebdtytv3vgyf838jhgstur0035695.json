DHL deliver the package a day before the due date that was fine because I live in the Bahamas. The earlier the better it was because how far the chocolate came from. Now, the chocolates themselves was incredible, taste like no chocolate my hubby had before. He love them.\nI will order with zchocolat next time. It will not be my last order...Great Experience.üëåüèΩüéä", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T23:06:54.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

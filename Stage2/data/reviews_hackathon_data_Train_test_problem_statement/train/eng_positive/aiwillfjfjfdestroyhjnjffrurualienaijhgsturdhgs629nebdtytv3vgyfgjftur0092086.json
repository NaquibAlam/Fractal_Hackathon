But we chose Intetrent and it was a bad choise. They make us wait 90 minutes to be attended at the office because there's only one person in the office to run two companies (Interrent is the low cost company of Europcar). They atended firstly all the clients of Europcar before swiching to Interrent desk. Then the outsde of the car was dirty and with scraches (inside was ok).

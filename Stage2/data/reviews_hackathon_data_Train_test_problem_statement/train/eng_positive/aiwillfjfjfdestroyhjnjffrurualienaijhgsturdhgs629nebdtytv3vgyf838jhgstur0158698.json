We did a 10 day escorted tour. Everything went smoothly for the most part. We booked well in advance and there was a time with a bit of a lull in communications but no actual problem. Every accommodation booked was wonderful and there were no issues with reservations. We were two families with a bus and driver. The driver was absolutely and utterly fantastic. He made the trip a memorable experience. My kids loved him and his accent both. They spent the next year saying \"I tink so\" and \"good craic\" in faux Irish accents. Ashford Castle in particular is a die and gone to heaven place. Best hotel in the world in my opinion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:50:50.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

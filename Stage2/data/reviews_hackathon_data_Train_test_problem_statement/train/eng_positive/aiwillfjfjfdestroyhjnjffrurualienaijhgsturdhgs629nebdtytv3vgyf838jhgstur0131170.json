It was packed very well and even though i had some issues with UPS the product was in perfect condition. As far as UPS, not so sure. Product left the company in Montana, got an arrival scan to my major sorting facility in CO, Got a departure scan and then an arrival scan to the nearest delivery facility to my town. Then got a departure scan and was supposedly out for delivery but ended up in Sioux City Iowa, then to Nebraska then back to the major CO facility. My package was delayed two days.

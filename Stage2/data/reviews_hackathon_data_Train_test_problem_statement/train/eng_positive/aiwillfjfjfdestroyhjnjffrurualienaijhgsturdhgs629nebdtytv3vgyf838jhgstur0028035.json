I was not able to get a flight home with the carrier we booked to fly there with, as they were all booked up, by the time I realized this. I panicked and searched the internet for flights to return home. I did find one at a more reasonable price with Flight Hub. I also entered my husbands birthdate year incorrectly so I called the agent and he very pleasantly came to my assistance. He cancelled the insurance, that I did not want. Because I neglected to hit both insurance buttons (medical, and trip cancellation). The flight hub agent was very patient and kind and fixed everything right away. He ensured the e-mails of the changes went through to me, before we said good-bye. Moral of the story be very careful and thorough when booking flights and hit round trip buttons, and be sure your not buying anything you don't want!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:21:01.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

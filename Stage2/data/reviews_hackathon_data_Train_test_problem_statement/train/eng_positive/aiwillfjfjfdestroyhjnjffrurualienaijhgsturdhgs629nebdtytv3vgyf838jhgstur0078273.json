I'm very happy with the quality of all the products so far, as they all look built too last. I live on a rural property and was surprised by how quickly my order arrived. Before purchasing, I did a lot of research and this company's prices were very competitive and their customer service was excellent, as I was on the phone to them with questions several times. Keep up the great work Gym Direct!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T21:41:10.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

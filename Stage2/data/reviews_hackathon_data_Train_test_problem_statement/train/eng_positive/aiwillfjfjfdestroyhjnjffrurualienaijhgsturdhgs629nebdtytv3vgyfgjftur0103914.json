Both syringes got stuck after just a few applications, but being back in Italy I couldn't go to the store and ask for replacement. I emailed Oceane customer service only to ask if there was any way to get the product out of the airless tubes other than pumping it out. Farrenn replied after just a few hours, and explained to me that the problem with the syringes was probably caused by improper storage and that he would report that to the store. He said my satisfaction was his number one priority and he was going to replace them at no cost, and include a free gift for the inconvenience caused by this situation. All I had to do was providing my shipping address and proof of purchase. In 24 hours the products were shipped to me in Italy, at no cost. What else can I say? Amazing products and amazing customer service!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T12:52:42.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

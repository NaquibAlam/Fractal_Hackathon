So it's my first real look at what I ordered! (G070 Grey Distressed faux leather)\nWell, I am very pleased! It looks completely real and even feels real; better quality than I could have expected.\nI wouldn't hesitate to order from DDF again. They were easy to order from, definitely security conscious, and very helpful when it turned out I needed additional fabric. They were always courteous!\nThanks DDF :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:13:00.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

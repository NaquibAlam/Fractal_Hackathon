I had zero experience with girls at all. I wanted to change that when I became 25 and decided to force myself to try dating and use it to gain experience.\nWhen I was researching for helpful information, I stumbled across Derek Cajun's product \"The Gentleman's guide to Online Dating\" and that guide alone enabled so many good things for me. I learned the value of a strong dating profile which attracted girls, leaving the need to use time \"hunting\". I was shocked that being cheeky and proud about it actually worked. I was the one getting messages from girls and this blew my mind, fast forward and I had my first date.\nStudying the \"Question game\" included like my own personal bible, I nervously went out on my first date. I started the game and over the course of the game I could see distinct changes in her body language and behavior. I could see and feel the attraction progress happening right before my eyes, she leaned in etc, she touched her hair, she was smiling ear to ear and most of all she was super engaged and vibrant. It was a so successful that it shocked me \"Why isn't everyone using this!??!\"\nI kept dating and became better for each time, I ended up dating total 13 different girls, gave a steamy kiss on every first date and also got a follow up date every time. I literally became in-love with dates and have never experienced boredom or awkward dates. It has always been a blast for me. I could have dated more but the 13th girl became my girlfriend!\nI would recommend this to ANYONE who feels insecure about or just wants to up their game in DATING to pick up that guide and give it a read. I know some of it sounds absurd, but really it works. You just have to follow the guide exactly like it says. This will enable you to have amazing fun/sexy dates and you literally only need the question game to have success on the date. Thing is, you cant do it halfway, you need to do it properly, so you need some balls, because some of the material requires you to be bold.\nThis also made me become really good at job-interviews because I became really good at making a strong first impressions. I wish this was a mandatory read for guys , so maybe the negative misconception about dating would fade.\nPS: This guide will learn you attract girls but keeping them around is all on you. Thanks for reading and I hope this was helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T19:38:37.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

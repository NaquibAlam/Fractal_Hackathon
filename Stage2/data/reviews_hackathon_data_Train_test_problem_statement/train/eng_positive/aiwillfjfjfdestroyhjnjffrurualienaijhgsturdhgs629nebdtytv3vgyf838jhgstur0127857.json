Took the car back to Garrett and the boys and found that I had a nail in one of my tires.\nGarrett plugged it and offered to replace the tire, no charge. I couldn't believe it! He didn't have to offer it up but this showed me that his (their) customer service was top notch!\nI work in tech support for my company and know that companies live or die by their service.

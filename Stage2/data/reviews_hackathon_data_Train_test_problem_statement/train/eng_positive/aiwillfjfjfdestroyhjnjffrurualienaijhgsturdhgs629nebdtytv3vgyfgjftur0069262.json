The person I spoke with on the phone was extremely helpful and asked a few questions. We discussed what my vehicle was doing and he said that he suspected it was a wheel bearing and not the transmission and asked that I bring the vehicle down so he could drive it and see first hand what it was doing, which I did. On the Test Drive, Right off the bat he said that it was a wheel bearing and not an issue with the transmission. Now I'm no mechanic so he could have told me that it was the transmission, did whatever he wanted to the transmission and replaced the wheel bearing at the same time, charged me whatever they wanted and I would have never known the difference! If you are reading this review thinking of using Cottman Transmission in Gladstone for your issue with your car, rest assured that you can trust (TRUST) these folks to be honest with you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:16:53.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

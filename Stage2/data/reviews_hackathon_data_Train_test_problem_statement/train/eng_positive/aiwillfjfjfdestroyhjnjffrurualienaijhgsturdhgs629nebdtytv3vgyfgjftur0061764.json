Their website sorts thousands of nuts, bolts and washers into a logical arrangement that is easy to work through. The precise dimension data is a great help.\nMy most recent purchase was eye bolts. Their working load data showed me that it made a lot of sense to go from 5/16\" (which I had planned on) up to 3/8\". I got a huge increase in strength at a very modest increase in cost.\nI, also, appreciate that I can get a price break without buying huge quantities of an item.\nThis is, definitely, the way to buy bolts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T21:29:33.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

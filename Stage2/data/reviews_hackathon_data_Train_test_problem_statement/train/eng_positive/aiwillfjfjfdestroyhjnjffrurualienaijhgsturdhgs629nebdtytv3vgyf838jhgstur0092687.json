Reliability is an area. The app has problems with reliability. It picks up people on it's own, shuts itself off and navigation issues within itself and working with Waze. It also show the passenger where they aren't.\nAccuracy in passenger location would be helpful. It should be able to confirm a pick up just in case it decides to do it on it's own. Choose a feature like, I didn't pick up passenger yet.\nTo be able to rotate the map so it's easier to read and navigate would be nice.\nPassengers in Lyft Lines should have a limited rating system for the driver and to be able to rate the other passengers in the Lyft Line.\nRatings should have a time limit.\nCharge the passenger if they cancel after driving for 10 mins to pick up. Or if they cancel when you arrive. Must be actively driving to passenger and ask why passenger cancelled.\nJust some suggestions.\nOther than that. Lyft is great!\nOh yes! Two more things. Fares are too low in San Francisco and/or Lyft fees should be dropped back to 20% for ALL drivers.\nHave a wonderful day and keep Lyfting!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:16:27.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

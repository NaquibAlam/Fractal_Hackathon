My children love it. I recommend it. It has a farm story book to read for children's bedtime and the Groclock lets children know when it is time to get up with sun symbol and stars for night. You can set the time and it has a wake up alarm. I would highly recommend this product as it is a fun for children to learn and parents have their children wake up at a decent hour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:12:24.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

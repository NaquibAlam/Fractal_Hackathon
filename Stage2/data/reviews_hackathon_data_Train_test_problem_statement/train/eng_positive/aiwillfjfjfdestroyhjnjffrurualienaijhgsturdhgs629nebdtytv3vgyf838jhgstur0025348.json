You're always there for me. Some glitches in combining searches and shopping carts when I break up my shopping over a few days might have cost you a few hundred dollars from me. I don't want to scatter my purchases out, like the free shipping, like to use one coupon, but when I shop via different specials that come up in my email at different times, can't seem to combine the shopping carts. So, I tend to walk away. But, I love you anyway. Thanks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T13:12:42.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

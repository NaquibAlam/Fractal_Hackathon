Their service is \"remarkable.\"\nMy first phone contact was with Andrew--he was patient, answered all my questions, even going out to the showroom floor to \"test\" chairs for me. Visiting the showroom was well worth the 90 minute drive from Palm Springs. Dario welcomed us and made us feel right at home. We spent the next three hours testing chairs and asking questions all of which were answered. By that afternoon we chose our chairs and Alex concluded the sale explaining all of our options.\nOur chairs were delivered yesterday (white glove--worth it if you don't want the hassle of dealing with tons of cardboard and packaging). They look and feel better in our home than on the showroom floor. We could not be more satisfied. We know we got an excellent product at a fair price. Thank you Andrew, Dario and Alex!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:15:30.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

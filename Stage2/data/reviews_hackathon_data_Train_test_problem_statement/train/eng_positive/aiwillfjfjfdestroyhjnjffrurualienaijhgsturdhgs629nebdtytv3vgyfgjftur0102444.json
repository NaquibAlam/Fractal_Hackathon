We have one in our Massachusetts home and two in our Florida home. The Saatva mattress is a truly amazing mattress that not only lives up to expectations, it exceeds them. They are the most comfortable and most well made mattresses. No more tossing and turning to get a comfortable night's sleep. No more looking for that sweet spot to settle in. Every spot on the mattress is a sweet spot. We sleep better than we have in years. Another added feature is the delivery service and delivery people who set up the delivery, confirm the delivery, show up and on time and are always nice courteous and very helpful. It's a great experience from beginning to end. No painful customer service issues - they do what they say. We highly recommend Saatva - their mattress and their team. They do it right and we could not be happier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:59:34.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The closest passport agency to my house was 3 hours away, so I needed to have the service appear on my behalf. I had trouble finding information about reputable expeditors on the internet, so I was very nervous about using this service. Once i paid (and it is expensive) i received a complete list of instructions. If you follow the instructions exactly, you should be in good shape. Once I registered, I was given an order number and called customer service where Merceline had me verify all my paperwork to confirm I was ready. She caught one mistake that may have saved the day! I paid for the 3 to 5 business day turnaround and it took 4 business days + overnight shipping time (factor that in as extra). The company emails status updates for major milestones and customer service can give additional information that isn't automatically shared. Best part about Rushmypasspot was that they came through, worst part is the price. If you can't physically get to a passport agency, try rushmypassport!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T20:29:29.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

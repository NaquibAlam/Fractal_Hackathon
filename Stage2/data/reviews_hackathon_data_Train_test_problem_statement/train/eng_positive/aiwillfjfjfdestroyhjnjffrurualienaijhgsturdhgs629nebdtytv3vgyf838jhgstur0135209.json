I spent the next 15 or so minutes doing side by side comparisons with a wide variety of headphones, with a staff member occasionally checking in to see if I needed any assistance.\nI was able to do a direct comparison with the more popular, more expensive M50x and found the M40x sounded better to my ear. So, satisfied, I headed off to the counter. The salesperson didn't try to pressure me into the more expensive cans as had been the case in other stores I had visited and even threw in a hard case for free. Absolute legend.\nBasically, can't fault them in any way. I just need to keep myself away from their store because I could spend a l t of money in there. The range of equipment on display is amazing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:31:16.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

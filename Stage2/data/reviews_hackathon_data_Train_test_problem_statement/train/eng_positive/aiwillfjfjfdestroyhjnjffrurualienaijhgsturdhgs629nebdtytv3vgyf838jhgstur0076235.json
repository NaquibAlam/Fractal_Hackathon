Even if just to browse. And they're always very obliging even if just to browse! Great service, very friendly, knowledgeable. And if they have something you're after, they'll get it for you. Have been seeing them (K' Road, Albany, and more recently Henderson) for almost 25 years now. Chris from Henderson is amazing, as was Jackie form Albany (but she's recently resigned). Richard is exceptional too. You have a loyal customer in me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:27:45.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Marvin from customer service reached out to me and encouraged me to have it delivered sooner as they were having a hard time keeping this piece in stock. I appreciate that as we did not want it to go on back order. It was delivered at the time they said and we stored it in the garage until the contractor was ready to install it. It was ready to be in stalled in early February and when he opened the box to one of the sinks, he noticed a small but noticeable crack. Unfortunately we could not use this sink and I went back to Marvin and Monique in customer service at Modern Bath House. They let me know that they would go to the manufacturer and let them know. They followed up with me immediately letting me know that the manufacturer would not pay to replace the sink or pay for shipping as it was outside the delivery window. Marvin however, did let me know that Modern Bath House would be happy to replace the sink at no charge and pay for the shipping. He sent me the tracking number and I had the sink within 7 days. I was so appreciative as we had to find the matching sink to the other one or it would have messed up the entire project and would have cost us more labor hours with our contractor. I would definitely shop from them again and I appreciate so much that they were so responsive and accommodating. The piece is really beautiful as well!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:59:26.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

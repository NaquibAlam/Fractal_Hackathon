I often get requests to do a picture on a larger scale. I just don't have the same love of painting larger as I do small. So I have found that I can easiy have a 3\"X3\" (original size) which I used a quality scanner to reproduce as a jpeg submitted to American Frames to reproduce as an 8\"X8\" (as an example) on quality paper and then mounted onto archival board as well as ordering quality matt for the size frame I have already purchased. One of the major qualities of true miniature art is that it can hold up to magnification. People are amazed that my reproductions look so well in the larger format... Also, turnaround is quick, packed well, and very reasonably priced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:36:43.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I ordered the tyres yesterday (Saturday) and was pleasantly surprised that there was a next day option. This morning I received an email stating that my fitting time was scheduled for between 12:11 and 14:11. At approximately 11:55 the fitter turned up, so I gave him my locking wheel nut bit and left him to get on with it. Approximately 45 minutes later all four tyres had been changed and I hadn't left the comfort of my own home.\nTyres On The Drive offer a wide range of tyres by all the main brands, plus several that I haven't come accross and they are competitively priced.\nWithin twenty minutes of the fitter (Danny W) I received an email containing my invoice, details of the work completed and a report on the state of each set of brake pads and discs. It also had the fitters name, hence the reference to Danny W.\nI cannot find fault with this service, which is quite unusual for me. I will definately be using Tyres On The Drive again, but hopefully not this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:19:03.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

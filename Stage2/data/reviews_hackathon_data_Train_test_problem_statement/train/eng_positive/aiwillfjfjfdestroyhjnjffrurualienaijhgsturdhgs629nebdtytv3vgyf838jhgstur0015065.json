We have a number of CDs that we use in our program. In our earlier days we had tried several other CD duplication companies but were not entirely satisfied.\nSomewhere around eight years ago we ran across WTS and decided to try them for our next run of CDs. We have been nothing but exceedingly pleased with this business relationship. Larry Russell is a stellar rep - turnaround time is speedy - and the finished product of the highest quality. ALL this at discount prices!\nI highly recommend this company for your duplication/replication needs\nand any of the other services offered by WTS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:56:57.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

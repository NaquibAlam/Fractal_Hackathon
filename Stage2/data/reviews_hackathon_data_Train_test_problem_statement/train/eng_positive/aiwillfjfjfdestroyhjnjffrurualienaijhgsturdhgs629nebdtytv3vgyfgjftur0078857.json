The delivery was incredibly fast and the bands were excellent quality, very light weight (only ~1.5kg), and easy to pack into my suitcase! Buying these bands before my vacation was honestly the best decision I've ever made - it was like bringing an entire gym with me overseas! The bands allowed me to workout everyday with no restrictions - I could exercise by the pool, in the house, at the beach, the park, anywhere! The varying resistance the bands provide is quite challenging (2kg-18kg) and I would highly recommend purchasing them if you're travelling and don't want to lose all of your hard earned progress from the gym! Even if you don't travel, the bands are still much cheaper than buying a gym membership, are easy to use, and you can do almost every resistance exercise under the sun with them! Seriously, do yourself a humongous favour and get yourself some resistance bands - I promise you won't regret it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:08:30.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

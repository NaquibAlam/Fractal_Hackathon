Running out of phone credit late at night while talking on the phone can be frustrating especially when you don't have any available scratch cards remaining.\nI remember running low on credit and not wanting to interrupt my call. While talking to a friend, I went online at the same time and purchased credit from Ding.com and was able to continue my call without interruption.\nWhat's also nice is that friends can purchase credit for you. I've purchased top up credit for my friends on various holidays.\nI LOVE the convenience and ease of being able to purchase phone credit at any time. :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T05:24:36.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When the time came to quit fooling around in the studio and actually release the project Disk Makers guided me through each step. I had planned to use Harry Fox for cover songs, but used Easy Song Licensing instead because it kept all work on the project under one umbrella. (And I think they were actually a little cheaper.)\nArtwork was a problem for me. I had the cover photo I planned to use, and some other helpful pictures, but Disk Maker's art department put it all together much better than I could have imagined. And then I used their Mastering service. My own mixes could sound good on my home stereo OR my car OR my earphones. The mix that came back sounds great no matter where I play it. In my day job I am an engineer, but I cannot imagine what they did with that Mastering service. It appears to be an example of the old saying, \"any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"\nI had not even considered selling the project on CD Baby, but Disk Makers' distribution package was so easy to use there was no reason not to do it. And I love the commemorative plaque they offered. It certainly marks a milestone in my musical experience.\nThe whole experience was seamless and easy. I got timely calls from their project people to make sure all my questions were answered and to keep me updated. It's hard to believe such a complex process could be so easy and fun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T02:13:27.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Since that time, I had +70 orders. Some orders went missing in the post, some products arrived damaged. When I filed a complaint with Banggood, I got a reply within a few hours and a satisfying response: refund, resend, etc. All interactions were done in perfect English as well. Furthermore: after investigating the missing items, it turned out it was in the last 5km of the travel that the packages went missing. A well deserved 5 from me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T23:48:50.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I had just splurged for regular TF frames in the US, with progressive lenses, and could not afford that on top of the price. But kept wanting them.

They arrived from Italy via FEDEX within 3 days of ordering, absolutely perfect. I chose not to get prescriptions done, as I found an optician doing progressives locally.

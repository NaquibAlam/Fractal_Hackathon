The meals have been a hit with our picky teenagers and we have found this to be a huge help to navigate our hectic work/school week. I love having everything I need ready to prepare, with clear instructions, photos of steps, and even an estimation of time that it will take me to put it all together. This has saved us from resorting to eating out or eating less healthy food options. I am grateful to have options in meal selection and for the freshness of the products delivered straight to my door. I appreciate the variety of menu options that have pushed us out of our comfort zone at times as well. I highly recommend this to busy families or couples looking to save time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:30:49.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

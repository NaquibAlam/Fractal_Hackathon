The website is simple, clear and effective. I have used many rental companies around the world and this one has proven reliable and cost effective. My tip for Granada is to organise rental in the \"City\" location rather than airport for ease of pickup-drop off and use airport to city/city to airport bus for 3 euros per trip. Also, limit searches to exclude Dollar and if possible choose Enterprise which is based in south of city opposite Neptuno Shopping Centre.Their local service (English speaking) is superb. On the day upgrades are often possible, but this might negate any extra DYS insurance you have taken out. I strongly recommend DYS. Sign up for their email offers before your trip and you may benefit from seasonal discounts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:03:29.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They arrived that November and were planted the day after arrival. The cherry tree is doing well but the raspberry plants did not show any sign of life the next spring. I contacted them that summer and we were given several options: to replace the plants the next time dormant ones were available, receive a store credit or credit of the purchase price. We close to receive the plants and just received and planted then this past month. They are dormant but we hope they will do well.

Recently I found an old DVD recorder (well it was made on 2005) as a \"barn find\", well I must to say an \"old office find\". I requested to the manager to sell it to me, but he give it to me for free. The item was in good condition, but it has not the remote control, I was looking for one remote control in Mexico but i did not find one which was in operation. So, I found the Ronded.com web site (accidentally I must to say) at the Yahoo page and saw the original remote control, which was not so expensive and with shipping costs cheaper than costs of the remote control; so I decided to buy one, because the DVDR that I found is a Philips DVDR3355 and Rounded. com is on the Netherlands (The Holly Land of Philips, and I suppoused that they must know Philips better than others). I was surprised with the good communication and support of Rounded.com about the purchase direction, and the information about the shipment. Certainly I was not hurried about the delivery date, and four days after the purchase I received one new remote control. But the fact that was more amazing is that somebody (Mr. Dingemanse) was interested to know if the purchase was all right and asked me an evaluation about the purchase process. That is a Great Quality at Service! I am very happy with my new remote control for the DVDR because I can record all the videotapes of my old Sony Handycam Camcorder to a lot of DVDs. At weekends I enjoy when see old videos of my children when they were babies, toddlers and kids; and now I Can see them several times on DVD which I can share with my family. That is the reason why a remote control can to make somebody happy. Thanks, Rounded.com!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:32:30.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They were very thorough in their explanation on how they were going to go about handling things. They were in constant contact with me via phone and email to keep me informed of the process and all updates. I had hired a different company prior to them that went out of business and never resolved my tax issues. Hiring the Victory Tax Solutions team was the best decision I made. I highly recommend them to any one who is need of their service.

When the weather is pool friendly, the stores are very busy, and often out of stock. In the off season, they carry little stock, and don't have many sales people. With Doheny I find the selection is huge, prices are competitive, the on line ordering is easy, and I get to buy what I want, not just what's available at my local store. They ship quickly, and I usually have my supplies in a couple of days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:45:43.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Alex Osorio was so good to work with! I had read many glowing reviews of others, so it was a simple decision to ask for Alex by name. After I explained what our seating needs were, he outlined several options. He caused me to realize that a choice of leather over bonded leather didn't have to break the bank! After hearing about our plans to move the chairs into our new home theater, he correctly recommended that we \"pass\" on the \"white glove delivery\". Finally, when I explained that we were yet to close on the house, he delayed our shipment until the best possible date. Our chairs arrived in mint condition, as they were very carefully packaged. All in all, our experience with Alex and 4Seating could NOT have gone better! We highly recommend them!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:07:56.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

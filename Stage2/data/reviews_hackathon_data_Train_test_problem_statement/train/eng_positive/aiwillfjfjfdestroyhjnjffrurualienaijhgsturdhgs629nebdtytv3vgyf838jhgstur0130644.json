I ordered 100 tags, just to be sure they would turn out as I expected. The free shipping was a great bonus! The initial process of designing/ordering/etc took about a month, but reordering was quick, and took one week to get to my doorstep! Their customer service reps are quick to respond, and were very helpful in providing recommendations for different materials. The proof and my product looked identical. I was so impressed when I received the first 100, that I ordered 500 more (and for an even better price per unit)!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:58:39.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I am so pleased that I did. The rug is beautiful, colors as depicted, particularly with the video. The rug came quickly, is of excellent quality, and looks beautiful. The rug was folded in half for shipping. I was concerned that we would have fold marks in the rug, but we did not. We had a minor issue with the rug pad, but I called and it was handled immediately.

I was worried at first because I didn't want thousands of lenders calling me after I completed the request. They didn't. Sean's team called right away and he walked me through the getting started process. It was so well organized, clear and easy. Their team was \"on it\" all the way. Every phone call or email returned immediately, no question left unanswered. Very smart, efficient and easy. Last mortgage I felt like a criminal. with Quicken, I felt like a valued client. Thank you Sean, Tomika and team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T20:40:39.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

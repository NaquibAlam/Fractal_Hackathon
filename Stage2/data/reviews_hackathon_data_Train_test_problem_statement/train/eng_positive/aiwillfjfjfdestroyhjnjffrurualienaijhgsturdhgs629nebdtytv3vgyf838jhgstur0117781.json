Never in a million years did I think I'd walk out with a new Queen bed and a nightstand. How did this happen you ask? Well first of all, the customer service was stellar. Will met me at the door, pleasant and full of knowledge, showing the best professionalism and patience I have ever seen. He was able to answer any question I had, and was so helpful with my extremely busy 4 year old. He was able to settle my son down with snacks, and even tied his shoes! :-) As I was waiting for the pieces I found to be wrapped and readied, I walked the store and found the best sale I'd ever seen on the Colleen bed, a most glamorous piece of furniture indeed. The cost of the bed and the nightstand fit well under my budget, and I wasn't even searching for a new bed. The sale was seamless, and I was in and out of the store within an hour. The highlight of the purchase was SAME DAY DELIVERY. By 10:00 p.m. that evening, my new pieces were delivered by very thorough and professional delivery men, who set up my bed and nightstand within 20 minutes. I can't say enough great things about Gardner White, and I will always shop with Gardner White for my furniture needs in the future. Thanks again to Will, and the delivery team!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T16:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:37:38.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

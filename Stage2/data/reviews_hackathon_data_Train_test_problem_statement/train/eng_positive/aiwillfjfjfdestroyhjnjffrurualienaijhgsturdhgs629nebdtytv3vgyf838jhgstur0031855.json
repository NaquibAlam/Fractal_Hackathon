I arrived a few hours later than expected and even though it was early hours, Amanda helped me shift some bags from the car to her garage and kept them there for safety. Staying with Amanda with 2 beautiful cats and 2 bouncy dogs was, simply put, 'I loved every minute of it'. There were times that we were 'ships in the night' with working etc, but there was no uncomfortable feelings entering someone else's home. The pets always made me feel welcome when Amanda wasn't there to! I will miss staying there and hopefully keep in touch. If Amanda is reading this, thank you for being such an amazing host. :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T11:01:57.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

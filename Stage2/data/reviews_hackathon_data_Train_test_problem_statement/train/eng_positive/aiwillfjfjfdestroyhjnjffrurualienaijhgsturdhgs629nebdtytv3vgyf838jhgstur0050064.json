Living in such a rural area can make it very difficult to find the pageant gowns I want. What I usually do is order all my dresses online. I used to order from Prom Girl, but I wasn't too pleased with the lack of sizes and variety Prom Girl offered. I had my heart set on a white Sherri Hill dress, but I couldn't find it in my size or color.\nI did some research and I found Peaches! I'm only 5 feet tall and that can make finding dresses small enough for me difficult. Peaches had all sizes in every dress I was interested in! Peaches had my dream dress! So I placed my order on a Thursday, and it was delivered to me on Monday. Talk about fast shipping! When I opened my order, everything was perfect! My dress looked amazing and fit perfectly, and I also had a new, high quality garment bag with my dress! No other stores online sent garment bags, so that was another benefit from ordering from Peaches! So now when my pageant friends are wondering where I got my dress, they'll see my garment bag and know it was from Peaches!\nAll together, my experience was amazing and I will be ordering all my next pageant gowns from here. I highly recommend ordering from Peaches!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T23:36:46.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

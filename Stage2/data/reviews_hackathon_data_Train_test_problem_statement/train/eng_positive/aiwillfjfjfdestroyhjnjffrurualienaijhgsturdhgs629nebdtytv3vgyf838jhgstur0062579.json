From our arrival, you had everything covered, starting with groceries and cold drinks stocked in the fridge. If we needed dinner reservations or attraction advice, a rental car or taxi, you had us covered!\nThe villa was clean, beds were comfortable and all was exactly as the photos. The location was extraordinary, as we watched sunsets at night and fishing boats in the morning. We loved walking the pristine beaches, and floating in the oceans waves or pool, in the afternoon.\nThe location was outstanding, we could walk easily to the areaâ€™s amazing restaurants and the Paynes Bay Fish Market, home of the freshest tuna, in the world! They even tell you how to prepare and cook like a gourmet Bajan chef!\nWith gratitude, I recommend Waterside 405 and your group, as the ultimate team for making dream vacations come true!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T07:50:46.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

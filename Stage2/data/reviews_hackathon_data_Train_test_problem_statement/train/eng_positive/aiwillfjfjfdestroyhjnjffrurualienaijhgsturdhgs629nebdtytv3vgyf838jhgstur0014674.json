I was reluctant to order online as she can be difficult to fit (return policy is 7 days). The dress was delivered quickly, looked exactly as pictured (maybe prettier) and fit her beautifully (size 12, her usual size). The straps are a bit too long and bottom will need hemming, but this is true with most dresses of this nature. Alterations will add to cost, but will not be excessive as with some others she tried on at prom shops we visited.

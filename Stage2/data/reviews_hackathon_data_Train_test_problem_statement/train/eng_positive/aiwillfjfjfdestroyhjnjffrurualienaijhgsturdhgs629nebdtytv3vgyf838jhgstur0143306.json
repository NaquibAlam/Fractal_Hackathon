From the beginning of the process the salesperson had a sincere approach that made me trust that my best interest was at heart. Having my case manager, Steve, made a world of difference. He was patient and persistent and adapted to all my needs no matter what challenge arose. I love the media they created and I couldn't have gotten this level of performance at a better price anywhere. Thank you so much and I highly recommend LOGO Scientist and their team!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T13:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T20:50:41.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The book was exactly as described, communications regarding order status excellent, and the packaging was also very good. A bit pricey, but I've been very spoiled in my personal \"finds\", hence the reason for 4 out of 5 stars. I must say that I would much rather choose an antique book in person, but considering my current limitations, I would order from this entity again. I like the fact they have connected sellers from around the nation or globe. I love the fact they generously build libraries where needed. I feel Biblio is a great resource.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T18:22:30.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

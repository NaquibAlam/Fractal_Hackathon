I did not feel it appropriate to have the recipient send me a picture of it, so I am left not knowing what it actually looked like and whether or not it was worth the money. It would be helpful for the florist to send a picture of the arrangement via email to anyone ordering from out of country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:20:17.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I moved to Milan from Brisbane Australia and needed to transfer my AUD over to EUR. My bank uses a sms verification code system to my old Australian number which does not work in Italy which means I wasn't able to simply make an international transfer or any local transfer to my friends and family either for that matter. TransferWise allowed me get all my Euros over and I also saved the two transfer fees I would've been paid if I had done a normal internal money transfer. Very happy. - Thanks guys!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:06:59.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

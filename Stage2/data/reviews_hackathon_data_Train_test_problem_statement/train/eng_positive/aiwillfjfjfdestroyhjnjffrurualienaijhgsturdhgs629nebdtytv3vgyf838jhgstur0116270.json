I placed an order recently and FedEx made a mistake and delivered to the wrong address, I called FedEx and couldn't get it resolved, they claimed that the package was delivered and they pretty much washed their hands on the matter. So I called NorthShore and explained the issue, within 24 hours they shipped the entire order again! This order was over $500 in value and they just reshipped it free of charge. This is incredible customer service if you ask me, way to go NorthShore, you have a loyal customer here for life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T03:28:07.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

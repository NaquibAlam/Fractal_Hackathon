I was happy with both the cars. Their service was excellent. The price offered by Omega is also good. They had an option of a car, where they did not charge for hiring a car for '1-way' (i.e. pick up at Queenstown, and drop at Christchurch). Some other car rental companies were charging $ 200 for the same. They also cooperated after my car-hire with a refund issue that was actually at my bank's end.\nHope they continue with the same spirit! Would surely hire Omega whenever I visit New Zealand again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T13:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T08:08:04.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

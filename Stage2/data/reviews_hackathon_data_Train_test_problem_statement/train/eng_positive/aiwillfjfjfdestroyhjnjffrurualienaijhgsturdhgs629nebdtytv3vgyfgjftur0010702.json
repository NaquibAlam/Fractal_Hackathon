It saved me so much money and time and it was an easy process to buy, register and use. However, some small cons that could have been made better\n1. The pass had to be shown to the station master in order to enter or leave, but it would have been better if there was a more official transaction. There was a time when there was no station master and I had to walk through the gates without a ticket... People were giving me deathstares haha\n2. The pass is a little too big, and cannot fit into any standard pocket.\nThese are small issues and do not impact how awesome it made my experience!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:37:18.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

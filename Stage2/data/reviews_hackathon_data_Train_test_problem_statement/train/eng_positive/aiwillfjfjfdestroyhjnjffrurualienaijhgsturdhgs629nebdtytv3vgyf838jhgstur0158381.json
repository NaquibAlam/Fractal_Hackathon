Less than 24 hours turnaround - I'm impressed especially since I live in regional Victoria.\nMy newly purchased MFC is going well and has, so far, done everything I have asked it to do. And super quick!\nThank you Printzone.\nCheers\nCorinne", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:06:55.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Thrilled she studied the 'super cute outfits' she wore. The hilarity ran high when she found a picture where I myself stood as a young mom with a summer fur checkered pants suit that she herself wore last summer to chill in the garden. As the youngest, just twelve, overjoyed with her just arrived red checkered dress jumps into the room of her big sister to show off the new addition, she is told bluntly that the dress is quite nice, but nothing for her ... little later, big sister showed up to apologize: why she was so blunt, was that she was jealous because she outgrowed those cute dresses ... But since she has the same sizes of her mom, we can go on for ever ;-) !

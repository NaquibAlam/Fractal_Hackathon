He works in environmental education particularly with raptors. We had used Eagle optics binoculars on a trip to Costa Rica with the University of Georgia and really liked the product. After reading more reviews for good quality, moderately priced binoculars, we decided to buy Eagle Optics binoculars for our son. He has bee extremely pleased with them. He has the 10 x 42's and says they are great for spotting raptors fairly far away. I have just ordered a pair for my husband for his birthday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:27:13.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My husband loves this thing. He says it works great and is so easy to use. He's hard to please, but this purchase was spot on. I researched many of these type of spa cleaners, but I think I picked the best. We have had it for a few weeks, so I'm hoping we get continued great use from it. The price was excellent, service and shipping quite good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T16:21:34.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

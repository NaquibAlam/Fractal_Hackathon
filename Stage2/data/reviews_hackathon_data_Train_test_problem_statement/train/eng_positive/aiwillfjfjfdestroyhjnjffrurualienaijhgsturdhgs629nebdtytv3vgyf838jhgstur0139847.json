I can easily call their logos sexy. The only downside, is that the representatives aren't always focused on giving you what you need, or paid for. If you're lucky enough to come across the good ones like Alison, you're in luck, otherwise I suggest you to bring along your patience. They will even go as far as blocking you and deleting any negative review on their Facebook Page. My logo design took almost a week to finish, even though the requests made were minor. I would highly advise anyone who needs an exciting new logo to use the service, just remember to be patient.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:39:29.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

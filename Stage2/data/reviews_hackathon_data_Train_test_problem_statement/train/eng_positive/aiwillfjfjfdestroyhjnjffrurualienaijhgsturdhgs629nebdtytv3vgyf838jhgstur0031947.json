I do wish the boxes contained more fresh vegetables (mushrooms are a fungus, not a vegetable.) I find I recieve way too many onions by the way. I'm a vegetarian, but find the fish and meat (my husband is not a vegetarian) to be of excellent quality. I had to quit the vegetarian box because 1. I could not choose my meals, and 2. I was inundated with mushrooms. (I am highly allergic to them.) I like the classic box, but wish there could be one vegetarian option per week for consideration. Sometimes my box is delayed by a day, so I have to plan a backup meal, just in case. One doesn't find out that a box is not coming, until it doesn't come. This has happened to me on at least 4 occasions. Customer service is great though, and I've recieved discounts for this now minor adjustment to my meal planning. As for taste, I think the meals are great, and I supplement the shortage of vegetables.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:37:47.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

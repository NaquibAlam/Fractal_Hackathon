I appreciated the fact that we had the opportunity to make up to 3 changes before we started getting an additional charge. The web site was great however the graphics review section is a bit limited as far as direction and how to articulate the changes that are needed. I ended up calling for assistance and the representative was somewhat helpful but was able to call someone else to get the direction that we needed. The font size can be adjusted slightly but there is no clear direction on that unless you call. I would probably use them again as the finished product turned out wonderful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T19:48:46.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

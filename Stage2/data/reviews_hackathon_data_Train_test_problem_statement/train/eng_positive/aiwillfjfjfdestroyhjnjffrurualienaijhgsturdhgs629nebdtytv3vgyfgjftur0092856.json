For an annual fee that equates to around 2 nights boarding for our pets, we have access to a huge number of house sitters, who have profiles regarding their experience, reviews from past sits, and in some cases official checks. And they sit for free!\nWe've twice gone away and left our home and pets in the capable hands of free sitters. It saves a fortune, the pets are happier because their routine doesn't need to change, and the house is safe too because it's occupied. Couldn't be happier and would always use this site when we're planning our holidays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:44:59.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I looked at my confirmation receipt and cc charge, I double checked it and it didn't have the hand gauntlet. I called but in my time zone, they were closed so I sent an email. I got up early and called the help desk and the gentleman was very nice and fixed the order for me. Later someone read the email and responded and said that I ordered the complete set. Felt very taken care of everything came quickly and the order was perfect. Love the products and I am a lifetime customer, most comfortable compression garmets I have worn.

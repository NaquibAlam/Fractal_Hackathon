I contacted tails and they advised me to feed her hypoallergenic food to see if that helped. I decided to feed all 3 on the hypoallergenic as they all swop bowls at some point and I have been over the moon with the results, I have complete confidence in this company as they care about your dog and it's isn't about trying to flog you as much they can to you but instead told me to cancel my daily dental chews as they contain ingredient that may cause allergic reactions. This what very honest of them and this is why I would recommend this company to everyone and anyone who would listen.\nTry you won't be disappointed", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:27:07.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

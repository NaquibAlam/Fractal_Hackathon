There were only 3 of us on the trip so it was very small and intimate. Hotel quality and variety was good, especially enjoyed the 'heritage' stays. The food was amazing, whether an upmarket restaurant or from a street stall. Our guide, Parik, was terrific and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great time. Tips - make sure you budget extra for the activities that are offered but not included, we loved the hot air balloon ride over Jaipur and the dinner with a local family in Delhi. Go to India with an open heart and mind and she will reward you with amazing things happening everywhere you look!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T17:30:07.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

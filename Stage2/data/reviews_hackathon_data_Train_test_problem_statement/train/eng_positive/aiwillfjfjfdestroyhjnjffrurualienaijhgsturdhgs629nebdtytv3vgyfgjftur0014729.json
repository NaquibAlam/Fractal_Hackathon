In the intervening months my boyfriend's health declined & he was apprehensive about flying to Melbourne to see the show. We decided to put the tickets on Ticketmaster Resale site, which was a very user friendly site, & I chose to ask the same price as I purchased them. Within a month Ticketmaster advised they had sold the tickets at my price asked & that they would credit my account within 7-14 days of the date of the performance. I was greatly relieved that I would be refunded the price of the tickets & Ticketmaster did refund this full amount into my account. I would have no hesitation in the future booking tickets in advance with Ticketmaster as this almost guarantee of reselling tickets brings confidence and assurance in case life brings changes in one's circumstances. Thanks Ticketmaster for your professionalism. Eleanor", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:34:38.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

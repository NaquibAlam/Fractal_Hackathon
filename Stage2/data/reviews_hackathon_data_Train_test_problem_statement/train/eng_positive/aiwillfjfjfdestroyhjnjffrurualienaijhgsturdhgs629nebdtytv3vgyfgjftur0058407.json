I love the frames I got, the shipping was pretty fast(I only paid for standard shipping and it was still fast), and it was all affordable as well. They also got my prescription perfect, which is a huge plus. Also, their customer service is wonderful. One of the frames I got, (which was a slightly round pair) had the lens sitting a little crooked in the frame on one side and warped the frame a little, which made them look a little lopsided because the other side was perfectly shaped. I had emailed them and asked how to get the screw out of the side of the metal frame so I could just fix the problem myself, I just couldn't get the screw out no matter how hard I tried. They ended up just offering to send me a new pair for free! They blew my expectations away, the quality of all the glasses I purchased was wonderful, other than the 1 mishap which they definitely remedied. I will definitely be buying again because of how great all the styles are, how affordable they are, and the fact that I love to change up my style. Firmoo makes that super easy to do, and they have many really unique styles too, which I love. You'll definitely find at least a few styles that will be perfect for you. They also have nonprescription glasses, and sunglasses too!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T17:11:17.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

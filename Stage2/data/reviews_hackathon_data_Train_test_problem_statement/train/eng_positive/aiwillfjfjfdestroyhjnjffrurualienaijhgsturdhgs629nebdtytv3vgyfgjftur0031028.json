It's supposed to be 80% cotton 20%nylon and yet it feels like paper and is super thin. It's still a beautiful shirt and i will wear it but I don't believe the materials are listed correctly or the item listing accurate. It should state that the fabric is very rough and scratchy not soft as described. I've even washed it 2x with fabric softener before wearing and it did not help.

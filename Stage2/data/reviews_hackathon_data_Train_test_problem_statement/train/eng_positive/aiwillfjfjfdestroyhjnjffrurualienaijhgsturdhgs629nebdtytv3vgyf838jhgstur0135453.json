I enter it and im downloading. Some reviews state they never received a key, or it was sent late. That is definitely not the case with my purchases. Once bought (unless pre-order) you are instantly shown your cd key and an email copy gets sent as well. You can always find your past cd key purchases within your profile. This way you never lose track of them. Many times, they beat the competition on pricing, or are the same. This is my first stop for every online game purchase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:39:04.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The problem included foot discomfort related to nerve damage from rheumatoid arthritis. A gentleman from Kiwi responded within hours, and guided me toward the right sized product to resolve my issues. Better still, he personally selected a pair from inventory to suit my particular concerns. Undoubtedly, Kiwi understands the value in matching their customers with a product that will enhance overall satisfaction.

It keeps me coming back for more.\nAgain, with my favorite customer service agent Athena Yue, who is always on top of any issues that I have to help with the products. She deserves 4 of the 5 stars I give to BangGood. Also thanks to Jeremy Lee, another good technical support I recently know.\nOnly one concern I have is the new shipping fee this year but it seems to me it happens to all other Chinese businesses too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T17:58:18.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

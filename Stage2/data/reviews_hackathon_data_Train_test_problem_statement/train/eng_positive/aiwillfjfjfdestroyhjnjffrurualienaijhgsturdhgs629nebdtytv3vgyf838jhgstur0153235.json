We got a groupon for $25 for 4 meals, we would spend that, probably not the $60 retail =) BUT, this was not just great food, it was sooo fun. I was not expecting the cute apron, what a fun surprise! We have fish in orange sauce over couscous. AWESOME!! Love the recipe, not something I would have thought of. Introduced us to a new spice. The \"chef tip\" is great too. Outside of price we loved every single thing about this. We also got pepper steak, it was a gorgeous cut of meat and we are snobby about our beef, beautiful marbling. If the price fits your budget, this is fun, quick and oh so tasty! Great job guys!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T14:30:38.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

You really cant get the same kind of quality of clothes for the great prices that they have plus the cute outfits that they have are amazing....I used to buy nike addidas and under armor but it was way to expensive and wasn't as cute or great on prices. All in all I have nothing bad to say about Fabletics themselves other then there customer service 2 times but I'm sure they're dealing with that.

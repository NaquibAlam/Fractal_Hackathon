Entering the required IMEI number and paying was easy enough, but then I did not hear back from iPhoneIMEI for ~ 3 days, at which point I got an email confirming that they were still working on it. It wasn't until day 4 confirmed that I got the email that the phone was unlocked and was able to insert the new sim card without a hitch. Overall it was a smooth enough process, I just wish iPhoneIMEI kept me more updated throughout the process and I had started the process earlier had I know how long it would take.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:16:52.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

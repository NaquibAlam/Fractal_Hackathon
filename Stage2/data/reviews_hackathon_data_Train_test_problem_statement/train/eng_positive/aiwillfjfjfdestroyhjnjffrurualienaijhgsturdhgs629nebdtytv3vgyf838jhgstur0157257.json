The bacon crisped perfectly when microwaved. Very good bun; did not become soggy. Also, important to us, the meat was flavored perfectly, not too salty. When I thought we might have been forgotten in delivery, I was able to contact someone who was able to tell me that our food was just ten minutes away. Very courteous delivery man. I do wish the delivery time could be within one hour rather than two (5-6 or 6-7 instead of 5-7). It's hard to wait that long when you're hungry.

(Yes, it is also yellow and black in colour!) The price was amazing too. Very little assembly required and it started first pull of the cord the first time it was used. My 13 year old grandson was the first to use it and he, and it, did a great job getting through the tough kikuyu grass and the dreaded carrot weed. The after sales service from Trade Tested was good as they followed up with an email checking to see if I was happy with my lawnmover. Excellent service and I would recommend TradeTested to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:15:51.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

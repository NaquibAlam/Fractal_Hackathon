I feel for the cost of shipping was good but the time for it to be delivered could have been better. I tracked the package coming from Florida to Maryland and it went clear past all the way to Chicago before back tracking to Maryland. Not really something that can be controlled nor was it my reason for only 4 stars.. My reason is the packaging was below average. Item had some Knicks and scratches for there was no packing materials within. Items were simply put in box and sent out. My recommendation is to add some bubble wrap or newspaper...idk something. Spent over 300 bucks but seemed to lack care in packing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:04:39.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

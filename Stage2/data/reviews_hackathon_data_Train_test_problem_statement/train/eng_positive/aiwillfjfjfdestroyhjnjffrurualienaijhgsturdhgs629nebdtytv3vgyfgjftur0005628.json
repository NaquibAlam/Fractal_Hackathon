I then received a phone call from the fitter letting me know he was on his way around 20 minutes before his arrival.\nWhen he arrived, he was extremely helpful and explained to me that I had been driving around with the wrong size tyres (fitted at my last MOT) which had caused the excessive wear on my rear tyres.\nThe fitting itself was zero hassle, the fitter got on with the job straight away and just let me know when he had finished.

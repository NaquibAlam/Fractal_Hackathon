That's why Munchery is so good! It's fresh food and it tastes great. The portions are just right, they aren't huge like a restaurant where you can over eat and not small that it leaves you unsatisfied. They work hard to deliver in the time window required and the price is affordable for city food. I got the Beef Picadillo bowl, which was amazing. So much flavor!

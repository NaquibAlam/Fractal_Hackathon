Served it with roast sweet potato, green beans and a medley of roasted veg (carrot, fresh beetroot, cherry Tom's, etc).\nGuest 1 absolutely loved it\nGuest 2 liked it lots, once she got over what it was.\nWife loved it.\nMe Sorry Kezie.... I'd eat it again, but not my thing. That's a personal choice, much like the fact my wife doesn't like pork.\n6 year old daughter (next day) loved it.\nI'll need to order it again, as my neighbours want to try it, so I will, and I'll eat it.\nHow does it taste? Agree with the chicken comparison, therefore it easily goes with garlicky butter, and probably loads of other stuff.\nTexture? Coarser than chicken, but ours was still tender I'm a fantastic chef (lol joking.... I'm just about competent)\nOverall verdict if you have the gumption to order it, you'll eat it. It may not be your thing, but my guests liked it, so you should try it.\nFantastically easy to order, and really fast. Go on you know you should try it bloody he'll I sound like an advert now I'm not so I'll shut up piece said.\nThank you Kezie for a nice twist on our dinner party.\nJulian", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T23:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:28:03.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

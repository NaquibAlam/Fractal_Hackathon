The package was sent very quickly with nothing missing from an order which included a few extras. The extras (cover, hose joining kit) were reasonably priced too.\nThe product was quickly installed....but make sure you have a 12 mm drill bit in your kit! The whole lot went in within 15minutes and looks great. It functions as advertised. No leaks and very easy to handle.\nIf I need any other equipment in this line, I wouldn't hesitate to order from hoselink again.\nRick, Launceston Tasmania", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T13:45:32.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

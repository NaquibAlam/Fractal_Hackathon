I felt very skeptical reading all the blogger reviews because most of them received free pairs from the company, and we all know sponsored posts tend to be less than honest. However, I decided to go ahead and order anyway because I really needed a new pair of glasses and they were having a buy 1 get 1 free promo. Plus, their designs are so cute!\nBefore ordering, I messaged customer service asking them if they could get my package sent here before Feb 18. A CSR replied within 24 hrs telling me they could expedite my order and sure enough my package got here in about 10 days! I received 2 pairs of vintage eyeglasses and each came with a hard leather case, microfiber cloth, soft drawstring case and a small screwdriver tool. I was so impressed with the quality of the products I got!\nThe only constructive criticism I can offer would probably be that their website needs a little more work. It looks sketchy at first because the design is very basic. The try-on feature is a nice touch, though, and I appreciate that they provide complete details for each frame which made it easy for me to pick something that would fit my face.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T17:12:06.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was hesitant to purchase because I couldn't find a lot of reviews or further info. The seats came in and were absolutely wonderful. I set to installing and the instructions were easy - I had no issues with installation. However, once we started driving around - we had an issue. The seats were large for the space within the truck - and it's a big truck. They were very high up, which resulted in the top corner rubbing against the seatbelt installed on the truck wall. My wife is shorter then I and the very high ride height meant she really had to reach to get at the pedals.\nI contacted Shop4Seats - and I got Richard Valdez who right away asked me to email pictures and he'd speak with the shop. I figured they'd just say sorry - that's just how they are. But no, Richard got back to me saying they understood the problem, and they thought they could solve it with a new frame style underneath - and they'd send me the frame right away. The new frame arrived promptly and I set to work. It was the right idea, but unfortunately did not fit over this diesel's big transmission hump in the truck.\nBy now, Richard and I had been going back and forth a few times for 2 months as holidays delayed my trials and errors. In the end I had to send back the seats and stick with my old ones, and Richard helped arrange the return with FedEx. The seat construction was great - instructions were fine, it was just a struggle with the base frame and this truck. All the while I could work with Richard Valdez like he was there with me. I couldn't have asked for a better experience, despite the issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:28:23.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

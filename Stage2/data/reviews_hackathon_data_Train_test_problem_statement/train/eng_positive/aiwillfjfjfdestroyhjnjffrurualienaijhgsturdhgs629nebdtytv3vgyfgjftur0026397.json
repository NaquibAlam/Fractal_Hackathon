I submitted a pre sales ticket and everything and waited for a response. After a quick read on their website I found out that they do not answer on weekends but only Mon-Fri.\nAnyways, I was a bit bored and kept searching online to find other alternatives, although I didn't expect anyone to work on a weekend.\nThen I found orderingonlinesystem.com. I said ok let me check their stuff. Was cool and then a chat box appeared on the bottom right corner. I though naaah, it will be just like these offline chat that you have to insert your email, name and message and they will contact you after 1 day or so.\nBUT, it was freaking online! Jesus I was actually speaking with a person! And guess who! The co founder himself, Alonso his name!\nHe took me through his whole product. He answered more than 30 questions after I was saying to him last question, last question etc. His patience with me was incredible! After chatting for about 2 hours ( 2 FREAKING HOURS) I did take a break to think.\nAnd instantly after a few minutes I decided to purchase his product. I received two online forms to fill which I had a few questions and Alonso was there to help me even fill the form!\nSo It is amazing the fact he helped me even before I was his customer! Now that I am, I instantly felt that I have someone next to me to support me :D\nThank you so much and I am very much looking forward to use your software!\nThank you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T18:48:01.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

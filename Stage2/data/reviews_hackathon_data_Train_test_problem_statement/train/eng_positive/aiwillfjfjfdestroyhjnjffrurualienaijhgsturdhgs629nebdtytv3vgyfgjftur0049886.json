Many years ago while in Arles I bought placemats and napkins in different colors but the same pattern/print (Calissons) and I had been searching for a coordinating tablecloth. Marche Provence sent me an email letting me know that they were waiting for the material from France and offered to send me a substitute product. I decided to wait and I'm glad I did. The tablecloth is beautiful and very well made. I've bookmarked Marche Provence's website so I can place future orders.

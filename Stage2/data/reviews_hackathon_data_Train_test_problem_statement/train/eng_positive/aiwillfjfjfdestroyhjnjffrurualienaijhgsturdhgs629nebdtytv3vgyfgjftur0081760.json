It really seems to be true that Americans don't know how to drive in those. I've learnt that from past experience, seeing someone go clockwise around the circle and people not using signals (although that is a common problem elsewhere too), and people actually parking in the circle. I tend to honk my horn to these crazy people to let them know they are doing something dangerous in a traffic circle.\nAnyway, iDriveSafely also seems to be unsure how to drive in a traffic circle. Your instructions tell of two different procedures of signaling when it comes to entering/exiting the traffic circle. Is it also correct in the US to signal when you're exiting, and ONLY when you're exiting? This is the best practice to avoid any collisions in the traffic circle, especially with pedestrians which is the most common case, and I hope driving schools can get this in people's heads.\nThis is my only gripe with the website.\nThanks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:06:27.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

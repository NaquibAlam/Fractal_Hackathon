The ONLY option is taking out full protection. Peace of mind when renting.\nI have had to lay a claim to have my excess refunded recently and I was astounded at the efficient and totally professional manner in which the claim was assessed and concluded. Exceptional communication from the agent involved.\nAs long as you have all the documents requested, there was literally only a day or so that the claim took to be concluded.\nCustomer for life, and I will make sure everyone I know rents a car the same way I do!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:50:34.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

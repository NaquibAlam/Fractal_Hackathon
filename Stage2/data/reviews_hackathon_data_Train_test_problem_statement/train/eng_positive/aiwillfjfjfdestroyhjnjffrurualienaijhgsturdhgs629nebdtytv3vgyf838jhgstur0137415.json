So, on a whim, I ordered a 2 lb. live lobster so I could tide myself over before I get up to the coast. I've never ordered a live animal shipped to me, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but the process was super easy. I loved the ability to select my arrival date for convenience. The lobster got here alive and fresh and went straight from the box into the pot. It tasted great and I'll be ordering again soon!

Your order will send you a confirmation and a tracking number. The product was 100% authentic, even cross referenced with the Tom Ford store because I hate being jipped. They came with everything they would in the store. Definitely a legitimate site and a good product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:09:12.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

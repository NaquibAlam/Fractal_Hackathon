Before Hello Fresh, it was Hello Drive Thrus and Hello Take-Out 7 days a week. Hello Fresh has afforded me several positive things. First, I am learning to cook \"real\" food like I would get at a restaurant. Second, my niece is a budding chef so she loves to sleepover and help me cook a meal. Third, I have gotten 4 people to join already because of how much I am enjoying the food and learning how to cook...which saves me even more money on future boxes! That's why I think you should change the name from HELLO FRESH to HELLO AWESOME!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:54:35.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

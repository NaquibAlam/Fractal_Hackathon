Luckily, I found Express to Russia, which made the process simple and fast -- even managing to correct a mistaken address and a change of flight plans at the last moment. I'm especially grateful to Josephine in the San Francisco office, who took great pains to be sure I submitted everything needed and received the visa even quicker than predicted.

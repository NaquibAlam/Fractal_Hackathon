I contacted multiple and some companies would not even donate to me, BUT Queensboro went above and beyond my expectations. Fred the founder started to help me and then Craig ended finishing out helping me with my donation. Queensboro ended up not donating just 1 but 4 Polos to me. I paid nothing for it. I highly recommend Queensboro, they are professional, kind, helpful and amazing. I have not received the shirts yet but I won't complain because they have been extremely generous to me. Thank You Queensboro, You Are The Best!! :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:16:39.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

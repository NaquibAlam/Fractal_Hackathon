But no need to worry OFX has it very well controlled and is extremely reliable and efficient. The only thing that really bugs me about OFX is that they make me use an old email address which was changed because of a scam. They send emails to my new address but insist on me using the old email address for internet connection. Everybody else lets me change my email address except OFX they refuse to allow me to get rid of my corrupted email address. That does worry me. After all I am doing money transactions not just social chatting with OFX so I'm thinking about looking into using some other organization to do my international money transfers with. Sure your staff can tell me it isn't a safety issue but there are no guarantees and if it is something that upsets me then why does OFX force me to do something that I don't want to. Don't I have a choice what password I use? I can change passwords with everybody else. I resent being FORCED to leave my old email address for access. I WANT TO CHANGE IT. I said could I cancel my OFX account and start a new one and the lady said - NO, YOU'LL STILL HAVE TO USE YOUR OLD EMAIL ADDRESS. I don't want to use my old internet address to do the transaction on line SO I RING UP OFX INSTEAD. Why is that good for OFX to have people ringing up when they are happy to do it online but not happy to use a corrupted email address? It stinks, like I have no rights. I WANT TO USE MY NEW EMAIL ADDRESS TO DO ONLINE TRANSFERS. I'm the customer why aren't my choices respected. Why are you the only ones who force me to do something I don't want to?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T07:08:29.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was struggling with no water getting through due to kinks in the hose. At the tap there was water squirting out. When my nephew arrived he said to me \"get a hose link\" Aunty Liz I've got one and I brought one for my son for his new house. Best thing I've done. So with that I went on line and I've never looked back. I just love the ease of this hose. People don't struggle with that old hose anymore. That's all I can say.\nLiz King", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:31:56.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Whey they got back to me, I was surprised with their quality of work. So thorough and understands what I wanted from proofreading. However, I was surprised with a minimum fee they require for a decent (not short) turnaround like 24 hours or even 48hours when I came back to request second work. They basically said my writing is below minimum word count and charge me 1.5x of what I was supposed to pay first place. They should state the minimum word count and extra charges clearly, so customers don't have to be surprised at the end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T23:12:51.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

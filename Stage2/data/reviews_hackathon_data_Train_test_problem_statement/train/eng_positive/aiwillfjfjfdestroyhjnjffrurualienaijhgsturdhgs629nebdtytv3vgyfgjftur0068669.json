We ordered the first shower door and it arrived about 1 week later in excellent condition and installation went very smoothly. As the work progressed, we ordered the second shower door that wound up broken while at the carrier's location. The carrier notified Faucet Town USA and us that it was being returned. Faucet Town immediately sent a replacement door that arrived a few days later in great condition. However, during installation, one of the door panels shattered as it was being put in place. We notified Faucet Town and, after sending them a couple of photos of the damage, they have already started the process to ship a replacement panel at no cost to me! I will definitely be contacting Faucet Town in a few weeks when we are ready to do the work in the third and final bathroom. Robin, with Faucet Town's customer service, is most helpful and available to answer questions. Great vendor to work with!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:56:12.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Delivered on the day they projected. I used their measuring guide for size. My daughter measured a sz 4 chest, 10 waist and 0 hip. (She's 14 yo and only 4\"10, about 100#). I ordered the sz 10 and it was a great fit in the waist. I'm told that is the hardest part to fit and you can only take it in. Anyway, we just had to shorten the straps and hem the bottom, which we would have had to do on any dress we purchased. Very pretty dress, just as pictured. Very happy with the transaction and that it came from the US. I would definitely order from them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:58:13.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

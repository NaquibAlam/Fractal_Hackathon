The telematics device they install in your car has made me a safer driver by making me more aware of how I was driving and of the speeds I was doing.\nIt also allowed me to get my daughter driving as their prices are very affordable.\nI think it's a must for any parent who has a son or daughter driving, as they can monitor their driving, as you receive a weekly text showing you your driving scores and show's if you were speeding. That way you can stop their speeding habit before anything bad happens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:07:57.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

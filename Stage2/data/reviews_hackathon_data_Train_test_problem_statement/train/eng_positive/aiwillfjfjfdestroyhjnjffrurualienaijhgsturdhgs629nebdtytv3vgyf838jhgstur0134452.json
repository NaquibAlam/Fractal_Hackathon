I finally decided it was time to try it on my own! Overall, I enjoyed the website, it was easy to use. I loved that they had outfits already picked out, they have every type of workout clothes anyone could want. My big dislike was that a lot of sizes (not just my size), were sold out! I found that frustrating, however, there were many other choices to chose from. I ended up going slightly overboard with my first order, mainly because I wanted the great intro prices and I wanted to try on a large amount of their clothing to really get a good feel for it. I saved a ton of money and I can't wait for my March 2nd delivery!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:14:25.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

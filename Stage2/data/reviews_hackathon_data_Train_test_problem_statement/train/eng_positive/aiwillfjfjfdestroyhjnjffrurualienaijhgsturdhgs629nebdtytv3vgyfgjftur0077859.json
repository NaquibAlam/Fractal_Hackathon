Two and half years later this is still true. A small team in a global network can often feel isolated but working at the Norwest offices has given our staff a great sense of being in a larger office community, with Servcorp's team of Receptionists, Secretaries and Office Managers active members of the Purolite team. A great place to base your operation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:11:23.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

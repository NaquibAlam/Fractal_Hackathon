I racked up both my credit cards due to unemployment, getting a new place, Christmas gifts etc. I was paying 200 plus every month on both my cards, the amount just kept going up and up due to interest. At David Sklar and associates they helped me find an accurate plan that was suited to my needs and was realistic in price based on how much monthly income I make.

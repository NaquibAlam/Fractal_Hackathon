I was guided on how to make sure my claim would be approved and given great advice on what to do and where to go for care. The claims process has been smooth and the follow up by Fast Cover has been fantastic. I have recently taken out coverage with them again for my trip to Bali. I wouldn't use anyone else now, and neither will my family.

It was delivered on time. The Volcano and accessories worked properly as soon as we set it up. The website was easy to navigate and pay. The Planet of the Vapes personnel kept in touch with us through email and that let us know that we were taken care of the entire way, from purchase to delivery! I would recommend The Planet of the Vapes website to all my friends! A little added bonus was the price and the free accessories it came with. A free Planet of the Vapes grinder (aluminum) and small Tightvac container. Also included for free is an awesome all metal outside and soft foam padded inside Volcano carrying case. We are very pleased with our purchase!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T15:28:26.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

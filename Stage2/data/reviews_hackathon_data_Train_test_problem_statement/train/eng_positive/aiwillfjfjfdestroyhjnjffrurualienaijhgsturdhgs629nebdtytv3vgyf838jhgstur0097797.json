We couldn't be happier! From picking out our bedroom set to buying it and having it delivered and set up everything went quickly and smoothly. I couldn't ask for more and I absolutely love everything. Our salesman Steve went above and beyond. We did have one tiny little issue with a knob being bent but I was able to chat with Joe and he sent a new one out to me immediately. Thank you to everyone for making it a wonderful experience as always! You have a customer for life with me!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:28:42.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

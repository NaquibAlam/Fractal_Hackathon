There is easy access to the ports, and the control buttons work very well with the case\nIt's made of high quality material and is both flexible and rigid enough in the right places to easily slip onto the phone while still fitting tightly.\nThe case finish makes the phone easy to grip and is as simple as can be design wise but that's exactly my preference.\nOverall a great case to have to protect your Moto G3.\nI am not a paid reviewer and I did not receive a discount or preferential treatment for writing this review. I just like to share my experience as this case deserves a top mark.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:18:15.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

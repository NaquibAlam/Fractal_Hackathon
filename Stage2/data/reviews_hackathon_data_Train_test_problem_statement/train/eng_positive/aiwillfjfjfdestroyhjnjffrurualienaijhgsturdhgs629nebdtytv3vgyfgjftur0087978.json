Reading the information when the pump arrived I realized I had made a mistake and requested that I be allowed to return it. I had to pay the return shipping charges $45 but it was better than losing the whole $117.68 I had paid for the unit. I was treated courteous and friendly by your staff and was advised to return the unit immediately to avoid any further charges. I did so and the cost was credited to my Master Card the next day after it was received. I am very confident now that I am dealing with a reputable pool supply source and will not hesitate to do business with them again in the future. As for the pump that is working right now I fixed my problem by lubricating the motor bearing. That may be a short term fix but if I need to buy a new one, now I know where to go for sure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:08:02.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

While there is no equal to Brother genuine ink I am very pleased with the quality of the generic ink and the ease of which the other Brother machine used it. I searched many sites and regular retail stores before purchasing from Ink Station, their prices on genuine and generic inks are very competitive. Delivery is amazingly fast. I ordered on a Saturday afternoon and the ink was at my door on Monday! Can't praise this company enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:34:38.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

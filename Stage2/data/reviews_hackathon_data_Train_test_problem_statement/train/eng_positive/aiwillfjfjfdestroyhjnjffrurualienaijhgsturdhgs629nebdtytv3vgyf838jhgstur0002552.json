The vape I got \"Flowermate V5.0S Pro\" and wow it is amazing. The heat up time is nothing, it came much faster than I was expecting, and it heats up everything inside perfectly. I honestly love this thing. I've been telling all my friends that it is the best purchase I've made in quite some time.\nIf you are on the fence about this vape (or any of the vapes here), go ahead and get it.

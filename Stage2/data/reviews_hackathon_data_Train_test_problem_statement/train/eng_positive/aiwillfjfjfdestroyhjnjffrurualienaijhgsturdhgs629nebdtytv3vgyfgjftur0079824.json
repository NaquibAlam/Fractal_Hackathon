We picked up and dropped off the car at Wellington Airport. All pick up and drop off instructions were as described. I had to use a car seat (free) for a toddler and had asked for the harness to be put through the top slots as in my car at home. This was done and I was able to pop the tired toddler straight into his seat with no adjustments needed. Thankyou. Would not hesitate to use Omega again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:52:18.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

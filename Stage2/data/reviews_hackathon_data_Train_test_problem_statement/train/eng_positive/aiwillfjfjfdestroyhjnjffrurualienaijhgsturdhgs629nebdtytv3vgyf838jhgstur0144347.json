I would say it takes 3-4 weeks minimum if you print out the prepaid shipping label. When your package arrives you get notified it arrives and then they email you to let you know if they are accepting your books. If they are sending you a check you will receive an email but the check gets send via regular mail so it will be a few days until you receive a check. So if you are in a rush this is not the service you want to use but if you are willing to wait patiently then this is the service for you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:10:46.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

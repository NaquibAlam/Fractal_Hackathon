He was the right guy for the job. He selected a memorable, adventorous, classy package for me and my roommate. Wow, the hotels, excursions, and English speaking guides were all 5 star! Some of the most memorable moments was the floating market in Bangkok, the Grand Palace and the beach getaway in Koh Samui. Paul was a guide we had in Chaing Mai who was phenomenal... I am very big on reviews and experiencing strong customer service and experience and I really feel all was executed here. Of course, everyone in Thailand said we had the best Karma due to how great the weather was and no flight delays haha! But as long as you go with an open mind and roll with what's handed to you, expect a brilliant time with Go Away.\nFeedback- you may pay a little more for a private tour or more glamorious hotel experience but it is so worth it!\nDana Simon", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T19:49:17.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

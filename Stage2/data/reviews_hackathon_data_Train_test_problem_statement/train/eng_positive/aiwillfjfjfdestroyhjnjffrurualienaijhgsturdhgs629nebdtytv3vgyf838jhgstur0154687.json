We chose the self-drive Castle Tour and it was absolutely amazing. The customer service was excellent and the accommodations were all great. My favorites were Waterford Castle, Ballyseede Castle and Ashford Castle. They were able to adjust the itinerary so we could spend a few extra days at Ballyseede to do a wedding blessing ceremony. I highly reccomend this company and would definitely book with them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:48:32.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

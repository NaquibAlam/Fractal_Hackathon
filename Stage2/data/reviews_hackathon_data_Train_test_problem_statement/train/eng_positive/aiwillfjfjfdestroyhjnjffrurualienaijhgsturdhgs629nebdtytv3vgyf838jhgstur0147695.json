I am new to Ocean County and had a really good Vet where I lived in central New Jersey. So I was very reluctant to switch but had no choice because I live in Whiting now. Found Ocean County Vet. Hospital in the phone book. Called and got an appointment and took Chico to see the Doctor last week. She examined him and then cut his nails and trimmed his wings. I was very pleased with the Vet Hospital and with the Doctor. I think she said her name was Dr. Jenna K. Very happy - will definitely return for Chico's follow-up visits.

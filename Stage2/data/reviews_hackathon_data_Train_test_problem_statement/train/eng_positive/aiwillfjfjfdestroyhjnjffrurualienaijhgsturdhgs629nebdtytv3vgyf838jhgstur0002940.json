It's mostly cheap and there is a big catalog of products. As with most shopping from china it might take some time before the packages arrive in my mailbox, but for the most part all my orders have arrived 1-2 weeks after order date. This I would guess is mostly because the slow customs in Norway.\nAll in all I recommend Banggood!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T05:47:44.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

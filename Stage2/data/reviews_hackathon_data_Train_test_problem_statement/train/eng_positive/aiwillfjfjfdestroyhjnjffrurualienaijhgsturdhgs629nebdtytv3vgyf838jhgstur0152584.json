One, because I found the site so easy to use. Two, because I was so excited to find copies of books that were so special to me, personally, but which had been lost when my home was damaged. Three, for how reasonable the prices were. Four, for the shipping being both reasonable in price, and quick in delivery. And Five, because the quality of the (well used) books was as good if not better than my original copies.\nThank you Thrift Book. You are a treasure of a resource.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T23:07:44.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

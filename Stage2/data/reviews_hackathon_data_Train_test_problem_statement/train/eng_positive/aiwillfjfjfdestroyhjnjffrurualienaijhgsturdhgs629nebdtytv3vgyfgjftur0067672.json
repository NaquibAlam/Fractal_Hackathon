The prices were the first thing which attracted me to Web EyeCare. This site had the cheapest prices of any other retailer that I could find. Secondly, they had her exact prescription in stock. The contacts shipped the same day that I ordered them. We received the contacts within 4 days and upon using these contacts, my daughter was very pleased. She said that she could see clearly, and did not have a need for rewetting drops! She was a happy camper and so was my purse!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:00:37.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

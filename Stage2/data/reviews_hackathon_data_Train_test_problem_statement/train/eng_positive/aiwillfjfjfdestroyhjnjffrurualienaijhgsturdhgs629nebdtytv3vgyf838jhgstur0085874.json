PropertyNow made the process that much easier and I found the brochure to be particularly useful. Website is intuitive. It was also easy to edit the ad and the changes were quickly updated on allhomes. Enquiries were sent straight to my email for follow up. It would have cost me more just to advertise privately on Allhomes with only a 9 month timeframe but with PropertyNow I got all the other benefits of their service as well. Would definitely recommend using them if you are planning on selling privately.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T17:50:56.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

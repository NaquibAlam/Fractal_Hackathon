Battered and loved copies have a special place on my shelf and you can't beat the prices and shipping. However, I am consistently annoyed by two things: the library wrappings and the Thrift Book stickers are not removed and decrease quality. I don't mind receiving old library books, but I think it makes sense for Thrift Books to cut off the plastic wrap and stickers or require their sellers to do so when someone purchases the copy. As a consumer, I don't know why it's my job. What's even more annoying is their own stickers - why, oh why, would you put a garage sale-esque sticker on the spine of a book that cannot be cleanly removed?! I don't want sticky gunk remaining on my novels. These details aside, I will continue to purchase from them. Hopefully these courtesies can be addressed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:13:17.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

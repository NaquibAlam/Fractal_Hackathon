Had contact by phone and e mail with 2 dealerships Parkway Derby who were slow to respond and Johnsons VW Tamworth who were exceptionally proactive to find the exact car i wanted, i.e. Colour, auto and with panoramic sunroof. Using the Carwow dealership offer agreement on PX of my own car was made and we were away. Took delivery today 1 march 2017. Carwow experience excellent, and the same for Johnsons VW. Will se carlow again in future and would not hesitate to recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:49:10.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After one day had a problem with the auto lock on the drivers side door. Rang Kerwin at Redspot in Mackay who told me to bring it back to the airport (only a short drive for me) and would swap vehicles. Arrived and was upgraded to a Toyota Altice. Kerwin was a very decent young man who could not been more helpful. Very impressed with the service. Returned vehicle to the airport on the 16th March to very nice young woman.

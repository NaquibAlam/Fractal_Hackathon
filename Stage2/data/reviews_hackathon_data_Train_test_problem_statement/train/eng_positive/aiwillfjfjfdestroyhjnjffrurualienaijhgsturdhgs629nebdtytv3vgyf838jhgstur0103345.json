First time we had a brand new Fiesta and had no issues whatsoever, second time we went to the next level of car for an extra 3 Euros and when we arrived at the Car Rental office we were informed that we had been upgraded (for free) to a Fiat 500L which is one of the finest cars I have ever driven in my 48 years. The staff are very friendly and efficient and I have no hesitation in recommending Centauro Torrevieja to anyone who will listen. We look forward to hiring a car from them again maybe next time I will get an upgrade to a Porsche 911 (you can always dream)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T14:09:16.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

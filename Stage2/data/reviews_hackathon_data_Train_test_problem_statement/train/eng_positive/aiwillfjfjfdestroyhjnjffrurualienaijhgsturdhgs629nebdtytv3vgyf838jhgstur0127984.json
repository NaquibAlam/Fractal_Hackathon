We could get a very small part of one bar standing by a window or going out on the deck. I have been so frustrated by being told there is nothing you can do. ATT said we can get a booster on our main tower and amplify the signal in your direction, we will email you when that is done. We are still waiting for that to happen. Well now that we purchased the amplifier from Wilson, our cell signal went straight to 4 strong bars. Really happy thank you Wilson's", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:40:30.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Everything was delivered as promised. The itinerary covered everything we wanted to see and was set at just the right pace. The riads were absolutely lovely; no complaints on choices at all. And our driver, Hamid, was very knowledgeable about the history of Morocco which was an added benefit; plus an excellent driver (he safely got us through a snowstorm in the mountains!!). He was extremely pleasant, accommodating, and our enjoyment and experience of Morocco was his number one priority. No hesitations recommending Hamid to other visitors! While we tend to visit countries on our own, Morocco is one that you will want to have a driver as the roads can be tricky (both driving and road signs) and you will miss 90% of everything if you are trying to navigate. Our only complaint is that we wish Experience It Tours offered tours in other countries too as they are just that good!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T14:36:28.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

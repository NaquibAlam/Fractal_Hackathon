They have a great selection of some of my favorite designers. I check their site every morning when I get to work to see if there is anything new and sadly for my wallet, there is :P Despite having my order come from Canada to the NY metro area, it still arrives SO quickly. The only upset I've come across with ssense is that they sell out of some items so quickly, sometimes overnight before I even get a chance to see the item has become available on their site. Obviously not their own fault, but it would be nice to be notified when new merch is posted especially by designers that I am an avid buyer of. Other than that, seriously it is great", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:00:31.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

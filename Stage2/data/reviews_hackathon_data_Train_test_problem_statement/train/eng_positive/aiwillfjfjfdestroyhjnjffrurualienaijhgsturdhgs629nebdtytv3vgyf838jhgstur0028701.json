If there was ever a problem with an order they got back to me faster than I expected (emails, etc.) and resolved my problem, shipping an item, refunding me, etc. Though I rarely have any problems.\nThey were extremely friendly and the prices are fantastic.\nI recommend them to my friends and family. I did more than half of my Christmas shopping on here and will continue to use them!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T13:32:44.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

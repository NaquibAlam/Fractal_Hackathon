Great selections included in the box. Was a little unsure on some of the wines included but spoke with Will and he was an absolute pleasure to deal with. He has such great knowledge of his wines and was more than happy to share it with you. He gave a full and detailed response to any concerns I had despite it being a busy week (mothers day). Service was so good I ordered another case and look forward to seeing whats inside and sampling the many and varied selections. Will and his team do a great job and I look forward to dealing with them again in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:07:41.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

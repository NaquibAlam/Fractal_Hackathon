I was leery of purchasing a big ticket item from an online store. After this shopping experience, I will only purchase electronics from IElectrica from now on. We did our research and the reviews were the reason we felt safe to go ahead and make the purchase. The price can't be beat! And to have a 5-year warranty for half the price? We're so thrilled with our purchase, from ordering to delivery, everything was so smooth.

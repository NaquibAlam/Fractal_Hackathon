At first I was a little suspicious as the Lightmeter wasn't even listed on the Sekonic website yet. Also the the low price made me suspicious. However I gave it ago! I am super positively surprized how soon I recieved the parcel. Everything was well packaged and the price is amazing. CT kept me updated about the shipping too.\nI was also positively suprised at the review feelback. When reading a review from a disapointed customer the CameraTools team always gave feedback with an explanation. It's the first time i see this and for me is a sign of good service. This somehow was like an insurance to know I'm dealing with a serious and professional team.\nI will definately buy here again.

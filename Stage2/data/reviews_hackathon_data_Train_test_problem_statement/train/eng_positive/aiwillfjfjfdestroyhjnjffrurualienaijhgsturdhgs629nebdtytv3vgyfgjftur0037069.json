I did an online search for computer recycling places and came to this one. Did the online checklist, packaged up my Macbook Pro and sent it off to GoRoostr using their prepaid FedEx shipping label. As soon as they received and inspected my computer I received instant payment in my Paypal account that same day. A big thank you to Jon who was in contact with me through the whole process.

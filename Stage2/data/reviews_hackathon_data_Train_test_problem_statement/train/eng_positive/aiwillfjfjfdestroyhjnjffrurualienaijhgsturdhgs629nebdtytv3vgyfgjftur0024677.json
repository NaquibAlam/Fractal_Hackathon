I cracked the screen and it was completely black, I took it in to one of the locations right before I went to work and it was done by the time I went to lunch. The phone is good as new and looks perfect. I was very pleased about the turn around time and the price wasn't bad considering how much it would cost to get a replacement and lose all the data on my phone. I did have a problem connecting to WiFi, so I took it back in the next day. Again, they were done in just a few hours and although they weren't able to fix it (it ended up being a firmware issue), I know the employee helping me did everything he could think of and didn't charge me anything to try and fix it. He called multiple places and looked online to try and help me repair the issue. Very professional business and while I hope I won't have to use them again, I wouldn't hesitate to if I needed another phone or tablet repaired. I've already told all my friends that I highly recommend FoxPaw, I wouldn't even try going anywhere else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:30:36.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Every single piece I ordered arrived in great condition and wrapped nicely. Of course I recomment when one is ordering clothing that they check the details and size chart thoroughly, if done correctly you shouldn't be disappointed with your order! Also the reviews that many customers have left have helped tremendously and has encouraged me to continue shopping here. I should also add that the prices are reasonable and not as expensive as other online stores! Every time I find a piece I love from somewhere else I always come to yesstyle and see if they have any products of the same style and they always end up being better than the original for me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T11:08:02.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

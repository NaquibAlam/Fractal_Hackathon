Ordered boots- they arrived the next day! Boots unfortunately were too small but when I got in touch with them they contacted supplier to see if they could source my size. Size completely out of stock. So I had to return them (free) and I was refunded within 2 days. This was what I would call a perfect service. If I tried shoes that I knew fit in a shop now I would nearly go home and order from Walsh shoes online their service is so good!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:07:35.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

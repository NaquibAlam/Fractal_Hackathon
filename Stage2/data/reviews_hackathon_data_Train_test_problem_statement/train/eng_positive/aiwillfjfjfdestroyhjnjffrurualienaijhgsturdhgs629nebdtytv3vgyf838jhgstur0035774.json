I tried the small sample pack first and really loved the underwear I ordered. I am a plus size person and the XL in the Maximum Overnight fit perfect and didn't leak. I also have tried Always Maximum overnight and they leaked a little. I now have a terrible cold and the coughing and sneezing cause a lot of leakage so am wearing the Always underwear during the day some times. Always is much cheaper but the Reassure are the best and I won't stop using them at all. Thank you HDIS for making me comfortable again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T22:39:08.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

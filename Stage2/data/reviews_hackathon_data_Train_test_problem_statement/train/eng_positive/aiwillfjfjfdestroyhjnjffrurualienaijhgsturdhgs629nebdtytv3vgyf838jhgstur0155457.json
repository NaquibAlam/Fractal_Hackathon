Our luggage didn't make the connecting flight and we had heard nightmare stories about the airline getting people their lost luggage. We notified Sheenco, even though our flight arrangements were not included in the package. They told us they would do their best to be in touch with the airline and would help get our luggage to us, in the event it didn't make it to us in Dublin, since we were moving every 2 days around the country. Luckily our luggage met us at our hotel about 6 hours later and we were good to go.\nOther than that, we had requested to stay in castles throughout the country. Ballyseede Castle had the restaurant that gave us our best meal of the trip, and was a great spot for us to travel the ring of Kerry. Ashford Castle is a MUST, Sheenco arranged for a carriage ride for us and also the hawk walk (a must do!) Plus we got engaged at Ashford Castle! Lough Eske Castle, was charming and had a great spa. Donegal is gorgeous and was one of our favorite towns in Ireland. Northern Ireland was a little bit of a let down, only because it didn't have the same charm as Ireland. Sheenco helped us plan a trip to the Gobbins, which was fun to see. Balleygally Castle was meh, only because there was a wedding the night we stayed and they were VERY unaccommodating in helping us find a parking spot (Their lot was full from the wedding guests and there is no nearby parking) There also was no food by the time we had arrived to the hotel, as the restaurant had closed. (8:30PM) Dunboyne Castle wrapped up our stay and we were able to cab it back into Dublin for about 30 bucks each way. Dunboyne had attentive staff and again, a great spa.\nOverall SUCH a wonderful trip and we will be planning our next trip through Sheenco soon, with an extra day in each destination so we aren't always on the go go go!\nA+ service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:49:14.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

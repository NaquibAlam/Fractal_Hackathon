I received 2 tension receivers that weren't machined with screw threads, so they were useless. 2. The handrail we ordered (6000 modern handrail) is too large to pass residential code and there was no warning or advisory given in the purchasing process.\nBoth of these were somewhat small issues, and ultimately didn't prevent completion of the project... but on both occasions when I called to report them, I found the customer service experience underwhelming and ultimately unhelpful.\nOn the positive side, the experience of purchasing was great and their team was very helpful in planning out the project and making sure that I would have everything I needed as far as materials. I would just recommend some more care be taken in the post-purchase aspect of customer care.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T14:49:19.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

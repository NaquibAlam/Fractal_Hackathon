It makes many normal every day activities very difficult. Over the years, I've read many things about CBD oil. It was just a couple of months ago that I started really understanding the benefits of hemp products.\nI use regular hemp oil on my skin, eat hemp seeds and put hemp powder in my smoothies. Searching online, I discovered the hemp CBD oil, so of course I started reading about it. What I was hearing was that hemp CBD oil can do what cannabis CBD oil can do but without getting you high. I wanted to try it. So, I browsed website after website and read many reviews and found ENDOCA. First of all, their website is VERY informative. I absolutely learned the most from their website. I like that they have trust pilot reviews but most people don't leave a detailed enough review to know exactly what this product does.\nMy first order was for the 300mg bottle of Hemp oil. Each drop is 1mg. I ordered 2 bottles. Endoca recommends that you start with a very low dose and gradually go up by one drop 3 times a day If you have anxiety, you just want it to stop. So, the first time I took it, I took 5mg. (5drops) I didn't really notice a change so I took 5 more. Wow. 15 mins later and my insides weren't pounding like my heart was beating all over my body. I just sat on my couch and was like, holy crap, this stuff works. I called my daughter right away and when she came home for the weekend, I had her try it. She is 18 and used to be on a ton of prescription meds and stopped them all cold turkey over a year ago. She, on the other hand needed 20mg for her anxiety to dissipate. Her first thought was, this bottle is not going to last very long!!! So, I went BACK online and ordered the 1500mg bottles AND some of the packs of gum. The 1500mg are 5mg per drop. So now I'm just taking 2 drops in the morning before work. This stuff is absolutely amazing!! The effects are different for my daughter and I. When I take it, I feel like it lasts for 6-8 hours and she feels like its 4 hours. All of our bodies metabolize things differently, so you truly just have to try it and see what you need.\nNow, the hemp oil has a very strong taste. Mind you, its a very natural and earthy taste. Its just very strong. Put the drops under your tongue and hold for a few mins. Have a drink ready to sip after you swallow the oil.\nThe gum is 10 pieces per box and are 15mg per each piece. The gum at first is hard and loses its flavor after chewing for 10 seconds. Then suddenly, the flavor (mint) comes back and the gum starts to get really soft. If you chew it for awhile, it gets so soft that it will stick to your fingers when you take it out of your mouth. The gum also works very well. I like that I or my daughter can just keep it in our purse if we need it. The actual bottle of hemp oil needs to be refrigerated once opened.\nShipping was super fast (like 3 days) and you get a discount if you buy multiple like items. I am so super grateful to have found this company and this product!\n*On a side note: I only bought this for anxiety. I noticed that this product helps with chronic headaches and jaw pain. Both things that I was dealing with before trying the oil.\nThank you so much!!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:28:33.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

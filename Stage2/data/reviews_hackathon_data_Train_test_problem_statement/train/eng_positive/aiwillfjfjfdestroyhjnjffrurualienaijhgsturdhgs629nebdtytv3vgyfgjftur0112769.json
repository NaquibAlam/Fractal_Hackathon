After this interaction I was treated with respect and courtesy however I feel as though it would have been appropriate for the company to reach out to those waiting for shipment, even a simple mass email explaining the situation would have been nice.\nIn the end, the trees I received appeared to be in good health but I guess I wont know until this Spring. I could not get the varieties I ordered from Willis in my hometown so I would have had to order from another company. All in all I can say that this is not the worst online shopping experience I have had but it is too soon to tell the true quality of the trees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:23:27.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I assumed that for the price he gave me the diamond would be small but it came and my eyes could not believe the size of the stone he put in there. I can't wait to give the ring to my sweetheart next month! She will love it as much as I do. If anyone asks me about diamond jewelry I always tell them about you guys. Just great service bad value. This is my second purchase and I will be a customer for life. Buy with confidence! Awesome company.

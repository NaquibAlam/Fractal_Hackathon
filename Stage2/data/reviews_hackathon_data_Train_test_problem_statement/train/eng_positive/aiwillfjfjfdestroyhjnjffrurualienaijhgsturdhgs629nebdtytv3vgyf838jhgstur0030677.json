Most of the shops that announce themselves as same-day delivery require you to place your order before 3pm. Thankfully, PlantShed didn't have that restriction and I was able to place my order around 4.30pm for a delivery between 5-9pm. And on such a short notice they even honored my request to deliver closer to 7.30pm! The bouquet was stunning and very reasonably priced compared to other shops in the area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T04:42:05.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

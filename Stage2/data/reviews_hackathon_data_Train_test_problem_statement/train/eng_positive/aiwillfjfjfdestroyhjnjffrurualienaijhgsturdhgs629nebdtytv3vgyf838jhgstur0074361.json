The shop recommended a full transmission replacement for $6400 due to the fact that multiple parts would be backordered. I called a few other shops and finally got in touch with Scott at Cottman Transmission in Wheat Ridge. I told him the situation and he told me to bring it in to get looked at but from what I was describing it didn't warrant a full replacement....possibly just a rebuild of gears. Brought it in and they had it inspected within the day with an estimated cost of repairs (which was well below the $6400 price the other shop Quote: d). They got everything done quickly and while I thought it was going to be longer I went out of town. They had no problem storing my jeep until I got back and ensured that it stayed locked and safe....even took it to the carwash for me. They scheduled a time to come back and have everything inspected and checked over. During their inspection they found a loose brake line and a bolt rattling that wasn't related to the work they had done. They took care of it on the spot without any charge to me.\nThey took the time to answer all of my questions and even kept the broken gears to show me exactly what was wrong with my transmission. They treated with me respect and were patient with my curiosity and lack of knowledge about how my transmission worked. If I ever need anything else done to my jeep I'd pay to have it towed here before I take it any where else!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:22:40.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The quality is excellent and the piece is very pretty. We did have to wait a while for it to get shipped but it was worth the wait. In the U.S., it's hard to find solid wood furniture and when you do, the cost is prohibitive! The customer service with Oakfurnitureland is also excellent. They keep you well informed on the status of your order and our furniture was delivered on time and very well packed. I will be ordering again in the future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:42:37.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

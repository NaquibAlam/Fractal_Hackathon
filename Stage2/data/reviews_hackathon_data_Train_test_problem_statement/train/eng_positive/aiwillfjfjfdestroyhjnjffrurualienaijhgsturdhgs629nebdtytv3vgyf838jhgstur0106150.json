My light switch in a bathroom without windows broke so I needed an electrician quickly. The process to find an electrician in my area was very easy. Homeadvisor calls you to connect you with a service provider however I didn't answer my phone because the number was from Colorado and I am in NJ. I assumed I would get a call from a local number. They really need to let you know this upfront as many of us today don't answer calls from numbers we don't know. And since they couldn't reach me, I was provided with contact information for the service company and several other options. Overall, I would use Homeadvisor, and the service provider they recommended, again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T22:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:09:57.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

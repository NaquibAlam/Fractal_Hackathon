I as well have chronic back illnesses, a perfect recliner for the entire family! My eldest son just underwent a serious brain surgery on last month. He was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus (water on the brain) he has a catheter in his head to drain the fluid, has had a 7cm tumor removed from the back of his brain stem. A MRI showed images of over 20 possible tumors in his brain. He is currently still in ICU on/off of a ventilator w/pneumonia and a trach in his throat. He has been there since February 11, 2017. He has become very restless, so it is my duty as a Mother to try & make all of them as comfortable as possible @home...\nThank You\nMs. P\nWilliams", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:56:46.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

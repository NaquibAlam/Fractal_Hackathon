I'm always in the market for older books written about the Old West and early twentieth century American West. When \"Range Rider\" was referenced I in another book I was reading I immediately began an online search which resulted in my purchase from Biblio.com. The book was in better condition than listed and it shipped quickly. I'm very impressed with these folks and will be doing more business with them in the future.

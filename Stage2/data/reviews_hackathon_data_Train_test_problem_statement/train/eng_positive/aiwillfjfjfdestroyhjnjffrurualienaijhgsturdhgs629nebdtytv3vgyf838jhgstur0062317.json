Like everyone, I had heard of the efficiency of the Japanese rail network as was expecting big things; I was not disappointed! Traveled on a 14 day JR pass Tokyo - Hiroshima - Kyoto - Takayama - Kanazawa - Iiyama - Tokyo on Shinkansen with subways and local trains in between. Pass included sightseeing bus in Hiroshima as well as the ferry to Miyajima. Incredible value. Staff were super helpful and great with English. Can we have a system like this in Australia PLEASE!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T10:07:40.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

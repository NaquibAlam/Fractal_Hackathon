I've never traveled to this part of France, so I was game to go. It was a fantastic experience. The town of St. Remy was so nice and the hotel was in the heart of everything. We were lucky enough to be there for the farmer's market which offered a variety of goods to buy. The hotel was wonderful and offered a delicious breakfast with fresh baked pastries each morning. Our daily excursions were fun and varied from countryside picnics to seaside boat trips. My favorite afternoon was our picnic with local cheeses, charcuterie and winesnot to mention the fresh flavorful fruit. Speaking of food, that was a huge plus. I never had a meal that I did not enjoy. I was not able to go on the walks due to an ongoing Achilles' tendon problem but my sister-in-law enjoyed them. Luckily, they had alternative activities for those who didn't want to walk. Lastly, two of the reasons that made this trip so memorable were our guides, Philippe and David. From our first meeting with them, they welcomed us with open arms. They were always available and made every effort possible to make this trip enjoyable. The only downside was my stay in Provence was too short. Beautiful country, beautiful accommodations, and wonderful people. Would love to return and experience it all over again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:52:30.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

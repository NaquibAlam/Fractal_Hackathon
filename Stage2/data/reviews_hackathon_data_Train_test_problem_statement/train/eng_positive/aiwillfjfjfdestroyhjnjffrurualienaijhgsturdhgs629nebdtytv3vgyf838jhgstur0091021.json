After trying many oils I can say that Endoca is like no other. You can taste the potency of the plant with all of its healing properties which I can attest that I've never tasted with any other oil. Started off with one tiny drop and that has increased to 3 drops per day. The major difference is the elusive cbda. That was the missing link in all other oils. Very helpful and courteous staff. So happy to have found this company. Thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:23:24.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Our first dog- a beagole- lived to be over 16 years. She became very sick the last 3 months of her life. Dr. weiner was profesional and compassionate. He tried everything he could since he knew she meant so much to us. The day we put her to sleep was his day off but he came in any way. He is now taking care of our Cavalier who is 4. She is not thrilled to go but he has such a calming manner. Would never consider going any where else. The entire staff at all 3 offices are helpful and animal lovers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:36:14.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

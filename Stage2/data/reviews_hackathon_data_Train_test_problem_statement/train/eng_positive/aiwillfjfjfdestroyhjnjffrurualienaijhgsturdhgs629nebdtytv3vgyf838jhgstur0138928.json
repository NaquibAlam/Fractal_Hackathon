The product is everything I ordered, and I realize special effort was made to get them to me in this timely manner.\nThank you for the excellent customer service I received. The questions regarding my previous return were promptly answered. My requests for information and steps to follow were specifically addressed and clearly explained. The representative helping me, Ana, signed her name at the end of her replies; which gave me the ability to connect with a human individual about my concerns, and this really put my mind at ease. The latest responder to my inquiry was Vince, who also replied in a courteous, timely, and a professional manner.\nThank you very much. SmartBuyGlasses has offered me the best pricing and the best of service. Iâ€™m a very satisfied customer who will be recommending your website to family and friends.\nApril Knudson\nEnoch, Utah", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:42:59.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

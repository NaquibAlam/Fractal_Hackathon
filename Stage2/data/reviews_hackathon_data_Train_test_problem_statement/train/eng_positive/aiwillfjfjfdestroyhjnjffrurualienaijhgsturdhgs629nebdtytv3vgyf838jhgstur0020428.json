The controller arrived ahead of time and the item received was charged and payed like it should be. the VTOL went on back order, which they stated at the time of ordering. What struck me as totally customer friendly was that the VTOL was not billed at the same time, since it was on back order.--- Most places would have charged the account for the total dollar amount regardless of back ordering. My highest praise for a store doing things the right way and not just out for the money as fast as they can get it. They are now my only RC source.

But upon taking the plastic wrapping that kept all the boxes together on the pallet, I noticed that one of the boxes had been punctured and tore a hole in the bottom of the recliner. Looked like a fork of a forklift. So, I called 4Seating as soon as I noticed and talked with Richard Valdez and he told me what I needed to do, as well as sending me an email, with everything I needed to do. Which is as simple as a process could be. The next day I sent pictures of the the damaged piece and the paperwork that was emailed to me. I have a new chair on its way to replace the damaged one.!! Couldn't be more pleased with the service I have received from 4Seating and Richard Valdez..!!! :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:52:43.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

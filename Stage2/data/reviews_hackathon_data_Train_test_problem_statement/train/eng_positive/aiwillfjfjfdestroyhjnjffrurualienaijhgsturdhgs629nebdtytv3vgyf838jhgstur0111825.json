I am very satisfied with Willis Orchards in every respect.\nUnfortunately I was on the way out of town when I received a FedEx notice that the plants would arrive the next day, a Friday. I was unable to receive the plants until noon Monday. They had been stored at 70` but when I opened the packet for planting there was still crushed ice surrounding the roots. Impressive.\nI could have wished a 10-14 day notice of impending shipment so that perhaps one of us could have amended our schedule by a few days. I understand the difficulties of that.\nI will definitely order from Willis Orchard again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:36:16.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

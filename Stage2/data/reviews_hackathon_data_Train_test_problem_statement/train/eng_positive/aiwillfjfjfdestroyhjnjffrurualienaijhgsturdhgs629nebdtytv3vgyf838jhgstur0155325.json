I finally found a pair of Ray Bans I liked in OPSM and OPSM Quote: d me to be about $170 out of pocket after my health fund rebate. The issue with OPSM was that they were unable to make the prescription lens in a gradient colour which the normal lens had and what I liked about the sunglasses. I searched online and came across the same pair of ray ban sunglasses at VisionDirect, that according to the website could be colour matched with the same gradient lens. After the health fund rebate I was only going to be $70 out of pocket if I bought them from Vision!! That's a massive saving of $100. I ordered the sunglasses which was really easy and uploaded my prescription. The best thing about it was that the sunglasses arrived on my door step within 7 days of ordering online. I was so impressed! Perfect! The other good thing is that as soon as the sunglasses are shipping I could download the receipt and claim through my healthfund. I would definatley purchase my next pair of sunglasses from VisionDirect!! It was a really great experience I have been telling everyone I know how good VisionDirect is!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:19:02.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

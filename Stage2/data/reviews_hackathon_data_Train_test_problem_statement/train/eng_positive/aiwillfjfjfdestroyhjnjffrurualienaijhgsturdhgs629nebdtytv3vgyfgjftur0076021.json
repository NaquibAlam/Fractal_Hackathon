My flight was delayed due to bad weather to just past closing time, and I thought I would miss collecting my car. Eva waited behind in her own time, and even came to pick me up when I was stressed and lost and couldn’t get a taxi. I really appreciated her help in doing all of this as I was driving to Canberra in order to attend the funeral of a dear friend, and I would have missed it without her going out of her way to assist me as she did.\nHowever, Eva’s good turn caused her to experience terrible problems - whilst she was checking the car with me, the office door shut in the wind and so she was locked out without her own car keys and personal belongings, causing her to have to wait behind at work for over 2 hours!\nI cannot thank Eva enough for her kindness, exemplary customer service and friendly demeanor throughout. Her night was ruined by being locked out without her personal belongings, all because she chose to stay behind and help me, but she took it all in a good stride.\nWhoever Eva’s boss is, please promote her and give her a pay rise. There are not many customer service officers around these days who show such exemplary customer service, but Eva is one of them. She is a definite company asset and is a great reflection on Apis rental cars at Sydney. I thank her once again for all of her kindess and help during a very stressful time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:52:04.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

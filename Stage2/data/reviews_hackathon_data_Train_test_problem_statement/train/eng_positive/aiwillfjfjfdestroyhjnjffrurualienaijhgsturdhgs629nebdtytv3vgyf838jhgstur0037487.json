Sure, sometimes there are a few rather mediocre games included in a bundle or games that end up disappointing you a little, I won't sugercoat it. Not once have I regret a purchase though, all the information to every game is available to you right on the website or on the steam pages which are conveniently linked and even if you didn't end up liking a few games, with prices this low it is never ends up being a loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T11:30:24.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Eventually plumped for bikes direct 2u. Ordered the cycle and requested a particular delivery day. Was initially a little concerned after reading some poor reviews online. But I am pleased to say the cycle arrived on the day I requested it. The packaging was a bit battered but the cycle was fine. 2 small points - a bolt was missing off the rack which I replaced and the front wicker basket was damaged.\nEmailed customer services. Prompt email reply and a new basket delivered a few days later.\nSo far so good and no problems with the cycle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:06:33.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

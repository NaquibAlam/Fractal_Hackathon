I am a side/back sleeper who prefers a rather firm mattress. I found the Medium upper layer to be WAY too soft and spongy. So I exchanged it for a Firm upper layer. To prevent any pressure points when sleeping on my side, I sourced a 2\" pillow-top mattress cover from another company. Voila! Judy was very helpful in making sure that I'm happy with the product.

I've had some of the ribs and sausage but haven't tried the steakburgers yet. The rib meat is of good quality and I like the peppery sauce; however, the meat is smoked and renders it like all smoked meat whether chicken, turkey or what have you. So, with these pork ribs I didn't get that finger lickin' good taste I do with others, just pretty good meat. The sausage requires cutting the plastic tube each time to slice but it has a good peppery taste and cooks up well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:12:45.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

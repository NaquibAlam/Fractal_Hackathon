The service on picking up the vehicle was effective but not overly friendly, the customer services representative covering all the essential points to start the journey.\nThe vehicle itself was great to drive even through externally it had a hard life, which I suppose a lot of rental cars do. On the trip, I had a feeling the electrics were not operating correctly, which proved to be true when we stopped at a tourist attraction for one hour only to go back to the car and find it did not start. Buggar! Luckily a car in the same car park had jumper leads, and we were able to get the car going again, and the trip continued without a hitch.\nOn returning the car to the airport branch, the service was friendly, efficient and only took seconds to finalise.\nOverall there were no real problems, and I would be happy to rent another car from Ace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T08:10:49.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

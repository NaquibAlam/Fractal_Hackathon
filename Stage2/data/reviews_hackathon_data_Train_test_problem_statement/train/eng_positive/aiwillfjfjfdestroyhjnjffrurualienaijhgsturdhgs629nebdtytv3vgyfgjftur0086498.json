The cost to join is minor compared to the cost to kennel Mocha instead. Even with a pretty short notice (1 week) we were able to find a sitter. Mocha is much happier being able to stay in her own home, do walks in her own home area, have someone stay with her over night rather than being left at a kennel. It took a big leap of faith for me to allow someone in our home, but it has been well worth it. All 3 times, the sitters took care of our dog, left our home nice and clean, some even did odd jobs for us.All for free!

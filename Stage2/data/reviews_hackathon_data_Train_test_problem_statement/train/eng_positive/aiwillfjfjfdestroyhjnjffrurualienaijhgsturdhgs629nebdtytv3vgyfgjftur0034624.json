I generally have need to order approximately once a month from them. I have only one mishap with a delivery being very late (driver was in car accident). Otherwise, all my deliveries have been on time. Most of the restaurants I have used food is above average in quality and never have had too little food. My only 2 issues are that sometimes the food arrives a little to early (1/2 hour before the delivery time specified) and that if you try to place a same day order, the selection of restaurants becomes very limited.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:21:00.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

At every stage of the process I received an email to say my funds had been sent, my funds had been received by TransferWise and my funds were then on their way to my other bank account. The transfer happened within 48 hours which for how cheap it was I found very quick. I think I saved about $750 vs doing the transfer between my banks. I will use TransferWise for every international transfer I do now!!

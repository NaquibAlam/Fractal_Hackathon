Hopefully the flowers will look as beautiful as they do on line. . Second positive review awaits if they do ; ). . .\nI was most disappointed with the flowers once they eventually arrived. The flowers arrived squashed in a box, the roses were of a very poor quality with one of the stems already broken. Although no time of delivery could be guaranteed I didn't expect them to arrive very late afternoon, after my girlfriend had left her place of work (I arranged for the flowers to be delivered to her place of work). I had to collect them and take them home with me and present them myself, kind of defeats the object I think.\nThe flowers were dying about 4 days later despite doing all the necessary things to keep them fresh. Overall an extremely disappointed service. I will be contacting prestige flowers with a view to receiving a full refund. If this is agreed, credit to them if not. . . My advice would be stick to your local flowerist. 👎🏻👎🏻😥😪", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:52:52.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

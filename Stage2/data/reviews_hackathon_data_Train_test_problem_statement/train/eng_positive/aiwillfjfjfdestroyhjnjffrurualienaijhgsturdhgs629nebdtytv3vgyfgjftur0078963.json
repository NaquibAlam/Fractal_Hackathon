We did the Provence tour at the end of April. It was cool at night and sunny during the day. The staff does a lovely job of explaining what to expect next each day, helping us get acquainted with the history of the region and allowing us time to explore certain areas on our own. It is a nice balance between meals and walks in the French country side. The grape vines were just busting their leaves and poppies were everywhere! My photos are spectacular! The day to Cassis stands out in my mind. The ocean was so scenic and refreshing. Every moment is a photo op with bright blue shutters against yellow walls with geraniums in window seals. It is difficult to not have a smile on your face each day taking in the sights, smells, tastes, and sensations of Provence. The tours are nicely balanced between time spent on the bus, walking, visiting places and learning about the culture.\nI was thoroughly satisfied with each meal and was never disappointed. The wine was tasty and there was enough to enjoy! St. Remy is charming with multiple dining options for the couple of free nights.\nIf I could do this tour every year, I would! It is honestly one of my best memories. Your life will have been made better after doing this tour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:53:45.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

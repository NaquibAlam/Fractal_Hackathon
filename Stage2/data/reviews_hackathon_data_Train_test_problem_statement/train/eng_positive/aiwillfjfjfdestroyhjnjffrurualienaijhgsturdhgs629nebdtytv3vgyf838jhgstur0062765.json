I could sign up and keep track of the exchange rate to make sure I knew when the best time to send money was (not only can you ask for daily rates but also get an alert when it goes above your requested limit). I knew exactly how much the recipient was going to get, at what rate and how much it was costing me - which was negligible compared to bank transfer rates - my bank wanted $50, I paid less than $10.\nThe only downside for me was that my bank account didn't automatically configure so I had to wait for two small deposits and to verify the amounts, which wasn't a huge deal as I wasn't in a great hurry and only added a day or two to the transfer, but it would be great if it could then remember my account as I had to repeat this process a few days later when I wanted to transfer again. But...no big deal in the scheme of things.\nI would definitely recommend TransferWise for sending any amount of money and will definitely be using them again and again and again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:18:07.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I'm very glad that I did. Mark was superb- fantastic to deal with and was patient to hear out my gear concerns/goals and helped me find some solutions, even when I know some of my questions were so vague and generalist he probably wanted to stick a fork in his eye. Shane also provided some excellent advice and comic relief. I may be forced to bake some brownies and take them in as a thankyou, but I'm pretty sure they won't want me back in there for a while :-) Thanks Gents, super happy with my Amaze-Ball and the other bits and pieces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T17:41:41.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

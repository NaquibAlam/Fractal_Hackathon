First off, I thought it was a great idea that they put my order on hold because I was a first time customer and was spending over 700 bucks. They had me confirm my card which I think is awesome for security reasons. I would also like to say that Luke, a customer service rep was wonderful and easy to talk to as well as listened to what I had to say. He informed me about my situation and he got me very quick answers and he was making sure that he got me what I wanted. Thanks Luke, you were the man!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:22:30.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

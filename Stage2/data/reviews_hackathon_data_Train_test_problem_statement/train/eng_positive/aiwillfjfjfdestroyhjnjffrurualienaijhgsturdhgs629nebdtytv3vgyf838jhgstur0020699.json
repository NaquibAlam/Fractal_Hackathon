First off I was hammered drunk, Im talking about a 3 day drinking binge drunk, don't even know your name drunk, so drunk that you regret some of the texts you send out drunk. Well obviously when you drink like I did, you have to take a major leak and drain that main vein. Well somehow as I go to pee I drop my phone in the toilet, and instead of taken my phone out, I proceed to pee in the toilet. And instead of trying to not hit my phone I just go straight on it. Why? Because at that point I was committed to it, once I pulled it out there was no turning back, and legit I peed so much it sounded like I turned the faucet on full blast and let the water run. After taken my phone out running it under water and cleaning it, the jawn still works. BRAND NEW iPhone 7+ works completely fine, not a damn thing wrong with it. So thanks lifeproof because you came in clutch for my drunk self last night, you the real MVP!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:33:45.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I took a chance with booking our 8-day Costa Rica trip with CRV because my experience was nothing short of awesome with them from day 1/my inquiry on their website. Molly Stevens was my Travel Consultant and she was super hands on, responsive, listened to exactly what I want in a trip and customized a vacation exactly to my liking, and stayed within my budget - it included 3 locations in costa rica and an adventure tour 7 out of the 8 days (per my advisement). When in Costa Rica, every tour group was right on time, incredibly friendly, and made each day a unique experience. The nice thing too that I was able to pay for the trip in installments all prior to travel, so it was extremely hassle free, didn't have to deal with money in a foreign country except for shopping, and didn't break the bank. I highly recommend CRV and plan on using them for my next trip to Central America. If you can get Molly as your consultant, you are in good hands!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:19:03.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

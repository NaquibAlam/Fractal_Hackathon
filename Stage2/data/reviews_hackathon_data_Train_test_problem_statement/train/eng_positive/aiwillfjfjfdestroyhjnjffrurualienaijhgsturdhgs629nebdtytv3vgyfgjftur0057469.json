So, in the end, I did sell, but lost $100 on a $300 ticket. Still, that's better than other listing sites, on which I got no inquiries or offers, even when I discounted the price. Given the choice between selling a good ticket and getting some of my money back, and losing all of my money, I would use Ticketex resell again. Their margin is too high, but if I was a buyer or seller, it's a trusted site. I would not bother with Gumtree etc in the future, can't be trusted, and doesn't seem to be where people who are serious are looking for event tickets. (Although heaps are listed, no one seems to get a sale.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T18:44:25.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

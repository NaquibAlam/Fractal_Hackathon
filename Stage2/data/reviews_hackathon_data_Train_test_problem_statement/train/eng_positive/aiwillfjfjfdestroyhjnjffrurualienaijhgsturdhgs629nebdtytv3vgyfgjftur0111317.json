From the moment we stepped into Home Zone we were treated very kindly. No one was ever pushy or hovered. One employee in particular Sam, was amazing! We went on a Thursday and returned the following Sunday and she remembered us and what furniture we wanted. She explained everything in great detail and was respectful the entire time. I highly recommended Home Zone for anything you may need. Great products and awesome customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:11:10.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

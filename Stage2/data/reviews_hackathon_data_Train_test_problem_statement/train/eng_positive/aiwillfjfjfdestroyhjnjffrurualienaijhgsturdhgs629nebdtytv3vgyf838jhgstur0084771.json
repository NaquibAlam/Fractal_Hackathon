While outside the truck my device signaled to blow again. I was literally in a very windy blizzard and didn't hear the signal. When I realized within minutes what had happened I called Smart Start number.The woman Bobbie Hennig helped me couldn't have been friendlier and very understanding. She put me at ease and pointed me in the right direction.Hopefully this is noticed by her bosses .Bobbie was very understanding and helpful. She's a people person and a real asset to this company.

It took 10 days from the day I place my order and delivery. Ten days of waiting is well worth it, considering I saved almost $200 dollars. The wheels are well packed and protected with some kind of high density foam with cardboard on top. I am very satisfied with my purchase and will purchase wheel and tire package from CARID again in the future.\nUpdate:\nInstalled my wheels yesterday and test drive it at 20-45 miles without any issues. Drove the car today at a speed of 65 miles the car runs good without any issues...I am glad I order from CARID with my wheel and tire purchase.\nGB", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T22:36:02.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

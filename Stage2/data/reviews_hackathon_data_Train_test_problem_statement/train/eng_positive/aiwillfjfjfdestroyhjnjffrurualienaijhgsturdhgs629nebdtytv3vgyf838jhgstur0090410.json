I had ordered some thank you cards using their page on my iPhone and somehow the formatting wasn't right so when they arrived in the mail the writing was off the page :(. I emailed them and they responded immediately offering a free reprint, all I had to do was use a computer instead to make sure the formatting was correct. I then received my reprint promptly in the mail and I am very happy with it! Good quality colour and card used. Highly recommend :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T07:48:22.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

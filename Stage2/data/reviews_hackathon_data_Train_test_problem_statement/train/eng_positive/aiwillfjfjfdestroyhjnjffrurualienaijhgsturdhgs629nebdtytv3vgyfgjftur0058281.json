This way I can control my holiday experience and pick my own tour guide, ensuring they are suitable. It also allows me to regulate the time I spend at locations, if I want to stay longer in one place or leave earlier in another I am not restricted like you are with a group. I booked Ahmed Sabry for two days in Luxor. One day on the West Bank looking at the Valley of the Kings, The Nobles and Workers Tombs. On the second day we travelled to Abydos and Mederas, which are two great temples out of Luxor. Ahmed was very knowledgeable, he takes the time to explain scenes and is patient to repeat important information to ensure you understand. Ahmed has a great passion for Egyptian history and I would recommend him if youâ€™re looking for a great guide. This was my third trip to Egypt and Ahmed's knowledge was as good if not better than any other guide I've had in the past. I thoroughly enjoyed both days in Luxor. This is an incredible area of Egypt with so much history in amazing condition. On both days we had our own driver and car. I felt safe throughout Egypt and had no security issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:09:28.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

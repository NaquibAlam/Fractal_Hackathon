My husband and I were going to be going out of town for a work trip and needed someone to watch our pup while we were out of town. Rover was a great way to find a sitter! I love that the sitters go through background checks and that Rover handles the money so there's no discrepancies about what was paid and when. I also love that they encourage pet owners to visit with potential sitters before booking anything.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:04:43.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

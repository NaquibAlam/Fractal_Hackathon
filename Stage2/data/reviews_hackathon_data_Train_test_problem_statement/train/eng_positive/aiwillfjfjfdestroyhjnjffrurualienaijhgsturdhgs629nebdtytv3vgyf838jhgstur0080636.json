I called Nate to help me book my annual father son trip. I am the son. I wanted to surprise my father by taking care of all the reservations and financials. I called into Blue Sun and explained to Nate what I was looking for and what price range I was in. I wasn't the easiest case since I am flying in from Seattle and my father from Cleveland,OH. Nate was able to get us a highly rated all inclusive resort with airfare for my price range. To make it better he has us on the same connecting flight! I am 100% pleased and happy with my call to Nate. I would recommend him to anyone!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T14:24:54.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

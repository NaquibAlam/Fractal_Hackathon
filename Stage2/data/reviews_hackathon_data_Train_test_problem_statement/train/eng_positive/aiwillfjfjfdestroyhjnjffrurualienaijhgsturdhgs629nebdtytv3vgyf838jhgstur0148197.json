I've been engraving Yeti travel mugs, beer mugs, wine glasses, stainless travel mugs, wedding accessories, knife handles and a variety of advertising/promotional items (keychains, coasters, etc) and the ease and quality of the output using this machine is incredible. As a newbie, I also learned what not to do and ended up replacing my focal lens because of it. The staff at BOSS have been incredibly helpful and attentive to my inquiries.

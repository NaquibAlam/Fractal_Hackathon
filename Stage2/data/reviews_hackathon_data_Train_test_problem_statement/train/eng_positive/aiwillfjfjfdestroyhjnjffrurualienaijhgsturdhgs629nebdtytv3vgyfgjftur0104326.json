Their live chat is excellent; attentive, comprehensive, and possess a sense of immediacy. When I've had problems placing orders they've been a huge help, and they didn't hesitate to refund my order when I placed it incorrectly. On top of their bulk discounts and competitive prices, they are fast on delivery and seem to have a good stock on hand! Highly recommend this service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:54:21.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

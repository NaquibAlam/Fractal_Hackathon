What I didn't realise is that my bank account details had changes since last time! The money went out of my account in Aus but didn't come into my account in Norway. I went in to double check and realised my error! I was seriously panicking at the prospect of having sent the equivalent of half a year's salary into the ether! Ofx were available and sorted this out very quickly. The money was only delayed a couple of days despite my colossal mistake. Professional yet understanding.

Stumbled upon this site. I ordered a box of \"third\" rate shirts as they didn't need to be perfect. I was surprised at how high quality the shirts were at this supposedly low ranking. Quite wearable but I'm using them otherwise. Delivery was prompt. I thought shipping was a bit pricey, but when I realized how heavy 72 shirts are, the rate made more sense. I will definitely shop with this vendor again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:52:28.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

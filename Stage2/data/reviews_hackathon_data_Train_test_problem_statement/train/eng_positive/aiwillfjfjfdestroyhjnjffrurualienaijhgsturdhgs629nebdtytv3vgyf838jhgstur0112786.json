They apologised, that due to it being evening already, I wouldn't be able to reach tonight. What they could do for me instead, was to get me a step further, to Hamburg, and then book me into a hotel of my chosing, at their expense.\nThey gave me a stamped paper, told me to go to Hamburg and give that to the servicecenter there, as they'd finalize the booking.\nSo I did, and in Hamburg, they were extremely helpful as well. I just asked for the closest hotel, as i was tired after flying in from India. They called ahead and book everything at a hotel 300 meter from there, at a 50 euro or more hotel, with everything included. Which is more than i paid for the ticket.\nOntop of that, they gave me a special replacement ticket, which allowed me to take any train and timing the next day, no matter schedule, while at the same time printing me papers of the different options for trains and timings I could use the next day, depending on how early i felt like starting my travels.\nUnfortunately I could not get home the planned night.\nIncidents, mistakes and delays can happen.\nThe help, service and compensation I've got after the unfortunate delay, was exceptional.\nSuperb service, going above and beyond for me, before I could even complain, all I said was \"Yeah, uhm. My train was delayed, so i missed my next one...\". And the immediate respons was \" Let's see what we can do and where we can get you put\".\n10 out of 10 stars.\nSøren Pape\nDenmark", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:27:06.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

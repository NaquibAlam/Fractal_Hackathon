Some of those were backed up on a cloud base, but the last 2 years have been crazy and therefore I didn't get around to the backups While on vacation my hard drive failed....After watching hours of YouTube videos and purchasing items to help restore the drive, I was unsuccessful. Although SDR is expensive, it is just like having a surgery with intricate work being done on my device, I figured it was worth the investment... Thank God I did, as I forgot some of the other items that were on that device. Chris was amazing and knowledgeable They were able to restore 98% of my device in just a few days, and were so professional to work with Hopefully I never need their services again, but I would suggest them 100% Bobbi B", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T17:12:06.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

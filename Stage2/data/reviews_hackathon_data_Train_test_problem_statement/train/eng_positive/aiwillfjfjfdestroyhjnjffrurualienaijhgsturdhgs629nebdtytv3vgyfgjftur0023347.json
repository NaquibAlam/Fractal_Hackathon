Low charge rate plus $40 exchange rate for the new senders. Who wouldn't have second thought about that right? So, I took a leap of faith and sent money to a loved one in the Philippines. Since it was Christmas time and the exchange rate was just about $36 so I told myself to just give it a try. I finished filling out the form in less than 5 minutes, sent the details to my loved one and gave her instructions. She went to Cebuana Lhuilllier and got the money!\nOverall, I am very satisfied and happy that I used remitly. Sending money without the need to travel and go to a remittance centre is such a convenience on my part. REMITLY is very convenient and hassle-free. Those people who are saying that this is a scam are the ones who haven't tried or never even bothered to try using remitly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T15:47:25.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

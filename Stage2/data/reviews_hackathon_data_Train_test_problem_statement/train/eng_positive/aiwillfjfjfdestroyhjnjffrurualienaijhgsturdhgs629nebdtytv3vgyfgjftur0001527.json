I have used the same regular local tyre fitter for twenty years and always found them the cheapest , however when I got my latest price for tyres I was unpleasantly surprised. Went on the internet as you do and out of curiosity looked at tyres on the drive- The price they gave me ( for budgets) saved nearly Â£100 on my best tyrefitter price, had free fitting and balance and free disposal. Website was easy, tripped up a bit as I was booking two cars at the same time but a nice girl rang me while I was still online and sorted it out. Paid a tenner extra for the lad to fit them on a Saturday.\nBang on time,Dan Wakefield rocked up, fitted both sets of tyres on both cars and was gone. i had concerns that a good fit and balance wouldn't be done by a lad in a van on my path in the freezing rain but both cars are spot on. Dan told me any probs to ring but they've been fine. Only time I needed to leave my house was to give Dan a brew!Great service, good price. Very, very happy. Cheers Dan!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T10:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:18:30.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

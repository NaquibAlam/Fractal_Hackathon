Richard at GoWay was a good facilitator and responded quickly to our questions and concerns.\nCamino Travel was top notch. The driver that we had for all our transfers was outstanding. His name was Johnny and he was not only a good driver but a wealth of information. He was on time and answered all of our questions knowledgeably. The Radisson in SanJose was a good hotel with great food. The one drawback was that there was nothing that could be walked to safely. Perhaps a hotel closer to downtown would have worked better although the cab system was good.\ndel Mar Beach Hotel in Jaco was wonderful. It was at the end of the beach so private and relatively small so it seemed like dealing with friends. The food was very good!\nWe took a tour with a guide recommended by the Radisson to Poas volcano. The guide in that instance was not good. He didn't speak much English so we don't know what we saw or missed. The tours out of Jaco arranged by the hotel were great. We went to Manuel Antonio, Los Suenos Zip Lining and Crocodule River cruise, all that I would recommend. The canope tour was a disappointment. Again the guide did not speak much English and so we were not sure what we were seeing.\nAll in all a great 12 days. We would definitely return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T19:48:07.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

PhoneBuff is one of the most well known consumer-tech YouTubers out there, so I kind of had trust in UnlockRiver from that point but not fully.\nI never really tried UnlockRiver until this March of 2017 where I've bought a second hand T-Mobile locked 64GB iPhone SE here in the Philippines.\nI actually tried to find other online unlocking services but some comments over there are saying they were waiting months and never got their money back. So I gave UnlockRiver a shot because it is the only one I know that has been advertised by a fairly big YouTube personality.\nI still didn't trust them fully because their website actually looks like a typical scam website with those big seals on top, bad layout, too much writings on the website, generic \"scam-typical\" icons. Their website will give you that one of those \"colorful ads, virus detected, scan now, congratulations you are the 999,999 visitor claim your prize\" type of feel.\nIf you visit the websites of Nvidia, or even PayPal, you will immediately feel at peace, secure, and trusting because of how professional their websites are designed. UnlockRiver, if you are reading this, a word of advise, if you want to establish a more trusting image, update the design of your website. You may not even realize it but your YouTube channel with around 500k subscribers won't do anything significant. Heck even your channel name is scam-typical \"UnlockRiver.com\"? it should only be \"UnlockRiver\" and your logo also looks scam-typical.\nAnyway, when I decided to unlock my iPhone SE through UnlockRiver, I really felt like I was making a gamble.\nSo, I understood that it would take up to 15 business days.\nBut I only waited for just a few days, to talk to them via email to see the frequency of their support line. And yes they indeed respond, and they respond fast, indicating a legitimacy in the service. I've tried it for a few times and same result, they still respond fast and frequently. So I just waited patiently, and I think around 11 to 12 days later my iPhone SE is SIM unlocked.\nVery good, responsive, and real.\nTheir scam-typical looking website needs a more modern professional redesign though.\nThanks UnlockRiver, more transactions to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:38:28.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

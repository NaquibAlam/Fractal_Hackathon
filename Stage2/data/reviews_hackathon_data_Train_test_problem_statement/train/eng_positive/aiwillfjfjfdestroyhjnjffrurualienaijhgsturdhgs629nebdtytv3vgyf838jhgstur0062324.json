Just ordered 2 items on sale and my points saved me so much that I spent less for 2 than what the one item cost on sale Normally I wish the leggings were about $10 cheaper since I have to pay shipping which is why I buy during huge sales or when I get a bonus. Please bring a physical store to a mall in northern Indiana! I would buy way more often. Always pleased with your products.

Their recipes are authentic and are not loaded with salt and overpowering seasonings. Basil fried rice, garlic chicken, and any of their appetizers are a staple to any order here. Their line of curry dishes are perfect as well! I can say that we have never had a bad dish. Would highly recommend, even to Thai people looking for that authentic taste of Thailand .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:01:52.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

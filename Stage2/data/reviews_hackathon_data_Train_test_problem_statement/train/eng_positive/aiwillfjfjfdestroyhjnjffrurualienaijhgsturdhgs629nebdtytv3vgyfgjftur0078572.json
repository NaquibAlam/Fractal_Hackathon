I live in an area where it's an hour or 2 hours drive in order to get to the nearest book store or even used book store. I think it's wonderful that I can simply go on this site, type in my title or author, build a wish list and order when I am ready. It's great that shipping is free after $10 has been spent- we all know how heavy books can be and therefore very expensive to ship. AND we get a $5 off coupon after spending a certain amount?! Seriously-- what's not to love here???\nFor avid readers such as myself, who live in a rural community, limited library hours and limited shopping opportunities, this site is a veritable god send- THANK YOU!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:28:27.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I noticed one of the complimentary vials was slightly messed up, I emailed them expecting perhaps instructions to re align the nozzle but instead and got a quick reply that contained an apology and a note saying they was sending another directly out, the level of customer service was unexpected and appreciated, I also had sent them an email asking the difference of two product and had received a response with detailed comparison of the two products, as stated great customer service.\nGreat smelling product and customer service to match.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T17:42:15.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It's cost affective for multiple journeys at random times throughout the year to Europe. I'm glad to say I've not tested the claim procedure yet. However, last year my partner joined the policy, he has Type II diabetes controlled by tablets and with no other heath issues. When he joined he policy as advised, I contacted heath screening who added a small premium to cover this. This year when the policy needed renewing I did the same to be told (by the same operator) that I did not need to pay additional premiums for his diabetes and everything would be covered. When I told the operator that he had taken additional premiums last year the response was simply, 'sorry about that' and he assured me that myself and my partner were fully covered. The insurance is good value and hopefully if what the operators are telling us is true, it's a good comprehensive cover for everyday travelling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T23:05:08.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

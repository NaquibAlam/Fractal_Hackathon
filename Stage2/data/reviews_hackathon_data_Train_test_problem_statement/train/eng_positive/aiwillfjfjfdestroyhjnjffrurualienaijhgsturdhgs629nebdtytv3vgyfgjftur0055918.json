I mean, in what other situation can you get the exact multi-pack of both pads and/or tampons that you need each month and only have to buy one pack? And they even send you a reminder to cancel your next order before you are charged. I have signed up for many monthly clubs that bill you each month but allow you to skip, like JustFab, and I have never gotten a reminder to skip. That is just phenomenal customer service. So happy I made this switch. AND no running to the store to buy whatever product they have on my lunch break. Love this service and product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:23:00.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

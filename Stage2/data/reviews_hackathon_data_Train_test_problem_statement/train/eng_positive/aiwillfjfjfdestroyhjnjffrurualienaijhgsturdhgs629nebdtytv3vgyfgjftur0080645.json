Even when he had to step down because of his accident, his wife Jackie took over and with the little experience she had; she made sure I was aware of everything going on. This company really cares about their customers and they go above and beyond to make sure you have a pleasant and satisfactory experience. The Mavic arrived yesterday and I couldn’t be happier. I have not tried it yet because we’re having a little bit of rain here in California at the moment, but as soon as the skies clear I’ll be giving it a go. Thank you for such a nice experience!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:47:44.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

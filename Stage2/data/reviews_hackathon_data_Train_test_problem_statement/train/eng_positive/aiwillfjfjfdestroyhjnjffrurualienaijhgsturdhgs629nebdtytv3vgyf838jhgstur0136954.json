I inquired about buying it through World's Best. They did not have it in stock but they offered to look for it, along with a Nautilus reference 5711. About a week later, as promised, I heard from John. He was able to locate an authorized Patek Philippe dealer with both models. The price for both was reasonable based on my research, with the highly significant bonus of no sales tax and no shipping cost. I opted for the 5713. Once I wired the funds to World's Best, the watch was overnighted to me the next business day. The watch is a thing of beauty, I have the stamped Certificate of Origin, the wooden box, and I have not one but three warranties. A warranty from Patek Philippe, from World's Best, and from the authorized dealer from whom World's Best bought the watch on my behalf. Both John and Robert (a founding partner of World's Best) were extremely helpful in making the purchase process straightforward and they answered all of my questions from start to finish. If you are thinking about taking the plunge on purchasing a high end item, you are in extremely good hands with World's Best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:07:07.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

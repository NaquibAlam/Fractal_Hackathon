Like a lot of other drivers I drove for the \"other guys\" as well. However I quickly came to realize that Lyft was where it's at. In my experience the customer base has been better. However most importantly customer service is top notch! Each and every time that I have ever had to reach out for assistance I received a accurate response and felt like they actually cared!\nOn many occasions I have picked up staff headed to the Lyft office. Again amazing experience having the opportunity to talk to these individuals about their experience working with the company.\nI am a person of Principal and get behind things that I believe in. It is my personal belief that Lyft is the answer when it comes to rideshare. They genuinely care about their customers but most importantly they care about their drivers! They promote community and are not always just worried about where they are going to make their next buck.\nDriving is my part-time gig however the different programs and incentives they have for drivers has immensely helped me. Because of Lyft I am able to have a vehicle to not only use for rideshare butts personal use as well!\nA lot of people I know have second jobs very few people can say they actually enjoy going to work. It is fun, entertaining, and I am very grateful that I have the opportunity to drive! I have had some great experiences and made some long-term lifelong friends in the process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:16:40.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

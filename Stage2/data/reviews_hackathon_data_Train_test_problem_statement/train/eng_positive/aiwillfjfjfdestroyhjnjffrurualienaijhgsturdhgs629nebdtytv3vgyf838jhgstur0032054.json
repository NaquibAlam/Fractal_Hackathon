I did have to follow-up to request my rebate form but it was provided immediately.\nI also ordered glasses on line which I have never done before. I decided to go the cheap route because every time I get glasses it seems I can never actually see out of them. OptiContacts called me a few times to tweak my order. My only criticism is that the tweaks could have been handled in fewer calls and issuing a proper credit was initially overlooked. At the end of the day, customer service responds practically immediately, the billing issue was solved, and I received glasses that I can actually see out of that cost less than I have ever spent. Overall it was a very good experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:53:42.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

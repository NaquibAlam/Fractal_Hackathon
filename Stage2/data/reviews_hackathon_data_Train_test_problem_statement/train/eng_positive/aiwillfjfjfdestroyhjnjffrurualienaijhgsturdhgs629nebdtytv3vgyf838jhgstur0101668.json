Our Travel Agent was great: Allyson Mc Ginnis. She found us a Hotel that would take us for a month and set us on our way. We stayed at the Moana Sands Hotel, and had a wonderful time. They were very friendly, had a great Chef who cooked wonderful meals, taking top marks for his curries along with pork and steak dishes. We were on the beach with its miles of white Sand and it was like a dream come true.\nWe moved on thanks to the information given to us by the Manager and booked into the Moana Sands Villa's. They are two Bedroom. two Bathroom, tons of closets and\nroom for luggage, living room. dinning room. and kitchen area which had a two burner stove, Fridge and plenty of utensils, pots, pans, Dishes, etc.\nAgain, we were on the beach, walked outside to beautiful gardens, wonderful staff, who looked after us like family. It was across the road from a store that had a full service of everything you could eat, drink and lots of Ice Cream. There was even a place you could eat from freshFish & chips, Chicken to Hamburgers and a cafe where you could have Coffee, breakfast and a quick lunch. Everything, was wonderful and as I said service was exceptional. Rooms cleaned daily, and staff were ready to help you anytime, and we were sorry to leave.\nWe will be back again next year to try their new Hotel, or to stay in Moana Sands Hotel or Villas. Your sure to love this place and its wonderful Manager, Staff, Cook, and people who love to assist you whenever you feel in need.\nSincerely,\nDonna Lee and Harry Cassel.\nClinton, Ontario.

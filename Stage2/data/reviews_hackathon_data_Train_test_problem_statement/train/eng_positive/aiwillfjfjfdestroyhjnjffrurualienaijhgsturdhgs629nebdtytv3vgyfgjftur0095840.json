I spent a lot of time trying to find the best site to get one at and ended up choosing The Natural Sapphire Company. Building the ring was easy and fun, even for someone like me who knows nothing about rings. The ring came on time, which was great, but it had a prong that was fitted to the ring. We were only two weeks away from the date I was proposing, so time was very crunched. The company paid for return shipping, fixed the right, and then overnighted it back to me at no cost. Caitlyn was really helpful throughout the entire process. The ring ended up being exactly what I hoped for and exactly what she was wanting.\n5 Stars from me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:20:09.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

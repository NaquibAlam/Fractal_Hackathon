Purchases have been mostly watches and crystal. Have been completely satisfied. All watches are authentic and exactly the same as those you would buy in expensive retail stores. Have taken several to jewelry stores and watch cleaning professionals who have all verified authenticity. With the crystal, I have ordered many Swarovski pieces large and small. Had only one issue when one of the largest pieces had a piece broken off when I opened the box. Notified Jomashop and they replaced it quickly and without issue. Excellent customer service. I should also note that all my purchases have come complete in original boxes. Again no difference from retail stores. Only difference is the price.\nOne last note. I do a lot of on line shopping. Probably 80% of what I buy is online, so I have become proficient in online price comparison. Have never ever found better pricing anywhere else. Even if I did, I doubt if I would move from Jomashop because of the trust factor and outstanding customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T03:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:16:40.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

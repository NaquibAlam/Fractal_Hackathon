I was impressed when I found the top I wanted was available in the quantity I wanted. I placed the order, only to be contacted the next day to say that there was only one, & one the next size. I allowed the bigger top to be sent after being told there was only a slight difference, barely noticeable. I have found that to be totally incorrect, & now have a top which I'll hold until next year when one of the boys will hopefully fit into it. To get the top I wanted, I've had to order through another company. Your pricing is very good, compared to this other company, but your info about what is available needs to be accurate. I would have looked for something different if I had have realised the trouble I'd have to go to, to get two tops the same.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:24:02.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

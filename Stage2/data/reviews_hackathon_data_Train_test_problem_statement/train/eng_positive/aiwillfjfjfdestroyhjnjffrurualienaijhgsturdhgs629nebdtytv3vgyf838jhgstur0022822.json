I called the company seeking assistance in ordering 100 8GB \"clip\" drives. We are a fast growing healthcare e-commerce company.\nWithin a few minutes I received a call from Nick, who promptly took my information and FedEx'ed to our office an impressive media package which included an array of products you offered. We changed or thoughts from ordering the clip drives to wafers.\nI emailed Nick on February 21 the art work/design we wanted on the wafers. Within a few hours we received the proof and we were so pleased, we quickly placed our order. We received our order on February 27, 2017. They are perfect! THANK YOU Nick and crew for incredible customer service - It's a rarity these days! We will definitely recommend your company AND will order again in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T11:00:14.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

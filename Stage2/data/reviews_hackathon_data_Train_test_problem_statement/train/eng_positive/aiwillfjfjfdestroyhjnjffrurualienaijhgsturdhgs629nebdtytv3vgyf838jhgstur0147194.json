Customer service was easy to contact and helped us to resolve the issue satisfactorily. When I order multiple items, I do not like so many items delayed and back ordered. When this happens the total credit card amount is not charged until the entire order is shipped, which is understandable; since the partial order is delayed because of unavailability or from being shipped from a different location, the item ought not to be charged until actually shipped, but the \"chopped-up\" shipments cause confusion with my credit card payment and prompts me to choose ordering only one item at a time or none at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T10:08:38.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

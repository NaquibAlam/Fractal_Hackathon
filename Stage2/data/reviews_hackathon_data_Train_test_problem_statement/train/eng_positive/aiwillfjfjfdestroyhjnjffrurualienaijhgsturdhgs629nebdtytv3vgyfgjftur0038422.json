New models of rear suspensions, forks, gear, shifters: everything is made to be more attractive & should sell better.\nThe problem starts if you want to do some maintenance on your x year old bike. Glad \"You Tube\" exists: with some luck, a video explains what kind of actions, spare parts, special tools and other stuff are needed to execute the maintenance.\nHibike is the webstore where you not only find all those things, but also the different models of that part that came out. The chance you buy the wrong part is very low as well as the price you pay for it! The descriptions that come with the parts in the catalogue make the difference.

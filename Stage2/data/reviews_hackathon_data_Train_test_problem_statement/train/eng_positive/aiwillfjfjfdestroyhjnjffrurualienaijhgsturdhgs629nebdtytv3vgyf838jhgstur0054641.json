The easy-to-navigate website gave me the tools to create a custom-to-my-specs Logo for my small business in a matter of minutes.\nIn no time I had the professional marketing look and design that I had surfed over hundreds of websites to try and find. The color, images and custom design was right on the money for me and my small business. I am very impressed with the products and services that I had received from them.\nThey will continue to be a partner in my small business for life!\nTwo of the biggest concerns for any web-based purchases are \"Will I get what I thought I paid for?\" and \"If not, will someone help me with my after-the-sale issues?\" If they treat you the way they did me, you will get one or the other and your satisfaction of the purchase will be the end result.\nI purchased additional marketing items with my new business logo on them and the quality of the products have been far better than I had expected and the delivery of the goods was on time and in perfect condition. I will, no doubt, be ordering more items with my logo on them because FreeLogoServices has earned my confidence in their ability to meet and exceed my small business needs.\nSuperior Products, Excellent Service and Affordable Pricing makes FreeLogoServices your one stop shopping for a quality sales & marketing partnership for your small business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:59:41.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

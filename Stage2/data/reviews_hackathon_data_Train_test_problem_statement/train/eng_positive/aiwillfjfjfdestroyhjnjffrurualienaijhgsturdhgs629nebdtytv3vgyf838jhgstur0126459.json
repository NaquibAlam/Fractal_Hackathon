A recruiter called me for a position that sounded very interesting and I started the process of creating a new resume, with hopes it would take me about a week. I quickly realized that I was going to need help and based on the reviews, I thought Great Resumes Fast sounded like they would be a good fit. Kate was assigned to help me. I put a lot of effort into preparing for the interview as ultimately I wanted the resume to reflect who I am and to authentically represent me. Kate and I discussed my background at length, my motivations for updating my resume as well as personality traits. When the resume came back, my expectations were exceeded. Visually, it was clean and crisp but comprehensive, avoided stale terminology and old styling, but I think best of all it marketed me strongly while staying true to my experience, which I was struggling to pull together on my own. I had a trusted mentor review the resume, leading to some minor revisions with a few other career highlights he suggested to include, but he was impressed with it! I also had my father review it - he writes professionally and is an old school grammar stickler - and he was impressed that the resume didn't have any common grammatical or vocabulary mistakes. Finally, the HR Head at the company contacting me mentioned what an excellent resume it was and I landed the interview - during the interviews the resume was the perfect springboard for selling my experience. All in all, I couldn't be more pleased and would (and already have) recommended Great Resumes Fast to friends.

I can only think of one remotely 'negative' experience with Foodler, where there was an order processed & charged on Foodler's end, even through it wasn't processed on the restaurant's end. I was compensated with a full refund, in addition to Foodler bucks, so I really can't even complain about that. I love the variety that is accessible through Foodler. I love that there is a point system/rewards through the use of purchases on Foodler. I love that some restaurants that reward Foodler bucks when you make $100 (doesn't have to be all at once) in purchases with places that you love to eat from anyway. There are just so many perks and benefits with Foodler. I wish that I were a celebrity so that I could endorse Foodler because I seriously love it that much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T06:11:31.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

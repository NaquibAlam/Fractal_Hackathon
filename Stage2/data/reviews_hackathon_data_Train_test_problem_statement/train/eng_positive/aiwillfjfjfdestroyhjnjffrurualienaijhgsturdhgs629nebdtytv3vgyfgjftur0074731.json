It was amazing! From start to finish, Arina made sure every detail was taken care of. She even helped find us a beautiful spa in Lima when we had an 8 hour layover and said that we wanted to use the time for some self-pampering before going home. Our guides, accommodations, everything were wonderful, and we didn't have to do anything to plan. Would recommend this to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:02:13.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

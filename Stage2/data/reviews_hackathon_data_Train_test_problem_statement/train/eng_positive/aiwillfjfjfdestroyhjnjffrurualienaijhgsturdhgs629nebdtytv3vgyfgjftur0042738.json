I bought a new Zanussi oven from Dave In your Naas store. We had the zanussi service engineer out twice as the oven door was scalding hot and I had two young children. In black and white the service engineer pointed out in the manual that there were allowances of an oven door to reach up to 80degrees which is what my external door tested when the oven was on 200 heat. I burned my hand and had to put a fire guard around the oven from there on. Between Dave and Kirsty in electrical in the Naas and their customer service colleague, HN agreed to replace the oven for one that was fit for purpose with no fuss at all as they appreciated my dilemma even though the manufacturer was covered in the manual . It was refreshing and a surprise that it was made so easy and as a result I cannot commend your team highly enough for putting the customer first, its a rare occasion now days . Well done and that is more valuable than a cheap price!! Dave is a brilliant customer facing person and is a real asset to your business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:59:54.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

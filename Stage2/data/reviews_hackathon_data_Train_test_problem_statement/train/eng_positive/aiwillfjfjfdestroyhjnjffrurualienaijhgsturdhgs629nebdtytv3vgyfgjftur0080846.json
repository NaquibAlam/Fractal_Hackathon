The sale was processed smoothly although we dealt with 3 different people during the purchase. Each person was available when required. We did not like being pressured to book our first service on the spot through Motorama. Even though this can be cancelled, perhaps a text closer to the service date would be more appropriate. The extended warranty seemed geared to a long term commitment as 12 months was expensive and I am a silver member of RACQ which provides adequate emergency assistance. No one enquired as to our RACQ membership status. If they had, the benefits of the extended warranty could have been promoted better by Motorama. The emphasis on the costs if something major went wrong made us feel pressured to take the offer. Overall we were very satisfied with the sale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:08:57.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

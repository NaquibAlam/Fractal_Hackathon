Looks great from what I can see right now, looking forward to mounting on my cargo trailer as soon as it warms up. Initially had seen these awnings on an Australian trailer website and then saw a local Canadian supplier at the Toronto RV show. Ordered directly from Hitchweb and will be looking forward to ordering again. Would recommend them as a great supplier and easy to deal with. Thanks for the great service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T20:14:53.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

From someone who has also used Western dating sites in the past, I can give you my honest opinion of both. I find with Western dating sites, most of the women on their are indecisive in respects to what they want. You'll find that also, most of whom that are in their late thirties to early forties, are disingenuous when it comes to what they want. The only site that truly work as the ones you have to pay for, that's my experience at least. At least the women on their know, to some degree, what they want in a mate. As for CuteOnly, one thing that caught my attention immediately was how all, if not most of the women, were all beautiful. Also their less indecisive, they know what they want in a partner and aren't afraid to let that be known. You will find that a small percentage are insincere in their motives, but given the amount that aren't, well that becomes negligible. One other thing I should add is that the site is quick to remove scammers from their site, which rarely happens but it does sometimes. I am happy to see that the site takes an interest in their users safety and well being. I've met a number of beautiful women. a handful of which I am conversing with still. Now it's just a matter of filtering through that handful and focusing on that one individual, which I see happening soon. The other good thing about the site is that most of the women aren't attached to another site looking to get them all married off to a rich westerner. No, the women on this site I find are looking for love above and beyond money or for someone to take care of them, that's been my experience with these lovely women. I am taking a break from the site now that I've exchanged personal information with a number of women. We now communicate via phone and email as well as Skype. For any man out their looking for love and not a gold digger, I in all sincerity recommend CuteOnly, you won't be disappointed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:15:00.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

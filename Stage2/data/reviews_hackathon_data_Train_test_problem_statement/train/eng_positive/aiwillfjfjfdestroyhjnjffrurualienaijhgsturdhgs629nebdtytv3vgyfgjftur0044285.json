When I selected the boots I wanted to purchase, I had a quick look around for a sales assistant to help and at that point, the security guard, who was passing by seen that I was making my way towards the sales desk and he said to me he would alert the customer service people that I needed some help, which I thought was pretty nice and I was impressed how observant he was, very friendly thing to do. Once the security guard told the sales assistant to come down to me, I explained to Ruairi what I needed the boots for and he agreed that I had selected the correct kind of boots. I told I had a match the next day and I needed the new boots for the match. After Ruairi returned with my size he processed my transaction using an All4One gift card I had, no problem whatsoever. This guy is a really good fit for this job, he's knowlegable and friendly too. Ruairi even wished me good luck with the match the next day as I was leaving, which I thought was a nice touch. I was very happy with the customer service I recieved in Terryland. Keep up the good work lads, I will be returning the next time I need sports gear. Thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T13:33:49.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

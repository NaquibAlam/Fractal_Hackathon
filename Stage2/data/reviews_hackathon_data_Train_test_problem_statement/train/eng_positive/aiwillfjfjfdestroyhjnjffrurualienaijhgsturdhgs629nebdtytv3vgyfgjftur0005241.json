I was using the service under the free trial period and was not aware that I had to cancel by a certain time on the last day. After I told him my story, he did not give me a difficult time at all. He explained to me about the time that I need to cancel by, the option to customize my plan, and the opportunity to save any candidates prior to cancelling the subscription. He was very friendly and not pushy at all. I do want to point out that the terms of service is misleading but the company compensate with great customer service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T21:10:52.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

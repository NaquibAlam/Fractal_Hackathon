Nice gesture of a gift from my Sister-in-law but trurthfully nothing I'd really use as would have to go to one many miles from my home and then alone. It sat unused in a drawer for 5 years until I came across your site. I was checking on line to see if the spa card was still good and literally stumbled onto your business. To make long story short, I went to your site and was able to validate the card and receive an offer from you within minutes. A short moment afterward I received an email with a prepinted label for envelope which included postage. All I did was go to my mailbox drop it in and wait. Received a check from you all within one week. This service you provide was amazingly fast and easy. Couldn't be happier and your offer to buy my unused card from me couldn't have been more fair.

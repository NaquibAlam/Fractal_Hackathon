I asked for a 4 night stay including flights to Amsterdam for the following week and within an hour or so had booked. We were given a choice of hotels depending on budget, went for the best one and was still better value than elsewhere on the web. The hotel, Hilton Double Tree was fantastic, 5 minutes walk from the station, large room and the food was excellent. Will always use Dial a Flight from now, so much easier than spending hours scouring the Internet for the best deals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T10:38:02.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

At first I thought it would just be a way to get an alarm and save some money (compared to all the other companies I looked at). But wow!!!! This system is top notch. Not only do I feel incredibly safe inside my home once I activate the system, but I love the countless other features that I have or have access to upgrade to over time. Cameras inside and out, thermostat, garage door opener, lights... it can do everything. All the functionality of a more expensive systems at literally a fraction of the cost. Simply couldn't be happier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T12:00:18.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

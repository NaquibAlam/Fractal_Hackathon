We started at 3 meals a week, but quickly increased it to 5. Meals come beautifully prepackaged, and ice packs over the meat stay frozen for days. We love the variety of meals. I have yet to see a repeat. After reviewing many meal delivery services we felt this one was the best since we are a \"meat and potato\" family. There is a meat, carb and veggie with every meal. I love that I don't have to stress about what to make for dinner and cuts down on grocery shopping. It has also exposed us to different ingredients we normally wouldn't have used!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:44:05.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

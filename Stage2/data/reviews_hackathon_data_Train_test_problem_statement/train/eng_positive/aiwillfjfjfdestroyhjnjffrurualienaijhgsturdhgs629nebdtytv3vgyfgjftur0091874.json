I decided to send them an email about the said parts and within a short while I received a very welcoming reply from Mikey who asked me for additional info about my car. He then passed my request to the relevant department and within an hour, I received a very interesting and unusual email from Ciaran Duggan.\nCiaran expressed regret for not having my items in stock and went further by recommending three online companies that may have them. This was a very caring gesture which I found to be most helpful. I have since written to the companies and am awaiting their response.\nI shall certainly call on Micks Garage again, as well as, refer my relatives, friends and colleagues in the U.K. and in Jamaica.\nKeep up the good work and many thanks for going the extra mile for me.\nKindest regards.\nCrafton Williams\nWilliams Guest Houses\nKingston 6, Jamaica\nwilliamshotelsjm\nTel.876-328 4094", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:08:34.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I didnt have to repeat myself half a million times to get my order through. I recieved my transmission in about 5 or 6 days. I intalled the trans and put the correct fluid in. After i installed the trans, i kept hearing a noise from under my 95 GMC Sierra 3/4 ton truck. My truck sounded like a school bus taking off. I called them back and asked if this was normal and if the sound would go away after a break in period. They informed me that was not normal and every once in a blue moon a trans will slip through quality check\nunfortunately i recieved one. They put a rush on a replacement trans and i had it in 3 days. I am very, very, very satisfied with this companys work and customer care. I will highly recommend this company with any of your transmission needs. Thanks guys and keep it up. Not many companies out there like y'all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T15:38:27.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

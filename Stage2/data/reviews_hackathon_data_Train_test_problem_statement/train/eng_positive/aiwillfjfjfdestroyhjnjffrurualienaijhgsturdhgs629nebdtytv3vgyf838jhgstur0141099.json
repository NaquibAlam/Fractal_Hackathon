Always prompt service and a quality product with an amazing low price compared to the options out there (Staples, Office Max, Office Depot).\nRecently, the cartridges I ordered did not work in my printer. I called and within a few days I had replacements at no additional charge. I sent the defective ones back in a prepaid box so they could figure out what might have happened. I am very impressed with their caliber of service!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:26:29.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

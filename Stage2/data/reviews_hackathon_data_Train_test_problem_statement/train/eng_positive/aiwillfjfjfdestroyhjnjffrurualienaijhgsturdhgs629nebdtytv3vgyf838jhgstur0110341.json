Always an amazing experience. The service is outstanding. Heather always responded to my emails almost immediately. She emailed me suggestions and advice, and was so helpful with my upgrade process. She took the time to learn about what I wanted and found me the perfect setting. The stone - all I can say is wow! The sparkle is incredible. It is just so clear and bright. I can't stop staring at it. I can't say enough good things about this company. The diamonds just don't compare to any other I've ever seen.

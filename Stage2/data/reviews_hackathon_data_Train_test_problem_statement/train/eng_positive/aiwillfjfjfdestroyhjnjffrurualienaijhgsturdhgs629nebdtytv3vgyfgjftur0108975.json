There's very little wait time when I call with a question or a new vehicle or a claim. Claims are addressed promptly and thoroughly.

I was so glad I had CalCas comprehensive coverage! I heartily recommend CalCas for your auto insurance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:06:39.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

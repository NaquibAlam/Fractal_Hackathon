The cabin was beautiful and well maintained. We fortunately had amazing weather that contributed to the beauty of the views. We found it funny that a tourism web site stated that among the top ten things to do in Tennessee in the winter was stay in. I can see why, with the views and amentities that this cabin provides why would you want to leave. But leave we must, the weather was sunny and mid. 70's. The cabin was close to everything and was an awesome starting point for all activities, hikes, horseback riding, shopping, and drive sightsing. We will most definitely be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:16:55.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

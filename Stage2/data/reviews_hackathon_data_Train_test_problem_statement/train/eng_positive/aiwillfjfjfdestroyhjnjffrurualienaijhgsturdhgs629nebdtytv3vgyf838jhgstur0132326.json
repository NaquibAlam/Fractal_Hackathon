I'm not sure if I'm suppose to talk about the dealership (Carlotz Greensboro) or what, but when i first got there no one was there to greet me. They seen me walk in and that was it. So i almost walked about, but i really wanted to check out the car. After that it was friendly. It was a little speedy, but maybe it was due to the time i got there. Only advice i give to any car buyers get a diagnostic before purchasing the vehicle to ensure you're getting a good deal. Make time out for that. TrueCar buying services was fine i did get the price / lower that they advertised. I would recommend TrueCar nothing was hidden.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:59:18.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Their prices (after shipping) were competitive or better than other sites. I like that I can put books in a wish list to revisit later. I was also able to add books that were out of stock for order later. The website even tells you how many of a given out of stock book thrift books averages every month which is helpful in knowing how long I may need to wait if I want to order from them. Great website, great experience, I'm sure I'll order again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:23:52.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

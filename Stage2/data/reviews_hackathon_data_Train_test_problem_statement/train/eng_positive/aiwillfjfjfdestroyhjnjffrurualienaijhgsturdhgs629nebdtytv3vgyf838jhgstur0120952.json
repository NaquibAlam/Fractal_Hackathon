A lot of their items are cheaper than the US luxury retailers and department stores. If you make a purchase over $200, they offer expedited shipping and it gets to Seattle within 4 days for sure. That's quite impressive considering that it's coming from Quebec(?). I never had a bad experience with SSENSE and always happy with my purchases! Their return time frame is somewhat limited but I understand. Return shipping is also free and they process it very fast. It does take a bit longer when shipping back bc it's not expedited but I could care less about that.\nI like how I don't have to pay over 9% tax for expensive things. There is a foreign transaction fee (since I am ordering from US) but I use my credit card that waives all foreign transaction fees so it works for me.\nSSENSE has a lot of brands and their selections are great! I do like Nordstrom, Bergdorf, Saks, and etc but shopping on those sites can be tricky because they carry way too many brands.. and they have really low price range brands to high price brands. SSENSE still has a lot but it's not overwhelming and the brands they carry are very consistent.\nI do wish SSENSE would have a better filter option for shoes though.. I can only use size filter for sneakers so if I'm shopping for pumps or something, I basically need browse the entire thing. It's not all that bad but it can be time cosuming and I end up liking other things while browsing (haha). They also don't have a system where you can set your price range but I'm sure there is a good reason behind that.\nAnother thing is.. I believe their online store has less brands than their physical store. I really wish they had Balenciaga and Prada available on line. That would make SSENSE 1 times better.\nOverall, SSENSE is awesome and I LOVE their sale season because I found some amazing items for 30-50% off. Best part is most of the stuff on sale are actually very classic which means you see the exact items for full price in the US.... so save yourself some money by shopping at SSENSE. I really don't get why some people say SSENSE is overpriced.. I compare price for everything when I'm buying something nice and SSENSE is always my #1 option.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T11:14:34.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

And a lot of items (!) are available on their shop.\n2 out of a lot of orders (about 80 at least) showed shippment issues. But: I just used the feedback and customer service available on their webshop. One package was lost on shipment and was resend, even though I did not had an insurrance. And the other time one item was missing in one package and guess what: it was resend quickly.\nSo: yes. The shipment from Hongkong to Europe makes troubles in very rare cases. But with a partner like banggood.com there is no issues with that. The customer service did not asked for tough and solid prove; just an email and some photos of the package was necessary.

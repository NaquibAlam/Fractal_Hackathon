As a host I am here to provide accommodations and service and in return earn an income.\nIt is the property that collects money from the guest, not Booking.com, they simply provide the means of booking. So if you can't get your money back then it is your review of the property that counts. People read property reviews, before booking.\nDouble bookings --- This is my biggest problem. About 95% of the people in the country where I live, do not show up for reservations, nor do they cancel, and they lie saying they will be there in 2 hours then don't come. Hence, I don't hold rooms for people more than 2 hours after check-in, unless I have a deposit.\nI know my policy causes those of you who are considerate problems, unfortunately the number of inconsiderate people have forced my hand in order that I can achieve the objective of earning a reasonable income.\nCustomer Service -- Booking.com at least has a phone number to call. Much better than another site I host on.\nAnd yes, I have my frustrations, but for the most part they try pretty hard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:20:52.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

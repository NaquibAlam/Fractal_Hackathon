As rent is a non negotiable monthly bill. I was always stuck choosing between grocery or paying off other bills. I was really stressed about all the creditors calling me non stop and could not negotiate anything with them. Most times I would borrow money to try to pay off bills so I could have a little left for food. After meeting with Veronica at David Sklar, she was able to help get a proposal done to consolidate my bills. Thankfully they negotiated with my creditors. I only make monthly payments to David Sklar and they take care of the rest. Veronica has been really helpful, kind and never judged me on my situation. She even helped with teaching me how to save and start a new with repairing my credit score. She's always a call or email away,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T18:47:17.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I am from Canada, so many of the sites that I tried ordering from could not fill my request as they did not accept a Canadian billing address. (Don't know why??) Since I do not like giving out my credit card number, I was very happy that they also accepted receiving money from my pay pal account. Another Plus!!! In addition, their selection was very appealing, plentiful, as well as their competitive pricing. I was very impressed by that! I have to tell you that my grandkids (ages 3 & 1) LOVED their mishloach manot!! They walked around the house with them and wouldn't put them away. (Candy tray, funny glasses, and candy pacifiers). I will defiantly use this company next year too and of course for any other occasion when I need to send something abroad.\nFrom a very satisfied customer from Toronto, Canada.\nSincerely, Dina Frisch-Israel", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:29:35.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

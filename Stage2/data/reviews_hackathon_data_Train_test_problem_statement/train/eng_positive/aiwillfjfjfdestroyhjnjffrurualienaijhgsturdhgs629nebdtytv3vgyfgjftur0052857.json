I found OneSimcard and with an old flip phone found on eBay, it worked great. The PEN was a god send and made it easy for us to stay in touch. Since then, I have travelled all over Europe including Russia, the Baltic, Italy, the UK , Mexico and the Caribbean and never had a problem. I highly recommend this as an affordable option for any international travel and having the US based PEN is a great option!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:59:27.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

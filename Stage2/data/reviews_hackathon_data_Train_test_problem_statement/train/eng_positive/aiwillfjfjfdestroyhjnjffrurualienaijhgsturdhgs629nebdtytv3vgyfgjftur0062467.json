The only thing I can even complain about a little is how the books where shipped. I ordered 8 books and got them in 4 or 5 different shipments. Of course, I loved the fast shipping and sending what was available quickly. But at the same time, they could've saved on shipping materials if all 8 had been shipped together. However, the packing they use is 100% recycleable, so that helps. Bottom line, awesome company!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:36:33.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

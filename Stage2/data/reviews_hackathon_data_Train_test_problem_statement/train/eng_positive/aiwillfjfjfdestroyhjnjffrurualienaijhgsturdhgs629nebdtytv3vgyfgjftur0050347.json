Every month around the 13th or 14th I can expect to receive my shipment of fishing lures from them. The value of the lures far exceeds how much I'm paying for them and, being new to fishing, I haven't even used some of the types of equipment they send. So it's always a delight to make my way out to the water to try out some new stuff. I'd highly recommend them to any dedicated or hobbyist fisherman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:59:58.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

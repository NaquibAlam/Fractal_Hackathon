Having a 50% off coupon code, I didn't hesitate to buy the dress. The dress came today and was absolutely beautiful! It looked just like the picture and was amazing quality. The only downside was having to have it delivered to the UK. With £27 shipping AND £57 importation taxes, I almost had to pay the same cost of the dress, again. However, this is understandable, and after trying on the dress, it's definitely worth it. I would recommend this website to anyone who is having any doubts about purchasing online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:24:17.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

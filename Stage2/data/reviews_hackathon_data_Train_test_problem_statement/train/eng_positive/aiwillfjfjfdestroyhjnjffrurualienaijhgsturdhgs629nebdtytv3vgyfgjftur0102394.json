The ordering is easy, the delivery was really quick and the price is good compared with other label places. The labels themselves work great and I think the package choices were pretty good. But - we were hoping for more design choices for his age group. Lots of little kid stuff, but as you go into the older packages there are just plain designs and colors - but not many things like the peace sign designs we chose for him. A few more older kid choices would be better - but we like the peace sings and we're happy with what we got.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:44:58.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

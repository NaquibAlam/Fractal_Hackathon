We flew, we were bused and taxied, and we walked and walked. The planned events and tours were interspersed with \"free days,\" that enabled us to discover our own interests and to give us some down time, when needed. All the Sheraton hotels were great 4- or 5-day homes, and La Cantera Jungle Lodge in the middle of the jungle near Iguazú, was really a special treat. Our guides and drivers were experts who made our outings well worthwhile. Salta surprised us; we both thought it was the highlight of our vacation. Every city was different and had its own particular offerings for us: Chilean wine tours, Pablo Neruda's house in multi-coloured Valparaiso, Santiago's history, dazzlingly presented in the architecturally outstanding Museum of Memories and Human Rights, hiking to the top of the Parque Metropolitana, and then to the top of the Castillo Hildalgo on Santa Lucia Hill on hot summer (January!) days, both good excuses for the delicious ice cream that is available everywhere. The ride through the Andes into Argentina was stunning, and pretty exciting (terrifying?) as our bus driver made our way through the \"29 curves,\" all hair-pin turns over the precipices of the the world's second highest mountain range. Mendoza gave us the best meal of the trip, at the beautiful Francesco Barbera Ristorante, and a taxi ride that became a spontaneous guided tour of the Parque General San Martin with a driver in his sixties who could answer any question about the history and environment of the place -- in both languages. The tour from Salta to the famous Quebrada (ravine) was preceded by our long walks around the old part of town that led us to MAAM, the Museum of High Mountain Archaeology, dedicated to the information about the Llullaillaco centuries-old sacrificed children discovered in a mountain. With its haunting South American music and the actual mummies in view, seeing this \"miracle\" in the museum was our most memorable moment. But the trip to Humahuaco valley was perhaps its equal. Our cameras were exhausted by a day of photos of the mountains in colours that can hardly seem real. There is no need to talk about Iguazú, known for its over 250 waterfalls in the jungle. But certainly the flora and fauna (coatis, caimans, birds) there are worth the visit as well. The site is well-run, and safe, despite the distance down of the walks over the falls. Our last few days were spent in Buenos Aires, a vast city that has the advantage of exquisite parks, with blossomed trees, waterways, flowers, and benches in shady spots to rest on, all over the busy concrete and glass infrastructure that human existence has imposed. A so romantic parilla dinner in Puerto Madero on Rio de la Plata at night, and a spectacular tango (plus. . .) show and dinner at the Ventana after great hours of finding first-rate modern art museums were other perks. And let's not forget two trips to the colourful but somewhat marginal Boca district for souvenir shopping to bring back some South American gear for our friends and family. We will remember Chile and Argentina for the flamboyant colours of everything and the kindness of everyone we met.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T22:47:17.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

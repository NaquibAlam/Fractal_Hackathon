I knew of the website/service from other travel blogger friends who have served as house/pet sitters all over the world.\nI found the website easy to use. After I posted our need for a house/dog sitter and the dates, I received a total of 33 responses from potential house/dog sitters. Of those, 3 seemed like they would be a good match and we communicated via the site. We then narrowed it down to one, a mother/daughter couple. We have now returned from our month long trip and were very happy with our experience. Our house/pet sitter kept us informed with reports while we were away. We returned home to find our apartment clean and well cared for and, more importantly, to a happy and healthy dog.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:27:53.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

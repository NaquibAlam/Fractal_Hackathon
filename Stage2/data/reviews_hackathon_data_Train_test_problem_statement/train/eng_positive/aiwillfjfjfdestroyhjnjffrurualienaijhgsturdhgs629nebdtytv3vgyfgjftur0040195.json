We all have to remember that a lot of the things we order come from very far away. Anything can happen while in transit that might slow the delivery down or get the item lost. Not Tomtop's fault. These things happen. Even at your door. The product is delivered to your door, someone else see's this and it gets taken. It happens and it can happen to anyone. Its the chance you take when ordering online as i do and will continue to do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:07:31.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

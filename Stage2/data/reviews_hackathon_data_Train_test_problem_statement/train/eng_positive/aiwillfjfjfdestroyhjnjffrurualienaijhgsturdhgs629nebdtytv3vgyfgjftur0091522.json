And my only complaint is how unkempt the sitter's house was. College student who just could not have cared less. I have loved every person who has cared for my pet and used several of them again since I compete in martial arts in the same cities over and over. I was very pleased with the way Dog Vacay handlerld a situation in which a cat came into a sitter's yard and got into a scuffle with my dog. They were very concerned and proactive and ready to care for him. Thankfully he didn't need it. I also needed a refund once and it was taken care of right away. I would be lost without Dog Vacay to help watch my precious Tae Kwon Dontae during those few hours when I cannot whilst traveling with him. Most appreciative of their services!

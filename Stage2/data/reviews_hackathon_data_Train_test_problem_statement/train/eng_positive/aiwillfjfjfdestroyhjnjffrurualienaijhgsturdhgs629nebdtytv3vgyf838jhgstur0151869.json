I think only twice or so was a book ordered not available when the time came to pack and ship. They have a large stock and the catalog is fairly easy to navigate (altho' the search engine could stand improvement), with lots of helpful information provided for most modern-era books. The Want List feature is extremely handy to keep an eye on future purchases or simply to make a record of books you might want to buy again as gifts for friends. And there are auctions for rare and collectible books -- I only have limited experience with these, but it's an alternative to eBay. The next aspect I want to investigate is \"Buying\" -- I need to see how this might be an option for me to sell some of my collection (and put some of MY rare collectibles up for auction) as a simpler and preferable alternative to eBay.\nGrading is generally pretty accurate, in my experience, altho' sometimes you just can't be sure if some of the \"Good\" grades from the Sixties and Seventies are going to be a bit better or worse than expected. The one time I had a disagreement over a book I received, it could have been easier to obtain a refund -- it became an argument about what sort of defects should be noted in the description and should constitute the difference between \"Fair\" and \"Good\" -- it became a bit of an \"Yes it is\" \"No it isn't\" sort of dispute, and wasted a lot of time over a five dollar book, since the shop's position was that they wouldn't accept a return for refund unless they believed the book had been unfairly graded. So that attitude could stand some new thinking, maybe, but that was an isolated incident, and perhaps it will not happen again.\nMany newer, lesser-demand titles can be found for much less than the cover price of a new comic today, so it pays to hunt for bargains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:14:20.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

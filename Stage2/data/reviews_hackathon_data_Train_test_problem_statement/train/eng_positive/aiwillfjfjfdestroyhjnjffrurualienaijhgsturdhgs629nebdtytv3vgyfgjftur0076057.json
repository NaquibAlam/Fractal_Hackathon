Unfortunately, our regular agent was not available (on leave) and we got transferred to another agent, Kia Young. Kia was nothing short of AMAZING. She called us back right away (time was an issue because we wanted to take advantage of a promotion that was ending soon). Kia booked our trip, got us a GREAT room, an amazing upgrade to our room and even gave us a substantial shipboard credit! Any time there was action requested and/or a change to our cruise itinerary, Kia notified us right away. Kia also made sure to follow-up with me personally for each and every question I had. I would definitely recommend Affordable Tours.com and Kia to anyone interested when booking their next vacation!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:09:18.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

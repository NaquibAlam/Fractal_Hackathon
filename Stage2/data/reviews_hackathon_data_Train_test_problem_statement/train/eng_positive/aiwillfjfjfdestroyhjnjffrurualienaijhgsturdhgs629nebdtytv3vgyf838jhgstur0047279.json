The rooms were clean but staff was not as accommodating . Over all though we really appreciated our drivers and guides, all were very helpful and friendly. We did run into issues with ATM's not being accessible to U.S. funds in Costa Rica. Credit cards are always accepted, but if using cash, I would bring what you need with you.\nWe would definitely recommend Goway to friends and family, they take the guesswork out of a trip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:19:02.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

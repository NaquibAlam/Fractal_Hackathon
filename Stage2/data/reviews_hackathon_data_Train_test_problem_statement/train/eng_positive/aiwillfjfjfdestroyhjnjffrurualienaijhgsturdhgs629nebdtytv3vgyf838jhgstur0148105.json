Sent email to tech support. Received reply within minutes with suggestions of things to try to tune optics and offer of phone support to test laser tube after optics tuned. Support called within minutes of my email saying I was available (I am on west coast, Boss Laser is on east coast). Support tech (Allen) patiently walked me through test steps including connecting test equipment (in tool kit supplied by Boss as part of laser purchase). After doing tests and sending some pictures for review, Allen called back and said he was sending a new power supply and after installing that if problems continued would see about replacing tube at reduced price (laser is out of warranty ). When I first bought my laser I was a total neophyte to lasers. I had several occasions to contact Boss tech support with questions regarding set up, settings, software, techniques, etc. Received fast response every time by email and/or phone. Every response accurate, instructive, courteous, and (where needed) patient. I learned something every time, the equipment was tuned and/or made right if there was a problem and it was done quickly. We visited Boss Laser last year as part of an extended road trip. Spent two hours chatting with a sales rep. just to learn more about techniques, materials, etc. Very pleasant, relaxed interaction with lots of information and no hint of rush even though we basically dropped in on them.\nBuying a laser unit is just the beginning in a relationship with Boss Laser. Everyone at Boss Laser wants you to be pleased with your purchase and earnestly works to make your equipment work well for you both now and for years to come.\nI enthusiastically recommend Boss Laser to anyone considering purchase of a laser unit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:58:26.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

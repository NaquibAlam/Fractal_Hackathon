There have been at least two, maybe more instances their lead said we didn't need to spend the money to fix something we thought we needed repaired and gave us a clear explanation why. I recently had a major problem with my vehicle and they went over the top for me to diagnose the problem without an insane cost. They have been straight forward with my wife and have never tried to take advantage of multiple situations we have been in which is why we say Greg, Don and their crew are our mechanics at Cottman of Louisville on Taylorsville Rd are our family mechanics. I've never dealt with any other auto shop that has my full confidence and trust on how they handle my vehicle and money. They always ask and discuss before a penny is spent. Thanks, I'm glad we found you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:59:18.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

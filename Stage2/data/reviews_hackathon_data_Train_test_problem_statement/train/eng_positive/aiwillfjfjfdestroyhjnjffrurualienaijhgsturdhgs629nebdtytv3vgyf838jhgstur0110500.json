Before joining TrustedHousesitters, I employed numerous pet sitters with varying but always terrible results (including the death of a dog). I've used TrustedHousitters 3 times so far and every experience has been positive. I recommend them to everyone I talk to with pets. I can't say enough good things about this company and the system it has in place. I will never go anywhere else to find care for my pets. I look forward to a long friendship with our most recent house sitter who lives on another continent and whom I never would have met if not for this incredible company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:34:41.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

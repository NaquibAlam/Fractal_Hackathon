Both selling vehicles and now buying one. The reason... it is quick, easy and reliable.\nI started searching 2 weeks ago, I used carsoup, cars.com and carfax for my search. Carsoup had more vehicles return than the other sites. I found the vehicles, saved them as favs and contacted the dealer through car soup. After narrowing down the field, I test drove 5 vehicles in 3 different locations and now I have a new car.\nThat is the reason I will recommend this to people and use it myself.

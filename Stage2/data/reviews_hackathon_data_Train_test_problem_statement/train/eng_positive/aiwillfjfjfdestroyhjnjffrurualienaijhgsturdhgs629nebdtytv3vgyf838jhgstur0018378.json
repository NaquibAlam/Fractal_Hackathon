We simply sent the link with our invites and watched the money come in. I loved that you get an email notification everytime someone gifts you with the amount and name. Also you can thank your guests straight away. Fee is very little. Only complaint is it takes them at least 5 days to make the cash available to you them the bank takes another 2/3 days. In reality it took almost two weeks to get the money. Not ideal when most of your guests gift you on the week of the wedding and you are using the money for your honeymoon. They say it is a fraud check but I have never experienced this ever online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T09:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T16:45:10.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

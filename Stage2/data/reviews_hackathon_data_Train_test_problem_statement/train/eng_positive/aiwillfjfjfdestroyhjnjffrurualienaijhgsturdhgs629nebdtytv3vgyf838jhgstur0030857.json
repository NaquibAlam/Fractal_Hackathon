I really love how the site is organized, with a solid search engine that saves me time when I need something fast. Audio tracks include the waveform, so I can see stings and tails if I need them. The audio library is huge, and there are some great pieces in there that have worked perfectly in my productions. The AE templates are a game changer when you're in a crunch. Well worth the money in time savings alone! Highly recommend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T02:07:44.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

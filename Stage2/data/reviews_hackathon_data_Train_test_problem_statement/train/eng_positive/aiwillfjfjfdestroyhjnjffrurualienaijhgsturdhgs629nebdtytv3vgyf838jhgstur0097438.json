After trying to sell the tickets through friends and social media, to no avail, a friend suggested Ticketmaster Resale. Such a fast, easy process with the ability to request the dollars I wanted. Ticketmaster kept me updated throughout the process, tickets sold quickly and money deposited back into my account with absolutely no problems or time delay. Thanks Ticketmaster and would highly recommend this to anyone with unwanted tickets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:02:48.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

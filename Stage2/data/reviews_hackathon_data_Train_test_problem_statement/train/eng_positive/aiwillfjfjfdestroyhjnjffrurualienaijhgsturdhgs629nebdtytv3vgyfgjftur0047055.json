It's visually more appealing than a fence and doesn't confine our yard space. I had a great experience with the company as well. Dub was very friendly and explained the net well when he came out for the Quote: . Lavandis and Mike did a great job with the install. They were friendly and patient when explaining the net and walked me through it a couple times to try it out. Marty from the office was also very nice and helpful. Overall great customer service. So far my toddlers are afraid of the net so hopefully they will stay away from the pool now.\nThank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:33:44.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was stuck in NYC after learning that my passport was invalid to fly international because of my expiration date being less then 3 months out upon departure. I called the 24/7 line and spoke with an agent, had paperwork ready and waiting. Went in the next morning at 6:45 and had my passport ready for me at 5pm. Just in time to fly out that night at 11. Super grateful for all the professionalism and dedication to making my trip happen!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:10:52.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

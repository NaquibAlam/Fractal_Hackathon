Very efficient. I would definitely purchase from them again. I bought a Christmas gift for my husband through Country Attire. The website is easy to use. My order qualified for free 24 hour tracked Royal Mail service. I had an issue with receiving my order due to my office sending it back in error which I hadn't realised. Country Attire customer service acted promptly and contacted me immediately to ensure the item got to me by Christmas. After Christmas I had to return the item due to it being the wrong size. I ordered another size, and returned the original item which had an extended return period for Christmas orders. As soon as the item was received by Country Attire they emailed me to confirm they recieved it and my refund came through to me days later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T09:38:08.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

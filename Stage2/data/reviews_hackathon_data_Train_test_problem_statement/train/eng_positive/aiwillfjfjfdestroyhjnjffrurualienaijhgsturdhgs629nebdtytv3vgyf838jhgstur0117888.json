That 5 years is in itself a testament to the value that voices.com provides. As a full-time, working voice talent, I consider voices.com a valuable part of my yearly marketing effort and budget. I've worked with some really terrific people through the site -- some of them project managers on the voices.com staff, and many others who are creatives, producers, marketing professionals and small business owners who posted projects on their own and hired me directly. I subscribe (or have subscribed) to a number of different sites with a similar function (essentially, introducing voice actors to those who need to hire voice actors and vice versa). Although none of these introduction services is perfect, in my opinion voices.com does the best job overall.\nSteve Freedman\nhttp://www [dot] SteveFreedmanVoiceTalent [dot ]com\nSteveFreedmanVoiceTalent [at] gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:59:38.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

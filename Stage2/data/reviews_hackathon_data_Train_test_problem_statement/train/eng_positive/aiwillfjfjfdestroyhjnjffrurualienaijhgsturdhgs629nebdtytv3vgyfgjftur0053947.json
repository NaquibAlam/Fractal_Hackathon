As I was browsing through their many options of glasses, there were too many that caught my eyes but I knew I could only choose one. After that, I decided to keep this website at the back of my head to come back whenever I needed new glasses again. Basically, this store has officially become my go-to place. Usually, I'm a very wary person of websites because of the tremendous amount of scamming that happens online, but this one by far is absolutely trustworthy. I ordered my first new pair of glasses and noticed I put in the wrong eye prescription so I decided to return them and was pretty sad about that. HOWEVER, they were kind and considerate enough to give me an option to pick out a new frame without charge. I emailed them and they were pretty patient about my situation. That person that I've been emailing is Kate and she is AWESOME!! Shoutout to Kate, thank you so much! : )", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T17:11:28.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

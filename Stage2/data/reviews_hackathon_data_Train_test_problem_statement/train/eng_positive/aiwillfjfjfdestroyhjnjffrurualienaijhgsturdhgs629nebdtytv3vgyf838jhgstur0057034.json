Well, I got a surprise call from Alice Cooper at Finance2U, and from the start of my application she has been absolutely awesome.\nAlice, is very professional, friendly, confident, knowledgable of the company policy and car loan enquiries. Alice has restored my confidence with financing and impressed me with how polite and courteous her approach was to educate me about my credit report. Alice was helping me find a car, I found a few ideas but in the end she found the car I was wanting!! Alice considered my affordability and preference of car.\nI will be back after 12 months of consistent payments to potentially upgrade... I will be requesting Alice as my broker. Thank you so much for all your help and for taking away the stress and hassle of finding my car.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T23:06:46.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

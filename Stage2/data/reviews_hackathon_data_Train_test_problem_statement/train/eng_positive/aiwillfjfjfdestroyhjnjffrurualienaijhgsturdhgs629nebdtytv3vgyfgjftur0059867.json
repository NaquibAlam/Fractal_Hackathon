I'm 19 and not great with travelling so after booking I read so many reviews saying they were untrustworthy and was really worried about this! People booking hotels and hotel didn't even have booking. I swear this is so stupid. Do what I did and contact the hotel directly if you're scared!! I emailed hotel 3 times to check they received payment and reservation which they did. Also signed in online to United Airlines to check if my flight existed and paid for and it did. Also took out insurance privately. People only post about bad experiences but I swear I wouldn't judge too quickly! I was scared up until the first day of my holiday and we had a fabulous time at a great price with transfers included and it was all worth it!! Thank you last minute for letting me be one of the lucky ones and letting me enjoy my holiday! Would recommend :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:56:50.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

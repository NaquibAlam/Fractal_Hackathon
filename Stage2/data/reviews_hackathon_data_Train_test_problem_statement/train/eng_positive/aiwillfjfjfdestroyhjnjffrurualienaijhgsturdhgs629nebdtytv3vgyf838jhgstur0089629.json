We became DogVacay hosts two years ago when we had trouble finding someone/place to leave our pup while we went on our honeymoon. The kennel left the half grown pup alone in her crate for 12 hrs - too long - each night for 3 nights! We have soooo enjoyed being hosts, and have used it for our own pups. The dogs become one of the family, with love, hugs, play and couch time, just like your puppy. Our pups love having \"friends\" come play with them, or going over to our preferred host for their own vacay. AND it's a great way to make extra money. A dream job for me!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T13:22:49.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

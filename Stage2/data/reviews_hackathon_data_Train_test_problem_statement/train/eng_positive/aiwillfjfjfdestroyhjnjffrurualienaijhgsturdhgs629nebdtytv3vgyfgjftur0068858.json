Paying was easy, dispatched very quickly and received item that was well packed. Was disappointed with product as it had several paint defects dotted around frame. Two defects very obvious. Contacting Customer Support was very easy both by telephone and by email. Quick responses by email by the way. Customer Services very polite who asked for evidence (photographs) which I sent together with a discount request for the product. Mantel accepted the evidence but offered a discount well below what I requested. Despite another request Mantel held firm with their offer hence proving to be tough negotiators. I really wanted the frame because it was the last one they had in stock and I could not find another one anywhere else at all (I think they knew that). Reluctantly I accepted their offer and have since built the bike up which I truly love. I have put a sticker on the obvious paint defect that will always remind me of Mantel and of (I have to admit it) their professionalism, tough negotiating stance and really good customer service.

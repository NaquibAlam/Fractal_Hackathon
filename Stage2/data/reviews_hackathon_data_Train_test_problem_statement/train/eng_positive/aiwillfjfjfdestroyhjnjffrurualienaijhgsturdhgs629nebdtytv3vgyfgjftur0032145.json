We were due to pickup the car at Christchurch Airport, when we arrived we tried to ring the 0800 number but because we had British phones this didn't work. We managed to contact them on our hotel phone the next day and sorted out picking up the car. We lost half a day of our holiday but were given a cheaper day rate to cover the costs of taxi fares. The car was good value for money and got us to Picton ready for the ferry. Possibly the use of 0800 numbers could be looked into when people have a \"foreign\" phone, it was mentioned that this had happened before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:41:46.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

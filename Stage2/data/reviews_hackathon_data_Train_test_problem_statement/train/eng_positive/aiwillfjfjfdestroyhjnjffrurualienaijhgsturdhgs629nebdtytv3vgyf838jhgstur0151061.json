Finally, one day, I decided to try a frame web site. After a couple of tries, I settled on American Frame. There are several things I like: They have an excellent selection. I usually use metal frames, but have recently selected wooden frames for specific pieces. I have been very pleased. You can get the entire project taken care of. They handle every aspect of framing, from matte board selection to supplies. They are timely in delivery. They have discounts for large orders, which I often have. And, the icing on the cake: They are nice people! Friendly and helpful. I've been using American Frame for about two years, I think. I will continue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:19:14.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

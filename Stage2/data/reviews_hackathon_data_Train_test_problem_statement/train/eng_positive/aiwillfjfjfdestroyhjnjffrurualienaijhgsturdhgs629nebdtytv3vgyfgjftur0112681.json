Researched a lot and went to Home Zone after visiting another furniture store. The prices were much better and quality of furniture about the same as higher priced chain. Bryan helped us and there was no pressure. Ordered the furniture and it was in on date promised. Picked it up myself. Had to make 2 trips but the young man working in the pick up area was awesome! He helped so much and was very polite. The furniture looks great and seems durable so far, Time will tell. I was pleasantly surprised with the entire transaction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:30:14.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

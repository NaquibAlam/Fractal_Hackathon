The feedback is useful and the process is generally painless.\nHowever one thing bugs me. The new interface when you login has no top menu, you are brought to the last bunch of emails and it can be frustrating to navigate to other areas because of this. I wish the top menu bar was returned so it was less of a choir to move around the site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T17:25:25.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

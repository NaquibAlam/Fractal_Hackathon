I can see the difference. I wanted to learn Turkish a lot more seriously and needed help. The community and tutors on Italki are fantastic. Fantastic to an extent that they make your language goals so much more realistic and doable! I strongly recommend this place for all those who are not just language enthusiasts but also people with a great urge to connect with like minded language lovers and learn more & more :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T17:28:05.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

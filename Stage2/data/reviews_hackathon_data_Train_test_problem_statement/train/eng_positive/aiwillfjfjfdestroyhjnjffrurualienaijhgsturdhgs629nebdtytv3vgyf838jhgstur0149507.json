I was hesitant at first because the prices were so much better than in stores here in Canada. I thought I'd give them a try and I paid by Paypal so at worst I could get an easy refund. I gave them my prescription (which comes for free with the frames to a certain extent) and 2 weeks later my Persols we're at my doorstep. It was the real deal, and the glasses we're awesome. Since then I bought 1 other pair of glasses (Tom Ford) and 2 pairs of sunglasses (Saint Laurent and Tom Ford). I was always 100% satisfied by the fast shipping and the frames themselves.\nI recommended this website to my friends looking for a good deal and they have always been satisfied themselves.\nPeople seem hesitant to buy glasses online. Just try the model in stores, take note of it and buy it here, you'll save loads of money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:23:29.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Great amenities, beautiful views and easy to get to! The lady working in the office was very nice, the men....well, not very personable. The only issue with the cabin was the air hockey table was not working the best and I had to run down to the office to grab a puck, no biggie, the bedroom upstairs would have been better had it been more private, not out in the open with all the game tables. Those are the only flaws...will definitely be looking in to staying in this exact cabin again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:38:31.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

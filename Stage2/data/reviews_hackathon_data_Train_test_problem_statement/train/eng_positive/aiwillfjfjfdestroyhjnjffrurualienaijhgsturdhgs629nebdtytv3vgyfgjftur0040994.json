Initially I was told, yes they could fix it in about 2.5 hours. When I returned in 3.5 hours I was told that they had thought it was a Tab 3 because that's mostly what they fix. Huh? Anyway, they didn't have the screen BUT would order it if I wanted them to fix it. I said, \"yes.\" I got home to find a message from corporate saying they couldn't fix it. Yet another \"huh?\" The next day I get another call from corporate saying they could fix it but it would take 3-5 business days (about a week). Then, after only a couple of days I got a call from the local FoxPaw guy and he tells me my tablet is fixed! They say they fix Apple, Samsung, etc. but they don't say there are several models they don't fix. In my case, the tech didn't seem to know the difference between a Tab 3 and a Tab 4. In his defense, he did apologize and say it was all his fault but corporate doesn't seem to know what's going on. I think that they have a big communication problem that needs to be fixed. The right is doing something that the left has no clue about.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:30:23.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

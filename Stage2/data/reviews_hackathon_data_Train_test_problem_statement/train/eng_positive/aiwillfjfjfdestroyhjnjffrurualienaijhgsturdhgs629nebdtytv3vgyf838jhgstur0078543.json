My contractor pulled out the $400/piece pendant lights that we had ordered to find that they did not include the canopy that mounts flush to the ceiling. I called the company that sold me the lights and asked them about the canopy that was shown in the picture on line. They said, \"if you read the specs you'd know it didn't come with the canopy.\" I asked if canopies came with any other products and they answered in the affirmative. I asked if they couldn't just send me canopies for another product. They said they could not/would not. I asked to speak to a manager, they said the manager was \"offsite\" and would have to call me back later in the week. I went on line and found the canopies at OogaLights for $8 a piece and had them delivered 2 days later. OogaLights product and customer service for an $8 product was better than a high end lighting manufacturer for a $400 product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T11:16:31.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We do find the colours bland and the image options very restrictive. Girls like girlie colours combined with guy stuff and vice versa. Our kiddos also have their favorite animals (duck billed platypus, flamingo) but the image options are few and far between. If you decide to upgrade your options even tho we have our new labels, we would gladly reorder more.\nThanks for asking!!\nPS thank you for holding our order delivery until after we moved. That was so awesome!! Delivery was fantastic.

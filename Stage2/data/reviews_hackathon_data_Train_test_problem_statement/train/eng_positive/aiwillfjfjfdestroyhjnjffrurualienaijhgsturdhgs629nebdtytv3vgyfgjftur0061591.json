I liked the idea of having clothes sent every month but would have preferred to have the option if I wanted that commitment or not and still be able to get the 'your first two pants 2 for $24' just by becoming a member- I feel as though, if a company is confident in their product, that the consumer will be back to pay more for future products. I do like the options, the size and measurement options and the different patterns and styles to choose from. Fun, simple website and I felt confident in my purchases.

Couldn't have gone better when dealing with Upright Law at the core level. The local experience left much to be desired. I must have been very first case for the local lawyer as he did not have a clue as what to do. The supposedly \"One\" meeting to sign papers turned into 3 trip to his office of 160 miles roundtrip , for a total of 540 miles, to get the papers signed. There was one meeting where he was supposed to come to me where he did not show. When I showed up the last time the papers were still not ready. I had to go to a mall and kill several hours while he tried to get them done. You should make sure local attorneys are trained, and not by just sending them a manual. Once papers signed it went thru process as it should.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:04:48.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

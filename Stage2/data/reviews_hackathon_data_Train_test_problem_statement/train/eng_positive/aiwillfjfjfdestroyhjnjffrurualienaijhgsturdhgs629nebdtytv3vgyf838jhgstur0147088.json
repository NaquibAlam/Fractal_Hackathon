The car was clean, comfortable and trouble-free. ACE run a convenient shuttle to and from the airport and are only a short walk away. You pick the car up with a full tank of fuel and you return it with a full tank. A petrol station is just around the corner from ACE rental so no last minute desperate search for fuel.\nNo last minute spurious claims for mysterious damage that seems to plague some other rental companies, so highly recommended!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:18:34.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It should show regular price while shopping then the deal after the promo code is put in. I said 55% off the entire purchase but also said free shipping over $50.\nI wish it stated that you can only apply one promo code per order ahead of time and didn't imply %55 off your order and free shipping over $50. Either way though GREAT DEALS! As long as everything shows up within 3-5 days I'll be more than happy and will definitely purchase more. :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:22:24.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There were many skills required in order to overcome some challenges with my loan process. I would have preferred to be able to speak directly with the QL underwriting department. This I feel might possibly could have avoided misunderstandings, miscommunication and, confusion I experience as a result of there being so many \"cooks in the kitchen\". It was a very unique experience and the technology was unparalleled and still continues to amaze me. I appreciate everyone's infinite patience and dedication to seeing my loan closed no matter what the obstacles along the way.

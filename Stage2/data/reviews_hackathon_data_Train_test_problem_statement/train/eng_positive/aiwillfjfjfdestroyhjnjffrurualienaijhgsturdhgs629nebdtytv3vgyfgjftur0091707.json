I did not hear from the company or did I get an e-mail so I called. I was told that they were getting a shipment from overseas and not sure exactly when that was coming. It would have been nice to have had some communication from the company. Then I get a phone call with them asking me what my address was and that the rocker would be sent. I told them not to send it until the following week cause we were going to be out of town. They sent it anyway. Good thing Monday was a holiday and nothing was being delivered. The box came Tuesday and someone was home to bring it into the house. The packing was excellent and the quality of the chair was excellent. The product overall is great! However the customer service department could be better in their communication.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:56:35.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I subscribed for their emails on cheap flights for my return home.\nThey emailed me regularly and I was able to click on the link and go straight to the flights.\nI easily filled in all the details ,chose seats and specified meals. I could have even taken insurance to cover any cancellation or changes. I payed with my credit card. It took a couple of times to accept my card but when it was booked I was able to print everthing.\nThey backed it up with an email and as I joined the page I can go back in and find it on there as well.\nOverall it was a very smooth Ã nd stress free experience and I got a good price and the quickest direct route possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:40:28.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I'm a home cook/ hobbyist so im glad KM carried some affordable stuff a homesumer can invest in without breaking the bank. Also the price point didn't sacrifice the build quality it feels very solid in my hand. Also yanagiba's dont come sharpened, unless you opt for sharpening (no extra cost). This was fantastic and it came delivered razor sharp. Next on shipping, i ordered this on the weekend. they processed my order sharpened the knife and emailed me a tracking number on Tuesday. I received my knife on that Thursday, which is great cause I only paid for the 3-5 day shipping and live on the opposite coast. can't wait to finish up my Minonokuni set with the kumi usuba and the deba in the immediate future (hopefully).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T18:24:22.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

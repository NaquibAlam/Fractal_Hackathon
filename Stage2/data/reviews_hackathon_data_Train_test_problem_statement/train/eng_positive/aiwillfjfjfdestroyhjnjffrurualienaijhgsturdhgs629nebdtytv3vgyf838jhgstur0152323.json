This time I thought Banggood deserved a mention. It's not about the item brought but about the delivery. The item was lost in the post. Banggood offered to have it resent. As this was probably not Banggood's fault I offered to pay 1/2 the cost. Banggood thanked me & said this was not necessary. I've had other items sent in the past that were damaged & they replaced them at no charge to me. Thanks for good service Banggood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T17:45:16.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

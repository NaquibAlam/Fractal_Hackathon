I have ordered the entire set with frames, mat, the acrylic (rather than glass window) and the set comes with all the hardwares to make it hangable less the hanging wires. I think I got it down packed now and am not afraid of ordering on line. The packaging is done superbly, they arrive very securely each time. I don't like paying for the shipping but once I start to unpack, I have no more reservation about the shipping expense. It is all quality packing. I can tell that someone put a lot of effort and care into the packing so that all the faming materials are in tip top shape when it is delivered and I appreciated that. If you are framing the art you love, be sure to get the non-glare type even if it is a bit more expensive. I think these frames should last a long time provided I handle them with care. Also, be super cautious, the acrylic scratches very easily. But I dislike broken glasses even more. They are worth it. I appreciate it and cost is half of what I would pay at our local shop. I order several at a time so I have to save all I can. Good luck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:49:00.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

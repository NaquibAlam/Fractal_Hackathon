I received my order quickly (placed it on 2/22, received on 2/27) Instructions were easy to follow, quality ingredients were provided, and my family enjoyed the meal. I decided to cancel because there isn't a way to customize the meals. My family doesn't eat pork, we rarely eat beef, and only eat chicken breast. One of the meals looks delicious but it came with chicken thighs. Luckily I have chicken breast in my freezer and I was able to give the thighs to a friend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:55:51.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Chris contacted me within minutes of an online inquiry with the pertinent information I needed. That was the beginning of a very smooth and productive search/purchase process, resulting in my wife and I driving home in a new Highlander yesterday. I can't say enough good things about Mr. Joseph; or should I say I can't think of one thing to say about him that is a negative. From my perspective, this gentleman is a huge asset to Wesley Chapel. I recommend that if you're in the market for a new vehicle, ask for him first. Simply put, he's a nice guy... friendly, very helpful, straightforward, and fair. Wesley Chapel advertises that they strive to develop long term relationships with customers. From what we've seen, they're doing it well... with people like Chris leading the way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T20:26:40.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Laurel Stegman treated my situation with the utmost compassion and helped me take care of getting the floor replaced. I had used L&M several times in the past and were always very pleased with the Customer Service that I received from them. When my husband and I bought our home in May, the entire house needed new flooring. At the recommendation of my Realtor (loved him, so don't hold this against him), we used Carpet America to put hardwood throughout the home with the exception of one bedroom. There were flaws in several pieces of the wood and after several, and I do mean several phone calls, they sent someone to evaluate. The first installer to come \"fixed\" the problem with wood putty. There were several boards that were split. I called to tell them that this wasn't acceptable as I had paid almost $10,000 for the floor. They \"agreed\" to replace 4 boards, but indicated they were doing me a favor and were quite rude about it. The 2nd installer came, but did not alot enough time to replace four boards, so only replaced 1. He said he would call me back in 2 weeks to come back and finish. He never came, nor did he call. At that point I refused to call them back. My husband passed away in December, and the floor in the one bedroom needed to be replaced and I did not want to go back to Carpet America, I went in to L&M with the hopes that they carried the same wood, They DID. Laurel and Morris came out and measured and I asked them if they could also fix Carpet America's mess. They were happy to help me. The floor was completed today and it looks absolutely gorgeous. Moral of the story is that I will never go to anyone but L&M for flooring again. In my previous home they completely replaced my kitchen floor under warranty after 10 years. They are the best and their customer service is superb.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:56:20.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

He is in an aged care facility and the option of having a phone in his room was going to be very expensive with no discounts for his calls -- including overseas and national calls.\nI purchased this phone in order to keep him in touch with friends and family and to limit who he could call... he was constantly calling people and bothering them.... as dementia does to people.\nOk so now he is mostly happy (I am amazed at the simplicity of the phone) with his phone. No one calls me he says well he leaves it in his room so not much can be made of this problem.\nBack up on the phone has been fabulous and prompt.\nWe did try many phones, trying to adapt them to his needs etc but none were as satisfactory or complete in this process.\nthank you Dennis and your company.\nchrissie", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T09:27:10.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

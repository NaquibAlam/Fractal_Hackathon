At the checkout, I was not given the prompt to put in the promo code so I couldn't get the discount.\nI had an online chat with a member of staff called Samuel. He was able to get me the discount on one of the products and explained that the other 2 were not included in the promo. I was pleased that I was able to make some savings.

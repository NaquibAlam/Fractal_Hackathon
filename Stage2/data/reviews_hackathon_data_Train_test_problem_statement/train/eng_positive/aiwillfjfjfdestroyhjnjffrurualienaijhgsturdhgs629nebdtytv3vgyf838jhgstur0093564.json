Patricia S. was very patient and worked with me. There is a $30 fee for their service to keep in mind, but after the puchase I checked the price on other sites for the SAME flights and I saved about $300 or more. If I had purchased through the major carrier, for the same flights, I would have payed $500 more. I also purchased the insurance, which was actually cheaper than I expected it to be, but of course will not know if it will be worth it until I get to actually choose my seat and obtain the information I need through their concierge service. They did not push me to purchase it at all. It was my choice. They work with major airlines and so far I feel that they care about their clients. I give it a 4 stars, because I haven't flown yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:42:07.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Very nice facility and the staff members ( 2 females) were very friendly, informative, and overall attentive! Got what we needed and was shown the unit and given all instructions and everything that is connected with Public Storage. The only thing I found that could use some work is the pricing and amount due on signage of contract. I got an email that gave an amount that would be due at time of rental. It was also a promotion price for the first month being $1.00. In the email it said what would be due would be 24.00 and some change. So i had the amount with me in cash. What we didn't know was we had to purchase insurance and the lock. That was not factored in. I understand about the insurance because there would have to be a choice of what coverage. The lock I would think the price is a standard price. It was a bit of a offset and i guess it was good that we could use a debit/credit card. We did find the monthly rental a bit steep, but inflation is understandable. Other then that it's all good!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T22:40:14.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

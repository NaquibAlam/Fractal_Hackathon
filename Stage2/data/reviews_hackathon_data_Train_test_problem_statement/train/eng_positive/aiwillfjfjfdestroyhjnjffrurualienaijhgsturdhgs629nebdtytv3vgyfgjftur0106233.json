Friday morning I was contacted by customer service because of a problem with the prescription that I had uploaded - they said it did not match my order. This was simply due to my eye dr's bad handwriting. They contacted the dr and verified the prescription that day, and approved the order. Because of that delay it missed the shipping cutoff for that day, but it shipped out UPS Monday morning and I had them Thursday (not bad for free shipping!). The boxes were in good condition and the expiration dates are 3 years out, so they are not old stock. I will definitely be ordering from LensDirect again and recommending them to my friends! The only thing I'd suggest is to put a shipping warning on the box that the contents are temperature sensitive and/or require a signature to prevent the carrier from leaving the package outside. I happened to be home when UPS came, but it was particularly warm here and he would've left the box on the porch in the hot sun (a few weeks ago it was sub-freezing for several days), potentially ruining the lenses if I hadn't been there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:31:04.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They are an affordable service to use with different types of plans, like a free trial, pay as you go, monthly, and VIP services. It is great to see that they can cater to all different types of requests and services. One of their greatest features is the DKIM, which definitely improves email delivery. There are so many scams out there and this feature helps make the email seem less threatening which can help a business owner detect from the good and bad emails. Great company and will continue working with Sendpulse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T18:20:06.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

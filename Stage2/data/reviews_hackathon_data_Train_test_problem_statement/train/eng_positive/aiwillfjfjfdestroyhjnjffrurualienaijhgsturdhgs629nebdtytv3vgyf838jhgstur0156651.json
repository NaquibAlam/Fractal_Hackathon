I explained my issue to a very polite service rep and the issue was immediately resolved as such the reason for 4 starts. To me a sign of a great company is one that not only has a great product, but even more so what occurs when/if an issue arises. After discussing the problem with her I admit my issue could reasonably have been interpreted by some as a misunderstanding on my part, based on ordering more so on the photo then the language in the write-up.

Certainly a top company and I will continue to highly recommend and do business with in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:08:58.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

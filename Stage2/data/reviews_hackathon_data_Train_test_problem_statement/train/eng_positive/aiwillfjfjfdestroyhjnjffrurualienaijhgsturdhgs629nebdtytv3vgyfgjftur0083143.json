I feel safe using this around my house, family and pet. I feel better using this, than plain water or chemical wipes. The only thing they need to make next are safe Magic Erasers!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:10:02.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We absolutely enjoyed all the excursions offered except for the wine tasting in Adelaide which was not as advertised. We did not see the enomatic dispensing machines and the whole tour was rushed. We would have preferred more time to see the actual city of Adelaide. We were taken to Hahndorf, a lovely village in the Adelaide Hills, but had no chance to explore the village itself. The other tours included in the tour were great, many of which we would not have chosen if traveling on our own but completely enjoyed. The only other complaint we had was not enough free time in some of the larger cities that we visited. (Sidney, Adelaide, Melbourne, Christchurch, Queenstown and Auckland) An extra day in these larger cities would have made the trip perfect! I would not hesitate to recommend Goway Travel to anyone!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:34:13.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

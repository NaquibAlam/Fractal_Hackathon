About 3 years ago Australia changed the visa requirements and I didn't know so when we arrived at the airport, my friend wasn't allowed to fly. I didn't want to go either so with only 3 hours before take off, I emailed Travelgenio to cancel our flights. I didn't think I would get anything back but it was worth a try. They processed my refund minus $200 per ticket which is nothing in the grand scheme of things and for something that was totally my fault. Not only that, once they approved the refund, the money came into my account in about 3 weeks without any further follow up from me. I was so surprised. I have booked and cancelled directly with travel companies and then had to chase up payments and then with threats I saw the money months later. I could not believe how easy Travelgenio was considering my past experience with other companies. I would definitely feel safe and confident to book all my future travel with Travelgenio. I really appreciate what they did! I can't thank them enough!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T13:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:29:41.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was a simple online transaction with no hassles. I never even spoke to anyone there... so not comfortable giving a '5' on so little contact... but no issues at all, ordered, item was shipped promptly, arrived one day late (I blame FedEx ground's estimates, not Beach Camera), and was exactly as described.\nWould definitely buy from these guys again... but just don't feel I had (or needed) enough contact or interaction to warrant a 5 star review. Part of me feels bad for that... but 'perfect' is handed out too often.\nOne could definitely argue that not needing any customer service was in fact great customer service. By that reasoning, you can adjust my review up to a 5 if you want.\nBut I hold 5's back for companies that go above and beyond. Beach Camera never had a chance to show 5 star colors in this transaction... not a knock against them at all, they may very well have gone above and beyond if needed... but this was too simple a purchase to get that impression of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:39:31.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

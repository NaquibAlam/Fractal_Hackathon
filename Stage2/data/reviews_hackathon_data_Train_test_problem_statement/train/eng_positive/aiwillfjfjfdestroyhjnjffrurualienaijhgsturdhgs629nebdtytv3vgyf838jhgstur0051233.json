We visited Florence for the first time with our friends. Tours by locals was easy and very efficient. Laura, our guide, met us at our hotel. She took us all around Florence and took extra care to find our interest. One of our group is a cabinet maker and she found a restoration place that was awesome. Can't say enough we had a great time she gave us tons of information and stories!!! Highly recommend!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T15:45:39.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

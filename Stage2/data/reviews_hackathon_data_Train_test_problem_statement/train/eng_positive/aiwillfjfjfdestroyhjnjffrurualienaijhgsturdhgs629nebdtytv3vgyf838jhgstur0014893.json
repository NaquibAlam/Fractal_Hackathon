We've worked with our rep Christy Bowen that entire time, and she's ALWAYS been attentive, courteous, professional, knowledgeable and just downright helpful 100% of the time. They have always seemed to have the products I need, and it's a pleasure to be able to call Christy, tell her what I need, and know it will almost always ship same day, at good market prices. The last couple years I have needed large quantities of pre-printed CDRs, and I found WTS to be fast to produce and ship and fair on price too. Having known Christy as my sales rep for all these years, I have begun to count her also as a friend, as I genuinely believe she actually cares about how we are doing on every level of our business. I have recommended them to others in the past and continue to do so.\nMark Reinhardt\nRhino Technologies", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:56:41.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

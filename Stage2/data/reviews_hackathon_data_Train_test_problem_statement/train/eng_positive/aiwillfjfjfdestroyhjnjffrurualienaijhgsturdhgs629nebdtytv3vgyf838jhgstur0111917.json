Because I am unable to PLANT the two fuyu plants you have sent me until early April, I put the trees in their packaging in a cool place in my house but I was uncertain about watering. When? How much? And I was unable to reach anyone at your company over the weekend to ask. I called on Monday and it seems I have over watered the trees in their packaging. I didn't know you had packed them with an absorbent surround and that I needed to add just half a cup of water. When I return to Connecticu on Thursday, I will try to empty the extra water out of the black garbage bag that surrounds the roots and trust that these large trees are hardy enough to survive in water they have been sitting in for 5 days. Again, instructions would have been very useful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:24:15.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

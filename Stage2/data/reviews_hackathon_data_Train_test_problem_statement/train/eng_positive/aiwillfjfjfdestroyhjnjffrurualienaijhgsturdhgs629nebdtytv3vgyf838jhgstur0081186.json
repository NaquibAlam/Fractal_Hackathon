I emailed customer support and they quickly provided shoe measurements. I felt more comfortable ordering, so I did. The boots arrived a few days later and they are a perfect fit!!! In fact it's fair to say they are the best fitting shoes I have ever bought!!!\nI am really happy with the support I received! I'm even happier with my Maison Margiela Tabi boots! They are stunning!😀👏👌👍", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T22:48:10.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Of them, few could compare in price to the Quote: s I got from PolicyGenius. Also, other brokers used tactics that were manipulative, stating they know all the major insurance companies and would argue what was possible from other brokers based solely on my weight and height, stating that my Quote: that I had was not possible. I never revealed where the Quote: came from and then in the end went with PolicyGenius. The insurance company PolicyGenius Quote: d me was an A+ rated insurance company. They helped to set up the interview with them, was approved, and I happy with my long term life insurance purchase for peace of mind, for me and my family. I would always suggest to shop around, but I think you will find PolicyGenius to be your best provider for life insurance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:23:14.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

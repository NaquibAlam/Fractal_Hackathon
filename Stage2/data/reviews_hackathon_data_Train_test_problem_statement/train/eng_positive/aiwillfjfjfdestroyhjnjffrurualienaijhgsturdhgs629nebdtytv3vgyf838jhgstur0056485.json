I purchased new tires in October and recently brought my mother in for tires. Dan Nieves was beyond helpful and made sure my car was in good hands. I was so happy with his help and my new tires that I brought my mother there when she quickly needed to get new tires. Once again Dan made sure we were in good hands. He had Tito help my mom. She had a set of tires picked out but Tito gave her information on a few other options and she ended up going with his recommendation. These guys are really great and Dan really looks out for his customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:25:14.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

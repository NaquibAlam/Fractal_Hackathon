I've been a Room-Mom (party coordinator) for my kiddos' classrooms since 2007. My first year, I used email to try and coordinate - what a confusing, time consuming mess. I then found Sign-Up Genius and it was like I found a personal assistant. I was able to have the fun in planning the party and then I would set up the invitation and list of items and volunteers needed, send out the invite to the parents and I was done.\nI have used the Sign-up to create classroom \"Gift Registries\", Conference Meals for teachers. School Movie Night volunteer shift schedules and so much more. A huge thank you to the Sign-up Genius team for creating such a wonderful tool.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T13:23:12.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Although my business is in a transition phase... from a sole proprietorship to an LLC, Keri gave me advice for a short term loan to help me with a cash flow problem, and told me what I needed to do in order to qualify for a 300k loan in 3 to 6 months that will help me get to the next level of growth. I felt comfortable talking with her and I plan on calling her back when I get my books in order. I had a 5* experience dealing with their knowledgeable and courteous staff, and I hope this leads to a very prosperous business relationship in the future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T23:14:24.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was really surprised when the very next day ( Wednesday ) the new part arrived with a stamp addressed envelope to return the wrongly supplied part. I think this company have taken customer service to a new level and from my experience I would recommend them to anybody, they are also very competitive with their prices I was 100% satisfied all round", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:12:23.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

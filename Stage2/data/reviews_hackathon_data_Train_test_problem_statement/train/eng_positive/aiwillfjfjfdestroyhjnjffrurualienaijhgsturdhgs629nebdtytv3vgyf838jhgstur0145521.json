I had an inquiry about renting a Fluke 754 this morning since one of ours went down and is in need of repair service. While it is out, we need a rental unit so that we can continue performing calibrations for our customers. She had a response back to me within the hour of my original online request, and then when I inquired about a different rate for the month, if applicable, she responded within 10 minutes. I couldn't be happier with the quick and efficient response time and information provided. I wish more vendors were as easy to deal with. Kudos to her and your team for always providing us with great service. We appreciate the partnership. Have a great day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T14:53:47.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

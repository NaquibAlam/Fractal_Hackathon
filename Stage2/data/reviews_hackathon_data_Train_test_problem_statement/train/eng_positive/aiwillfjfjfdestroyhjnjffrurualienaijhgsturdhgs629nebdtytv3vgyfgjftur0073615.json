I found out that YesStyle carried their brand, so I bought what I wanted and a lot of other items during their clearance sale! I spent a little over $100 for a pair of jeans, cute ribbon flats, 2 pairs of lace under-shorts for mini skirts and dresses, a super trendy plaid pleated skirt, 3 light and heavyweight knits, and a ladylike A-line dress and jacket set. I honestly can't believe I was able to buy so much for so little, as well as free express shipping, but it's possible through this website! Thank you, YesStyle!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:21:55.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

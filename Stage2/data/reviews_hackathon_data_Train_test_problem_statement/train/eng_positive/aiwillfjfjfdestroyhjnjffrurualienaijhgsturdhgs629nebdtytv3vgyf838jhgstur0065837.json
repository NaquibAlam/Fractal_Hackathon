I have ordered 2 sunglasses so far - Celine Tilda in black and Prada Minimal Baroque in brown. The only reason I didn't order the Miu Miu this week that I planned to purchase is because of the shipping issue I had with FedEx last week. Otticanet uses FedEx as its exclusive carrier in my area. I have some problems with them which I don't attribute to Otticanet, but it nevertheless prevents me from purchasing as much as I want to from Otticanet.\nThe main virtues of Otticanet are twofold: if the item is in stock, it will ship in one day as promised; and the item ordered will be new, authentic, and will include all the accessories which come with the item. My Celine Tilda, however, didn't come in the white paper bag that my other Celine sunglasses, purchased from the Celine store, came with. Nevertheless, the authenticity of the items sold being the primary concern, I didn't think the lack of a white paper bag was that big of a deal.\nIn terms of delivering your order to you, if you get a competent FedEx driver, you will get your order as promised or even sooner. For example, I ordered my Celine Tilda on Sunday early morning. Italy is 9 hours ahead of my time zone, so by the time it was 8am my time, my order had already been packaged and a label for FedEx created. By the next day, the tracking number was active with a delivery estimate showing for Thursday of the same week. Then on Wednesday morning, I received a FedEx delivery update stating that my package was going to be delivered that morning with a delivery window of 9:00 to 10:20am. This delivery went smoothly. I was extremely impressed that Otticanet delivered my sunglasses within three days!!!\nThe next delivery didn't go as smoothly because I must have had a filler driver working our area that day. I live in a gated community which requires a gate code to enter. The regular delivery drivers seem to always get in whenever they need to do so, but I received an email message from FedEx on the morning that my package was to arrive, stating in effect that my package was not deliverable because of a customer-controlled obstruction. After the second contact with customer service, we surmised that the driver must have been a filler and he didn't have the gate code, nor did he want to expend any effort in acquiring the gate code.\nThe third call to customer service added a plea to the driver to attempt redelivery that day and added the gate code and my cell phone number to the message. My package was not delivered to me and I received no call from my local FedEx office as promised by customer service. The 800 number would not release any contact information for my local FedEx office: no name of individual in charge, no telephone number, no email address on which I could reach a supervisor.\nAfter SEVEN calls to customer service, interspersed within an eight hour period, I finally was transferred to the local office that had my package and I picked up the package at 7pm. The item which was supposed to be delivered to me at my home before 10am was never going to get to me (not with the stunningly uncaring cast of FedEx characters in my area) unless I went to get it myself. It was a frustrating experience which greatly curtailed my desire to make additional purchases from Otticanet within a short amount of time.\nAlthough I have nothing but praise for Otticanet, the manner in which the item ordered arrives to you will greatly affect the experience you have with a vendor.\nI have no desire to relive any part of that frustrating day with FedEx, however, I know that I will make future purchases from Otticanet.\nI am also told through YouTube reviews that it's possible to be charged a VAT two weeks or so after purchase and that amount is charged through the same form of payment used for the purchase. It will be two weeks since my first purchase this week so I will look out for that possible charge. Otticanet does promise to refund that amount when you email the proof of a VAT charge along with their refund form.\nSo my final words are: Otticanet is awesome, sometimes the delivery method will hit a snag.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T11:41:50.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

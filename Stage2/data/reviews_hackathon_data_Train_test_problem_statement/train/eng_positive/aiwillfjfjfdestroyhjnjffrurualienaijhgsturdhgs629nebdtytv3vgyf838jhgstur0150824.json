In fact, we have kept in touch with 3 of our house sit homeowners and are now friends.\nWe learned a lot, had a lot of great experiences and we managed to accomplish our goal of staying places for Free but even more - to meet locals and live like locals instead of tourists.\nI have been referring people to Trustedhousesitters for almost a year now and think it's the most reliable system that I have used thus far to find house sits.\nWe loves and miss the animals we connected with and are looking at more opportunities over the next 6 months as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:18:45.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

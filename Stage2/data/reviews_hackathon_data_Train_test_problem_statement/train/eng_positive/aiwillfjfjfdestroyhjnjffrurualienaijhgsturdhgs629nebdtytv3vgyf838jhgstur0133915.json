The only problem I have is when Austpost take ~ 3 days to deliver. The other problem I have is if I happen not to be home when the Package is being delivered the person making the delivery takes the package back to his/her depot. This means I have to catch a bus into town the next day to collect the package. Very inconvenient when I am almost 78 yrs old.\nRegards\nDavid WELLINGS BOOTH.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T11:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T12:21:47.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

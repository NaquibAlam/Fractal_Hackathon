I didn't respond to the IRS because I didn't know how to. Then I received a letter from Tax Tiger and read their statement, it was \"we've earned our stripes\". I kept reading and saw a symbol of a fish and for me that was it. Being a christian I knew what these messages were stating so I called Tax Tiger and after a 30 minute conversation I literally felt a mountain of pressure and stress just get lifted off my shoulders. Tax Tiger took care of my tax problems and worked with me on their service fee. They were so efficient, professional, kind, informative, comforting and trustworthy; all the while providing me with astonishing and superb customer service. A huge thank you to the entire Tax Tiger team! - Ricardo Lopez", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T21:56:00.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

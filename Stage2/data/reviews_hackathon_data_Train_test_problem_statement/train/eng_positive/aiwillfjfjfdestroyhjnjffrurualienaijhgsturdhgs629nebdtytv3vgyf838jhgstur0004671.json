I Guess I Just Never Put Forth An Effort To , No Reason In Particular . However, I HAD To Share This Experience Of The Dress I Ordered For My NEWLYWED WELCOMING EVENT!!!! I Searched Through Many Sites , Hundreds Of Dresses . Literally, Dress After Dress. Still No Luck. I Must Add That I'm Not A \"Basic\" Type Of Woman. My Hair, Dress & Nails All Have To Scream \"I'm Here \" lol Seriously!!! I Went From Typing In \"Mermaid Dress\" In The Google Search Bar , To Typing It In On YouTube. I'm More Visual Than Verbal. Like, Let Me See lol Each Dress Review That Caught My Eye , I Read Through Their Description Box To See If They Entered Where They Actually Purchased The Dress. 7 Out Of 10 Came From PromGirl.com , I Changed The Search To \"PromGirl Reviews\" . I Was Amazed . I'm Very Hard To Satisfy But Man Was I Satisfied With These Gowns. I Then Furthered My Search To Their Actual Website. Girl .... When I Say THOUSANDS Of Dresses To Choose From, I'm Not Exaggerating. You Seriously Don't Know Where To Start . It Gets Better , You Can Filter Your Search By Color, Style, Shape , Event, You Name It . I'm So Blessed To Have Found The Dress I Pictured In My Head. Everything About My Dress Screams ROYALTY . I'm Telling You , There's S Many Dresses To Choose From I Promise You'll Find ONE That Has Your Name Written All Over It. My Dress Was About $338 Which Isn't Bad For Me Personally, But It's ALWAYS Quality Over Quantity. You Get What You Pay For . So Sla With PromGirl Honey. My Dress Came Within 4 Or 5 Days, And Its EXACTLY How It Appears On Their Website. They'll Even Help You Select Your Dress Size In Which I Didn't Know Mine. All You Have To Do Is Know Your Measurements. Teamwork Makes The Dream Work. I Only Had The Hard Tape Measurer For Hardware So I Measured Myself With A String , Then Matched It To The Tape Measurer And Wah La, Magic. It Fit PERFECTLY. I WILL Be Ordering Again. Hope I've Been Helpful In Getting You A Step Closer To Making You Special Day One To Remember! You Won't Regret It.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:38:57.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

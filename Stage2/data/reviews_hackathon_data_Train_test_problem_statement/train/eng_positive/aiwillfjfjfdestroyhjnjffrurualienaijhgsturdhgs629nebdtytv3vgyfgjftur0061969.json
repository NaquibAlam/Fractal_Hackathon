These are the first words that come to mind with my experience with Dr. Huebner and his team at Natural Transplants. The months and weeks prior to the procedure, Jerry did an excellent job communicating with me via email and phone. It seemed like his response was immediate, regardless of the time of day! I traveled to their Ft. Lauderdale clinic from Minneapolis, MN. Upon arrival at the clinic for my procedure, I was immediately impressed with how friendly everyone was. Even Dr. Matt Huebner was right at the front desk :) It may seem silly, but it really was nice not to have a stuffy receptionist and waiting room. I am in my 30's, and so is the majority of the staff at Natural Transplants. They made me feel very comfortable the entire time. Dr. Huebner is currently training two new doctors to grow his practice. Props to Matt's brother Tom, for his excellent work with me as well. I am at 3 weeks post-op, and healing great. I am confident with the work performed by Natural Transplants and would recommend them to everyone!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T11:18:54.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There was a mix-up that resulted in my tickets not being confirmed, and I was understandably upset because the price I had been promised was no longer available. Lookupfare supervisor Kolton Spears called me back within a day, apologized for the inconvenience, then went above and beyond to get me tickets for the same dates and at the same price I had before. After being initially disappointed, I would use Lookupfare again simply because they did the right thing and took care of us.

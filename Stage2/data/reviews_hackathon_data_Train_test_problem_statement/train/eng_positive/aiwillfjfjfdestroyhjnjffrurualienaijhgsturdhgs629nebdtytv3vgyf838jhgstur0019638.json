Was on a main highway and I heard a thump, and at that point remembered my phone was on my roof. Pulled the car over and went to play frogger in the highway and get my phone back. I watched the phone get run over a few times, which the last one pulled the case off of my phone. I picked up all 3 pieces (my phone and 2 parts of the nuud case). The only damage was a little bit of road rash and camera lense shattered. Phone still in working condition, and not even a scratch on the screen. The case was too mangled to put back on, so I went right out and bought a new one. Will never have any case other then lifeproof because of me being stupid and always dropping it.

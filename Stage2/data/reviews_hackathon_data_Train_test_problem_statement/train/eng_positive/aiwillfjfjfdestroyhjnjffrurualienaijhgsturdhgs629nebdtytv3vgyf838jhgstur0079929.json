LTDR, we sold quickly and their staff are awesome.\nWhilst we were in the middle of setting up our listing we got a personal call from the lovely sales girl who walked us through the whole thing because it was our first time. Once we were done, they had us up on realestate.com.au within an hour and shipped our sign the same day.\nInitially we thought our map was displaying wrong on realestate.com but the support staff explained this was just because we had chosen to hide the address (which meant the map didn't zoom to it) On finding that out, we changed our listing to show the address and the update happened nearly instantly on all sites.\nWhenever we had a question we were able to quickly speak to real people, and they were always happy to help, even on the weekend. which is a rarity these days.\nBest part was putting the SOLD sticker on our house 11 days later. Will definitely use them again when we sell next.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T12:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T17:50:27.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

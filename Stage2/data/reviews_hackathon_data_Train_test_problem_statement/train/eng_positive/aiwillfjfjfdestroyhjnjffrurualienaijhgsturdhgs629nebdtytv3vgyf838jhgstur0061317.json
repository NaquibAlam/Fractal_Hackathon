Response was informative and accurate, while remaining kind in their phrasing. Often times customer services can provide information but do it in such a way you feel stupid for asking a question, this was not the case with Helmet City. When shipped i received a text message from the courier and an email from Helmet city to advise the order was on it's way with accurate delivery times advised with-in. No one was in when the order was delivered but without being asked to the courier delivered to a neighbor saving me from having to mess around going to PO etc, which i really appreciate. All round i will recommend Helmet city to any friends looking to buy a new Helmet as the service i received was great and cannot be faulted at any point of the process. Top Marks Helmet City and DPD for a painless experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T17:16:28.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

However, when we got the red rocking chair home and started to assemble it, we noticed that one of the bolts had broken off inside it's bracket. I went to my local Lowe's and purchased a new bolt and bracket, then replaced the broken ones. There is no way this broken bolt could have made it through a quality control inspection. Which leads me to believe that one was never performed. I do not hold the salesman or store liable for this error but I will be sure to buy any warrantees in the future and hold the entire company accountable for future quality control issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T14:49:10.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

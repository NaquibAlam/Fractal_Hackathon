Great service. I bought a lower end tires and the first time driving it in the snow proved I made a mistake. They offer money back before 30 days. I checked when I bought them and it was day 36. I called the next day to see what they would do for me. Tony(the store manager) had me come in and showed me the difference from what I bought from what he suggested. I went with his choice and he was amazing enough to have me pay only the difference in price between the tires. They offer so many free things when u buy tires from them. Thank you very much Tony in New London CT!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:16:08.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

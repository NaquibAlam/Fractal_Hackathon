I recently ordered a Frederique Constant watch through the website. Before doing so, I called to confirm the watch was actually available. The person who took the call was very friendly. My watch arrived in perfect condition, other than that it was running fast. That was easy enough to get corrected by a local jeweler. If I had to give any cons, I'd say it took a little longer to ship than I anticipated and while phone calls are answered promptly you might be waiting a few days for an email reply. If you can live with that and the lack of a manufacture's warranty I highly recommend Jomashop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:17:46.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

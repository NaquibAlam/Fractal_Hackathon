Heck, I'm not even married! But I'll tell ya, Hello Fresh has nonetheless been a gift from the food box subscription gods. I tried signing up for that other one with the apron, and the website was annoying and the meal selections made me want to crawl under a blanket and binge eat chips and chocolate in the dark. I had almost resigned myself to takeout and pizza and pants with elastic waistbands until I decided to give Hello Fresh a chance. Website is easy to use, they actually let you pick what's in your box, and they use ingredients that I've actually heard of! The meals I've been preparing have been healthy, flavorful, and very filling. I'll keep receiving Hello Fresh and referring to my friends and family. Well done on keeping even my picky butt happy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:55:51.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was very skeptical and decided to try a small order. I only needed black ink at that time. I called to place my order and it was taken, no questions asked, even though my order was for less than $5 . I gave all the information needed to have my order placed on my charge account and received my order in just a few days. Living in Hawaii, we are always charged extra for delivery because we are not part of the continental US. Yes, I will place orders for my printer ink again and also tell my friends about my experience with Inkfarm. Not to forget, the very low prices can' be beat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:33:34.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

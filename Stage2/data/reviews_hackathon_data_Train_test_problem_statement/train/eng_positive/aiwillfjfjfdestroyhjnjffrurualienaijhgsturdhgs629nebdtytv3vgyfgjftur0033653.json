I was hesitant to use Bambi Baby at first due to never hearing about them, but decided to due to their reviews and prices. When ordering a convertible crib and dresser from them had a ups shipping issue Bambi Baby took care of and a damaged part was unable to be located by the manufacturer, but Bambi Baby followed up with the manufacturer after I got nowhere and solved the problem. Carolina was awesome to deal with in customer service. Everything looks beautiful and is ready for our first child. When mattress shopping it was clear who to use and our high quality Colgate 2 n 1 came with no issues from Bambi Baby and very well packed. Thanks Bambi Baby! It's nice to see a company today that takes care of their customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:41:43.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

If you need a book quickly however, you better do straight to the bookstore or order from Amazon, as it takes a minimum of a week (usually 7 to 10 days) to receive you order. However, if not in a hurry, I encourage you to buy from Thrift Books as the prices as about 80% less than Amazon and shipping is very inexpensive.

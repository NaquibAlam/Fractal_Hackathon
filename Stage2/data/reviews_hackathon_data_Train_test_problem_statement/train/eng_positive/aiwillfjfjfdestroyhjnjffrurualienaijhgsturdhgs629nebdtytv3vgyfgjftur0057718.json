The review on the websites overall looks good and it also listed as a google certified site. So we just ordered. The watch arrives on time, no difference at all vs. if purchasing from a store. So we are very satisfied. Fossil is a known brand and Jomashop is a genuine seller, as long as you know the product you are buying, you can buy from Jomashop! It also provides warranty which gives a sense of ease but usually I try to pick products that has good quality itself first. I definitely will recommend Jomashop!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:22:02.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

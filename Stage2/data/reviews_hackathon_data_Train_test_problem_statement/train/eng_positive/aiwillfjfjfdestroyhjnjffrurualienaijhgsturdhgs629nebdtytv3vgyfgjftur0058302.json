The website was easy to navigate and create the product you wish. The quality was tremendous with thick card stock and beautiful photo quality.

I recommended Optimal Print to some friends in the community and three others ordered that week :)\nGreat experience overall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:36:52.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Upon ordering, I received an email that the Generator I wanted was out of stock. However they could replace it with an upgraded one the #100155, a 9000 watt Generator at no additional cost to me. Of course I said yes, and in four days the Generator arrived, sooner than expected. After looking the Generator over it appeared brand new, with no damage, or scratches at all. Upon starting the Generator, I was even more surprised to find out the hour meter had zero hours, and it ran perfectly. We live in the Pacific Northwest, where storms are frequent, power outages are common place. I have only had the Generator for two weeks, and have used it to power my entire house four times. This Generator performs above and beyond all my expectations, and the dual fuel option is an added bonus. I would highly recommend you buy one if you don't want to be in the dark when the power goes out. My neighbors will definitely probably be ordering one in the near future.

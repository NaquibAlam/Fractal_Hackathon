Its a brand new car and assumed mats would come with it. But no! I refused to pay nearly Â£90 so I found Car Mats Uk and bought a black carpet set. They are perfect in every way. They fit perfectly and look great. They are made to a very high standard and at a fraction of the price. I'm so pleased I bought them as it adds both comfort and practicality to my car. I would highly recommend these. Thanks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:43:08.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

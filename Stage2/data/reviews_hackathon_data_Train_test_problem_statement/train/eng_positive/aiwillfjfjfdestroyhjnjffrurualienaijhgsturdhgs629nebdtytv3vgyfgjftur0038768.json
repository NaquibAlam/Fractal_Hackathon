I have been researching for two months regarding the different types of trikes and looking for a good entry trike as I am a beginner to trikes.I had a bad accident on two wheels and have not been able to get back on a bike and feel comfortable and enjoy riding again....until now!\nThere are no dealers in my area for me to test drive and I found out that TerraTrike offers a 30 day trial period to ride the trike. After many emails between myself and TerraTrike I made the decision to purchase the Rambler 24 speed due to upgraded components when compared to the Rover. However due to my small size at 5'3\" I contacted TerraTrike to make sure the Rambler would fit and decided to take the plunge and purchase it. I could not be happier with the delivery and the ride of my new Trike! The trike is fitted well to my size and all put together upon delivery to my home....just take it out of the box and ride!\nWhen I am ready to upgrade I won't hesitate to contact TerraTrike again. Thanks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:59:54.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

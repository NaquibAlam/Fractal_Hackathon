As I was doing all the work myself, I carefully researched everything I could. My experience in home remodeling was with my kitchen in 2006. It turned out good so I figured I’d tackle this bed to bath project.\nMost of my preliminary bathroom planning was done. When the project was initiated thoughts of having a TV in the bathroom was really a neat idea. Let’s say I watch a little too much DIY and HGTV. I figured if these people could put a TV in the bathroom, so could I.\nThe more I thought about this I realized the only good place for this installation was IN THE SHOWER. That didn’t temper my excitement. It fueled it, besides, why not?\nThe research began. I web searched “mirror TV”. The closest thing I could find was a mirror TV in a vanity. And they were all small. That wasn’t good enough. Through my searching I came across FrameMyTV.com.\nI had a tiny fear these people would think I was crazy. An email started the conversation. Dane was the first person I contacted. Dane demonstrated a genuine interest. Clearly, I was undertaking a DIY project. But Danes support was comforting. We talked about glass types and I decide to order the Mirror Sample Combo Pack. Dane replied back to thank me for ordering the sample and to give credit toward the future big purchase. Again she offered more support as needed.\nAs good as Dane was, she directed me to Kevin for some of the more technical questions. There were questions about the infrared remotes, whether tempered glass should be used and even if anyone had any experience with using Rain-X to reduce water spotting. Kevin showed keen interest as we discussed the myriad of questions. Despite all the “weird” questions, Kevin’s support was comforting.\nWhen I felt satisfied my questions were answered, I knew this project was a go. The TV was selected, purchased and a frame was designed. I ordered the glass. That was a big day as I knew there was no turning back.\nThe pictures show the final results. I have to say I’m really happy with the way this project turned out. I talked with many companies about this project. Kevin and Dane stood out with their support and I couldn’t be happier with doing business with FrameMyTV.com!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:30:34.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

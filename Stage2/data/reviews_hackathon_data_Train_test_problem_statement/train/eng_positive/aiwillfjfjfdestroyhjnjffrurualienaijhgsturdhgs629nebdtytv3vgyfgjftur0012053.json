Suffice to say this issue has now been dealt with in a professional and timely manner and fully resolved. It is so refreshing to deal with professional and approachable people - I would definitely purchase from Harvey Norman again totally off the back of their customer service being so good (a rarity these days)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:43:14.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

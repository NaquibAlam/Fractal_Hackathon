Easy to deal with, extended booking at the beginning of trip with no problems. Picked up car, Nissan x-trail 2016 in central location with only 4K on the clock :). Car had all the gear such as Bluetooth, reversing camera, trip computer, keyless entry and push button start. Was awesome to drive around the country. I am very pleased I chose this company and this car.

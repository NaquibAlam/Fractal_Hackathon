Add in that this was on Sunday afternoon, and my international non-refundable trip was leaving Tue morning. Really poor planning on my part.\nI search and found other services like rushmypassport and CIBT, but neither could offer a same day service. Actually their 24 hour service \"starts the clock\" after they received the filled out package and your old passport, which required overnight shipping both ways. That's a tricky way of defining 24-hours that really didn't help me; earliest I could get a passport was Wed morning (about 60 hours by my clock).\nAfter more searching, I found RushPassport.com. They had staffed phones on Sunday afternoon! Maggie answered all my questions in a direct and understanding way. She emailed what I needed; I emailed the package back in about 1 hour. The supervisor called me Sunday night at 7pm (about 3 hours after sending in) to confirm the package, explain how it would work, and asked that I come in right when office opened Monday morning. I did that, and it took about 15 minutes Monday morning to finish, including them finding and correcting a few items on paperwork; then I came back at 5pm and they had my renewed passport. Every step was efficient, with understand of what I was going through.\nNot only did I get my passport in less than a true 24 hours from the moment I realized I had an expired passport, their Same-Day Expedited service was the same price as the other not-true 24 hour services.\nHaving gone through this mess of my bad planning, RushPassport made it easy by giving me clear steps to follow, double checking my paperwork in person, and then doing the work to get my renewed passport the same day. I'm still amazed it worked as I now write this just after landing in a foreign country on Tue afternoon.\nThank you Maggie and Sam and rest of staff at RushPassports.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:11:07.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

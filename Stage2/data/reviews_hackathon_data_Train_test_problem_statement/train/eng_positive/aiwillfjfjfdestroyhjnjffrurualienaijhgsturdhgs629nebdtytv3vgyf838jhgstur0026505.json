I do my own cover and label art using their templates in InDesign. With those art files and my mastered audio files all that remains is to use their efficient and robust ordering system to easily start the job and upload the files. If you make a mistake in your order it's easy to fix without making the order crash, and the system gives you help along the way. Getting a bar code so easily is fantastic. Choosing the Mega Distribution Bundle before checking out will save hours or days getting up with a number of distributors. I consider their pricing fair for the professional level of quality, and their customer service makes you feel like you are part of a team.

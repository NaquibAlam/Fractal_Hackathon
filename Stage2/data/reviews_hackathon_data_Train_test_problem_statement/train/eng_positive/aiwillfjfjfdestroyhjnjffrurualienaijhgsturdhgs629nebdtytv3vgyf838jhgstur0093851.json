The new assembly cane with GREAT insulation around the wire leads so hopefully it will not burn them. That has been my problem all along. The wires kept getting burned I have been through 4 Pilot assembly's because the builder made the place for the pilot on the left side of the fireplace not the right so it had to be modified Long story but I think I am good now I have rapped the wires in welders cloth and covered them with sand, so far so good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T06:30:45.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

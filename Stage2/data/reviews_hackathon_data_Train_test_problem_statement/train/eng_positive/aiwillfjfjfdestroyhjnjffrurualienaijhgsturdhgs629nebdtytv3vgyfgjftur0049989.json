They explained the reason for the delay and offered to send a replacement or a credit for the damaged tie. In the end, great customer service (thanks, Lily!) but I still took off a star for having to go through all the hassle in the first place.\n--\nFirst, the ties I ordered didn't get here until well after I had ordered them, and definitely well after the date estimate the website had given me even with a backordered item. When I followed up with customer service about it (January 10, almost a month after I placed the order) I was given no explanation as to the delay and no apology. I was happy when I received the notification the day after I heard from customer service that my ties were being shipped, but I can't help but wonder how long it would have taken if I hadn't reached out to customer service in the first place.\nSecond, the quality of the ties I received was lacking. As you can see from this image, there are several hanging threads visible on one of the ties. I don't know if this is something I can just snip off without damaging the tie, but I don't think I should have had to even consider this at all. The other ties seem fine.\nI'm not going to go through the hassle of returning or exchanging the tie since the threads are thankfully not on a visible part of the tie, but I thought you should know that you have a very dissatisfied customer, and I think you can do better with regards to your customer service and quality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:44:55.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Apart from some minor fraying at the edge of the fabric we were generally happy with the product....I would like to see this dealt with and I'm sure it could be easily done.\nBIGGER PROBLEM!!! The paperwork that we were sent with the product agreed with the figures that I had given the company....however, when my husband put the blind up, they had reversed the measurements so that the length was what the breadth should have been and the breadth was now what the length should have been. Luckily, it was an outside the window blind and the window was nearly square, so we got away with what we were sent and didn't have to go through the hassle of sending it back and getting it remade....so the company's ability to deal with complaints was left for another situation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:31:39.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

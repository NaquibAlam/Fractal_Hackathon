I like to make the bottle cap sized picture stickers of my children and myself to place on presents or items of their clothing because they're too young to read yet. One time I made a mistake and ordered the wrong size and customer service was super helpful and took care of everything the same day. I highly highly suggest Evermine. Their stickers are of the highest quality and I've stuck them on clothing tags, water bottles, lunch boxes and they have great staying power. They've gone through the laundry and dishwasher quite a bit and stay on longer than expected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:46:50.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

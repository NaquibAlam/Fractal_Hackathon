I had an alignment done, but it still was not right, they balanced my tires, it still was the same so they rotated my tires and balanced them again. Unfortunately it still was the same. I took my car to my dealer they did a high end balance and found out I had 3 humps in 3 of my tires.. I tried to get road hazard from my dealer pay for the tires but it got denied.\nTownfare Tires paid for my high end balancing at my dealership, so I decided to go and get 4 new tires from them.\nDoug helped me through all if this, he was kind and patient with me, extremely helpful,.

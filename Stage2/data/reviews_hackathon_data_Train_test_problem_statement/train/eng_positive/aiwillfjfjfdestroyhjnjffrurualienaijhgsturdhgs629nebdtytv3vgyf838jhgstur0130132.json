She was refusing to eat anything, everything I tried she would turn her nose up at. Tails was recommend to me so I went to there website and ordered some food to my surprise they were offering 2 weeks worth of food free and I just had to pay the Â£1 delivery charge! Food arrived within the specified time and I had one very happy collie her first bowl was gone within minutes of putting it down. Food is deliverd to your door every month with a curtsey email to let you know they are making it and when it will be arriving.

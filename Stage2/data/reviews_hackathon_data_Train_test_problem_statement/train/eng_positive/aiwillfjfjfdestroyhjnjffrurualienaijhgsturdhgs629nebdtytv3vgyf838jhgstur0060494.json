Covers are top notch, stylish and more easily removed than on many I've seen when requiring a wash, with a strong zip on the back.\nI love that they have a built in isofix as they seem more safe than fixing with seat belts. The optional added cup holder is actually accessible for young toddlers too.\nOverall I am extremely pleased.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T00:22:34.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

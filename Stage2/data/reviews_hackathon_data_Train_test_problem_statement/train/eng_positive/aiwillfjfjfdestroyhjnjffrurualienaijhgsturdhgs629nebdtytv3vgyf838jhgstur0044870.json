It was a very efficient service. My husband found it a bit hard to put the bike together because there was no picture in the instruction manual that related to the particular bike. However, once I printed one off the internet, he was able to get it put together not back-to-front! It feels good to ride but it is early days. I am still getting used to it. Seems like a quality bike and I hope it lasts well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T12:21:40.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

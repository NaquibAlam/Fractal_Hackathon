Moved everything from my 6th floor apartment even though our elevator was broken. I just called them the day before when I found out the elevator was going to be broken and they had me hire one more mover. No problem. I couldn't have done it without them. By the way, not one thing was broken or scratched.\nThey are priced fairly and although it is possible you may find someone a little cheaper, but these guys are by far the best VALUE. A good and fair price and a great product. I even reviewed their contract and insurance. Very good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T21:33:56.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

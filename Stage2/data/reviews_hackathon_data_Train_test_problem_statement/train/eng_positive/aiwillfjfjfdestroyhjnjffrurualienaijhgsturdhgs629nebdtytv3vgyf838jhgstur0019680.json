Later I requested my credit card agency to look I can be reimbursed based on the insurance. But the logged the request as goods not delivered and reverted the transactions. Hitesh reach out to me proactively and explained to me what has happened.\nI had very limited options provided by my bank and credit card company to correct the mistake that they have done. Hitesh has worked with me and provided me with all the options as how to fix this problem, starting from reducing the total amount I need to pay by taking out the fees first (so that my losses can be reduced). Later he devised ways to so that I can comfortably pay for the disputed charges. He kept following up with me and keeping me up to date with the progress and also making sure that I am also working from my side.\nAfter I have made the payment, he has worked with the airline in getting a refund from the airlines (This was a great relief as this was a huge amount, atleast to me) . Now it is just a matter of days I will get my refund from the airlines.\nLeast I could say for Hitesh that he went above and beyond his role and provided me best customer support I have ever seen till date.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T00:02:57.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When I tried to fit them they had sent the wrong bolts so I used the old ones temporarily.\nA new set was sent out immediately I complained and arrived again very quickly.\nSubsequent to taking delivery & fitting I received a £25 discount offer which I will be unable to use because I have already bought a set of wheels. It is a shame about the timing because the extra £25 would have helped offset the major expenditure I had not planned for.\nI am very pleased with the end product and have sent some photos in for their marketing.\nRegards\nGeoff Williamson\nI Repair Your Computer", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:49:59.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

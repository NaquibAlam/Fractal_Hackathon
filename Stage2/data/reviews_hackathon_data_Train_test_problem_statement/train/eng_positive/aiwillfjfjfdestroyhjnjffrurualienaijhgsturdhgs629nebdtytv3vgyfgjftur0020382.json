I did so and ordered a pair, I paid a little extra for a Saturday delivery.\nThe boots arrived as expected on Saturday, the box was battered but as it was inside a plastic carrier this is expected with the usual heavy handed delivery drivers. The boots were not inside their protective bags which is how Loake would ship, the boots had clearly been tried on previously by another customer with some of the stickers peeled off. The boots would have been returned to Country Attire who sold on to me. This did spoil my first impression but as I could not get a size 11 anywhere else at this price (Â£245 - 10%) I kept them, anyway their first trip outside will mark them.\nOverall I was impressed by the price and service, just tarnished by the fact that for a pair of expensive Loakes things should have been perfect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T09:11:01.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

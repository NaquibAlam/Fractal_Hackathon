That said, I had the opportunity to meet a couple of people and really spend time figuring out what the best option was for our [complicated] situation. I am confident that what we got was the best we could have found, and it took a LOT less time and effort than if I'd been trying to coordinate all of that on my own! And once I had the person coming to my home and taking care of my dog while we were gone, the check-ins and photos and after-the-fact reports were so comforting. I felt like we were well-covered by the perks offered (ie. if something happened to our caretaker while we were gone, Rover would provide a sub with no additional work or stress from me, and the insurance is comforting as well), and the whole process generally left me feeling so much better about a difficult situation. And I think the total additional cost of doing it through Rover was like $12 (above the charges for the caretaker, which were on the reasonable side of industry standard), which was super reasonable considering all that we were doing and all the perks we got. Well worth it, and so happy we discovered Rover!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:33:35.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

For years, I have searched antique and other variety stores for a replacement base and always came up empty handed. At Antique Lamp Supply, I not only found a replacement, but I had multiple options. She is going to be so excited this Mother's Day. I highly recommend this site for anyone hoping to find a unique replacement part for their lamp.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T11:13:51.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

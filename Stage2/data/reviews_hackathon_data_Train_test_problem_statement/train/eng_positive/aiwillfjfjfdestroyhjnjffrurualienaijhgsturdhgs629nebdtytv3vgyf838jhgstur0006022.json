My daughter was a straight A student, doing well academically but she was very unhappy with the amount of distractions, fighting, ungodly peers, and being bullied by boys who made lewd sexual comments to her. I had already been researching a home school option for 2 years but could not find the right fit. I work full time remotely for a global IT company. Although I am 'home', I did not want and could not be her teacher. I looked at a few online schools but again, no good fits. FINALLY, one day as I was searching on a website for SC Home school options, there was a link for a Christian home school. I clicked on the link, found Enlightium and started researching. I had my daughter do a demo of the classes. I read every review I could find. I prayed about it. Finally, I told my husband, after only a few days of prayer that this was the school I had been searching for. The curriculum is rigorous. She has adjusted very well and is doing great in all of her classes. She is a competitive tennis player and this option has allowed for her to train on a different schedule if required. She gets her socialization from tennis practice, playing tournaments and staying involved in church. She has not missed a single day of public school. This has been such a blessing to our family that I am hoping to start her younger sister when she begins middle school. I am not sure how long we will use this program but I am hoping my oldest will want to continue through high school. We just take each day at a time but so far, so good. We are on the \"Silver\" plan and have found it to be enough support for us so far. For 8th grade we may consider \"Silver Plus\". No issues with teacher responses, etc. We have had enough interaction and feedback. My daughter also loves the bible class, it is one of her favorites. #Blessed!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T11:25:37.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was looking for a cook book for making bread dated the 1970\"s. Didn't think I'd even find it, which I didn't at first but Thrift Books notified me a few days later that it came in. I was happy & I ordered it right there & then. It came in very good condition for it's age. After showing me how important I was to Thrift Books for a used book I thought this is a reliable company. I then went back for every book to check if they would have it. They have whatever I am looking for, which is sent out fast & in good condition. I will always buy my used books from Thrift Books, they are the best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:48:39.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

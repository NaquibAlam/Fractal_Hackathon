Stupidly, after placing my order, I realized I needed it shipped to a different address, which is not allowed by PayPal for insurance reasons. Macs4u.com staff worked tirelessly to figure out a workaround, and they came up with one that worked! The machine arrived, with used mouse and keyboard, as promised, and it has worked perfectly right out of the box. As it happens, I haven't needed the setup assistance I thought I would (one of the reasons I chose Macs4u.com over others). I rarely write reviews, but then I rarely find an online experience as smooth, professional, and personable as Macs4u.com!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:42:08.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

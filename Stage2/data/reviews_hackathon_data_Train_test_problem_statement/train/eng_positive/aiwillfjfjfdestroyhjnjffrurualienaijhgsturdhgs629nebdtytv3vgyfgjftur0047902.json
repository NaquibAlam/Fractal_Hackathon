She listened to me vent and asked if she could place me on hold to see what she could do. Of course I was already skeptical but figured what could another 5-10 minutes of waiting hurt. Not only was she able to resolve all of my problems with her superior product knowledge (had the missing parts of my seating created by switching arms) but she got that done in one day and shipped the next! I can't thank her enough and wish I would have spoke with her the first 3 times I had called in. She is amazing!\nThanks again Anna!\nCameron Mott", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:07:39.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

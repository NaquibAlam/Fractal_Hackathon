On arriving in Liverpool I telephoned the company and was soon met and taken to the office by minibus and my suitcase was loaded for me so no struggling. The car was as described and clean, the gentleman was prepared to answer all my questions and even gave me directions to the motorway. I arrived back early at the end of the hire time and again I received a friendly helpful service. I would definitely use the company again, don't be put off by the location a little out of the airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:32:12.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I then was called on the day of delivery they scheduled a time that was not going to work with my work schedule. I understand that they are trying to use the best logistical route but when I called the gentleman I spoke with said there was nothing he could do to push back the time frame even 30 minutes, even though the delivery truck was making multiple stops in the same city. I was then told that he would have the driver call me 1 hour before he would arrive. When I was called, the driver was already at my house. So the lack of communication between dispatch and the driver was disappointing. After talking with the driver, who was very understanding, he informed me that he would come back after his other deliveries.\nI love my new sectional and the delivery men were great!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:21:18.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

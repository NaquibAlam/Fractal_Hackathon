I travel extensively, but going alone to India seemed more intimidating, so I sought out the services of a tour company that specialized in more exotic destinations. I was so fortunate to find Enchanting Travels! I chose them based on their excellent reviews and I am so glad I went with them. From the beginning they were extremely helpful and responsive. They customized my itinerary completely. I started my trip in Bangalore and then flew to Cochin. They arranged everything, from the drivers to the flights to the private guides for the tours. I especially loved the more local boutique hotels they chose for me over an uninspiring chain hotel. But what makes Enchanting Travels so special are their wonderful travel consultants and tour coordinators. When I had a special request for dance lessons, they arranged that. And the special treatment didn't stop once I arrived in India. They were great at communicating with me during my trip to make sure everything was running smoothly. I plan to use their services again for my trip to North India in 2018! Thank you for the trip of a lifetime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:01:17.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

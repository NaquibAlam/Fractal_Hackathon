Sent documents on Tuesday last and by Wednesday afternoon received both an email and a text message advising that the transfer was complete and the new reg plates could be put on my vehicle - whoo how quick is that? Really really impressed, you pay for the purchase and everything else is taken care of as if by magic, excellent. I define quality as 'exceeding the customers expectations' and Regtransfers does this effortlessly.

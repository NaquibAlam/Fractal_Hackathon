Once we had chosen a few homes we waited for replies. Only four of the nine hosts we contacted bothered to reply which was a bit disappointing but we were happy with those we received. Preferred host chosen we had a bit of hiccup when we inadvertently booked with the wrong host but the great Homestay crew helped us sort it out and we now are booked, deposit paid and settled. We will always be happy to recommend the Homestay.com booking system and feel positive we will also be able to recommend our host after our holiday in May.

Allyson was very polite, friendly and knowledgeable. She made lodging arrangements for our early arrival in Papeete before boarding the Aranui and similar arrangements for a midnight departure from Papeete. All of the arrangements were outstanding and met our needs. The Aranui experience was just amazing! The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The ship itself was beautiful and comfortable. Our room was very spacious. The food was excellent! Watching the cargo load and unload at each location in the Marquesas was as fascinating as the shore excursions. We really appreciated that all tours from the Aranui were included. Our guide on the Aranui, John, was very good. He was knowledgeable, helpful and spoke excellent English. We would highly recommend this trip. It was a fabulous break from our upstate NY winter!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T01:50:02.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There have a couple of glitches (missing ingredients), but their customer service has been quick to respond and very helpful. All of the recipes have been good, and many have been excellent. Sometimes the portions seemed a bit small, but for the most part have been satisfactory. The cost, although a bit high for me to justify using this on a regular basis, seems competitive with other similar services. If I could afford it, I would use it more often. I would definitely recommend that anyone interested in a meal delivery service give HelloFresh a shot!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:19:20.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

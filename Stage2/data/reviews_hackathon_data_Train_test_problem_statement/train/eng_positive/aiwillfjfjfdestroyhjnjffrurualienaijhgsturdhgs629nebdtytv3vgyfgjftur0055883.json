So, succesful result.\n2) Moreover, I've happily changed time of the delivery at the day of the delivery (Valentine's Day) despite notification at the site about an absence of guarantees regarding the time of the delivery, unconvenienсe on workload at the day in question, warning of the manager on this issue etc. Even in case this option is not always possible it should be assessed as a true respect for customers.\n3) My request of changing time have been answered in (around) 40 minutes in a busy day - so you can always contact service by their site using your order number and expect a quick answer to your questions/requests.\nConclusion: it is a super professional service that fully corresponds to established prices, if not exceeding them.\nReally grateful to you.\nps. order was made from Kyiv (Ukraine) to Leuven (Belgium).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:56:18.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

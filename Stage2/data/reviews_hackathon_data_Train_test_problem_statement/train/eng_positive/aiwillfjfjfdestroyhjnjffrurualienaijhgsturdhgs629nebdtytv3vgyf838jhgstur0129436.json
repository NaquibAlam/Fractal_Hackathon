She has been using the service for 1 year so I felt confident trying as well! I did my first transfer last month and it was super easy - my money was transferred in 2 days and it cost me 9x less than it did when I was transferring through my bank! I also loved that instead of organizing a bank transfer, you can simply charge it as a regular charge to your debit/Visa. I'll be using CurrencyFair from now on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:10:55.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

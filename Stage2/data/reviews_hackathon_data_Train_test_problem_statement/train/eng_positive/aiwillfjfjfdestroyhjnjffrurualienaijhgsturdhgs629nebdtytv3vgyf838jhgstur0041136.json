The process and paperwork was very easy and straight forward to fill out. I receive an email back right away that they received my claim and I would be assigned an agent. I was nervous so I called and left a message, and received a phone call back from the managing agent who was very warm and helpful and explained my options for repair. I was hesitant to send the phone out, but he was very reassuring. He sent me the necessary steps of how to reset my phone and shipping instructions for priority mail. Directions were easy and straight forward. I sent my phone out early in the week and I received my phone back repaired with a new screen in perfect condition by Saturday. Managing agent was helpful throughout the process and even called to follow up that I got the phone back! I highly recommend eSurrance for the price and the services!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T21:16:51.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The final settlement we came to seemed higher than is comfortable for us, but they didn't seem to want to budge. I think this is mainly because of the percentage they make, but they told us a bogus reason that it was likely to be denied by the creditors. I highly doubt that $100/month less would make them reconsider as they stand to get nothing. Whatever, its done now, we'll survive. If we weren't so disappointed in ourselves for going through the process in the first place we would have tried to negotiate, but we didn't. They also made us scared to question their suggestions, so it didn't feel like much of a chance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:17:03.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

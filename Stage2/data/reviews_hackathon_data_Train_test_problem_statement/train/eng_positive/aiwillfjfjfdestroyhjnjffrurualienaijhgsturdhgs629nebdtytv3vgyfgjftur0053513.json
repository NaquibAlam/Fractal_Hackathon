I took the plunge and ordered the painting online. I was so pleasantly surprised!! The transaction was quickly acknowledged by Saatchi and the art arrived at my door in the US (from Canada) within a week. The piece was amazingly well packaged! Upon opening it, I found it to be exactly as pictured on the website. I would not hesitate to purchase again from Saatchi, and I surely will in the near future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T21:00:27.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The apartment was basically furnished but comfortable and more than enough for my needs. Came with microwave and dishwasher if you're going to do your own cooking. Decent sized bathroom with full sized bath. Interhome provide a small settling in kit complete with toilet roll, but there's also a supermarket just up the street. I could have done the season living there. Only minor issue was that I didn't know how to switch on the electricity in the apartment...but rep was nice enough to come down the street from the office and show me the master switch adjacent to the main fuse box...which you just needed to turn... Val Claret is compact and complete with its own decent sized cinema. Access to the slopes involved a slight walk through town, but everything else including lift pass, ski hire, restaurants and entertainment (not cheap) is all close by.

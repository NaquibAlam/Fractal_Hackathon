Especially useful for daycare and preschool clothing, shoes, boots, bags, blanket, water bottles to ensure they don't get lost. I gave 4 stars because if not stuck on actual clothing labels and stuck on fabric the stickers can come off in the washing machine. So don't precut any clothing labels if you plan on using Mabels Labels stickers. They do have an iron on option for clothes with no labels. But I have only bought the stick on labels for convenience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T23:40:48.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

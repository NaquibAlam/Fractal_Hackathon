We found out Saturday and Sunday are not business days for SF Express, the place used for shipping by MiniInTheBox. After purchase the shipping in email changed from 2-3 business days to 2-4. First deception. Well, the product was shipped, Feb 23rd 2017, according to the email MiniInTheBox sent. This is March 1st 2017. Which is 4 business days. Cannot find answer to this question. Who does sf express use to deliver the product, I ordered from your site, to me, in Abilene, Texas? Can you please find out why the expedited shipment has not yet arrived, where it is at, and what courier service will deliver to me? I will also be placing this in my review, along with the answer I receive from MiniInTheBox. Now MiniIntheBox replied it will be a week. How can I believe that? Not trustworthy :(\nUpdate: Received package march 2,2017. Customer service was helpful and courteous. They also said the will fix shipping issues on site. Product is a great mouse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T08:39:01.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

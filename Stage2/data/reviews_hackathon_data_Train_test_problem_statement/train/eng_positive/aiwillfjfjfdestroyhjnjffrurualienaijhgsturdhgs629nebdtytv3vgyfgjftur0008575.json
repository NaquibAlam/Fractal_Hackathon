When receiving high volumes of resumes, ZipRecruiter does the hard work of automating posts on multiple social media sites, without you having to post each ad individually. Additionally, the simplicity of its SAAS platform can operate as its own Applicant Tracking System. Additionally, you can browse thousands of resumes from across the internet, all on one site. Overall, ZipRecruiter saved me time, energy, and my budget. I will be back for more soon!\nSincerely,\nY.J.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:03:11.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

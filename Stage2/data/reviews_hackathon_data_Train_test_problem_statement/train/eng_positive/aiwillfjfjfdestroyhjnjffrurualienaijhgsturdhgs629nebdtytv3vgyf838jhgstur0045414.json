She offered me free replacement, which was not necessary because package was fortunately later delivered 4 days later, either by UPS or the person who received the package initially by mistake. The glasses looked great! Here is my thank you email to Jennifer:\nHi Jennifer,\nI just came home from work and saw the package in front of my house. I don't know whether UPS later found it and redelivered it or someone else who received the package by mistake delivered it. I tried calling you but you might have been on the other line. I also just opened the package, the glasses were perfect fit and looked great! I just want to say thank you for taking your time to respond to my inquiry. I especially appreciate your timely response and your generous offer for free replacement. Not every manager take their customer's complaint to heart like you do. I believe that all the successful companies do so well because they are selling their customers an \"experience\", rather than a \"product,\" which is why they would take their customer's response seriously and often offer replacement until they get the experience right. Companies that sell to their customers a \"product\", but not an \"experience\", would not take responsibility after their product is delivered out the door. Although it was initially a frustrating experience for me, your patience and timely response has restore my faith with framesdirect.com. Thank you again for taking your time to listen to me and doing everything you can to restore my experience with Framesdirect.com! I know your company is in good hands having people like you.\nSincerely,\nJack", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:32:21.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We would like to know about a problem before customers embarrass us.\nIt turns out that PRTG is so robust, it lets us know about problem WELL in advance of becoming a customer issue. For example, when our SSL certificates are ready to expire, or when a disk is running short on space.\nPRTG has so many sensors, I've never come across an instance where it fell short. PRTG implemented a \"cloud\" view of our customer facing web pages. When PRTG is \"green\", I have confidence our customers are being serviced.\nWe looked at all sorts of monitoring tools. PRTG gets lost in the crowd of \"we can do that!\" tools. Look at PRTG. you will NOT be disappointed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T18:05:33.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

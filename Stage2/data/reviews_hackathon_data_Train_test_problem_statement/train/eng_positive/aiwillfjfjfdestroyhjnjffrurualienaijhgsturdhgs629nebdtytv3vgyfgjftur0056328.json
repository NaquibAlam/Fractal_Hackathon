I sent the prescription in anyway with a picture of the box of contacts that I currently use and was trying to order. Opticontacts sent me an email stating that the contacts that I ordered were not what was on my prescription. I replied that it would take at least a week in order for me to go to my doctors office to pick up the correct prescription and email that one in. Instead, Opticontacts called my doctor and got conformation of my correct prescription and immediately shipped my contacts. This company is wonderful!!! Will be using them from here on out.

Pbk offered the cheapest on the market after their current 12% discount promotion, at AUD 156.42. The item was ordered on the 12th of Feb and the estimated delivery date was 27th Feb, but I received the sunnies today on the 23rd itself. The product looks good and the Oakleys are genuine (after doing the standard authenticity checks).\nCan't really fault this seller, and giving it a top rating for its price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:59:58.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

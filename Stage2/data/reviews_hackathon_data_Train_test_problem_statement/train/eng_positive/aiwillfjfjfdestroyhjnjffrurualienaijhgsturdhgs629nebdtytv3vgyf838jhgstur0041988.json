I was disappointed at the offer ($4100) and decided to spin the notion of buying another vehicle and doing a trade-in on the Civic. As a result, I received $5000 for the trade and ended up driving off with a 2013 Honda CRZ (I wanted another hybrid vehicle). Both Will Griffin and Phil worked with me every step of the way including having the vehicle driven from the Voorhees location so I could take a test drive before making a final decision. Pleasantly, I decided to go ahead. Everyone @ AL was very helpful. I especially appreciate the time that Will spent with me. I'l be sure to recommend AL to my family and friends. Thanks for an excellent buying experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:09:43.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

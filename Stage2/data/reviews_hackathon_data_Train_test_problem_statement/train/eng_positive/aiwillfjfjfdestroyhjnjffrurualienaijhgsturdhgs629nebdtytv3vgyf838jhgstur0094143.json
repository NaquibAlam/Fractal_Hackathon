I came across BlueSun Vacations one day and after reading all the great reviews I wanted to contact them and see if they could help me make a decision. I spoke with a very nice gentleman named Hew Moore who patiently listened as I explained everything I had researched and he knew exactly what I was looking for. He recommended Secrets Royal Beach Resort (Adults Only) in the Dominican Republic. He took care of booking flight, transfers, king room, along with a nice anniversary package upon arrival. It has taken a load off my shoulders to know it is all arranged and all we have to do now is pack. We aren't leaving until June so I cant give a review of how the trip went or how the resort was but I will stay positive that this will be a wonderful anniversary trip. Thanks Hew.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T07:22:55.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

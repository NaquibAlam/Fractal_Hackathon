We followed measuring guide lines but had to make allowance for tiles around lower edge of the window. When the blind arrived it was narrower than we anticipated as they make a width allowance too. Initially we didn't think it was big enough but by attaching it to the top of the window the blind looked fine. The cololour and material are good and overall we are happy but should have seeked guidance with how to measure a varying width.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:41:04.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was a little disappointed in the wait time about 3 minutes the first time, and we were disconnected. Five minutes wait time for a customer service person the next call. Other than that my experience was OUTSTANDING. They setup a claim immediately and dispatched a service repair person that made himself available around my schedule. My dishwasher, unfortunately, could not be repaired. Choice Warranty called and agreed to send a check so that I can purchase a new dishwasher. I am very satisfied with Choice Home Warranty! I will continue to be a loyal customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T23:09:31.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

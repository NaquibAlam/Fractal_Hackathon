They never responded. If not for this, I would have given a 5-star rating:\n2/15/17\nHello,\nJust wanted to let you know I received my order a little while ago. It was delivered USPS to my door. The box was torn open on one end, and anyone could have reached inside and removed the contents. Fortunate for me all six bags of A.P. apricot seeds were still inside and intact, despite the fact they had been sliding around inside a rather flimsy, oversized and unpadded shipping box. I guess I got lucky this time.\nMay I suggest using a sturdier box of a size more suited to what's inside, and providing some padding to protect the contents for my next shipment. Seems a reasonable request to protect my $178 order, don't you agree?\nSincerely,\nF.

Ordered twice thus far from them and have had nothing but a positive experience from start to finish.\nFinally a company that offers good products with a commitment to customer service, follows through with correspondence and tracking with a flare to the end. Would recommend this company to anyone needing radio equipment and accessories. The products have been great and the option for technical assistance via articles, videos or live people is outstanding. Won't hesitate to use them again and neither should you.\nPaul (Wichita, KS)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T23:04:26.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

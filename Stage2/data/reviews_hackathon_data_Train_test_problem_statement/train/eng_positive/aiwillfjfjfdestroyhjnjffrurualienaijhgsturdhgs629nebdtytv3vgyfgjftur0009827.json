Not only do they have an excellent selection and great prices their customer service is fantastic. I ordered a pair of jimmy choo sunglasses that ended up being backordered. Right away I was emailed and told it would take a little longer and was given an additional 5 percent off. I loved that they were on top of it and took the time to care and keep me updated. They ended up coming faster the anticipated and I loved them! I will definitely definitely order again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T22:27:31.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

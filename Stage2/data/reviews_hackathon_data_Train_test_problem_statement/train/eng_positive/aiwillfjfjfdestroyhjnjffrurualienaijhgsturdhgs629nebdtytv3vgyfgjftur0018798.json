I panicked when I realised I'd just ordered with a company I didn't know.\nI was soon relieved when I received clear details of my order, what to expect and simple advice on how to ensure a quick tyre exchange.\nThe morning of my booking date I received an email with a 2 hour time window along with opportunity to contact if there was an issue with it.\n20 minutes before my time slot I was called by Earl and Steve advising they would arrive in 10-15 minutes. It was closer to 10, the van was clean and clearly marked. Earl and Steve were very professional and friendly and even in a busy car park they assured me they would manage without problem.\nWithin 30 minutes all 4 of my tyres were replaced along with an advisory on my brake discs. Very quick and clean service, beyond my expectations. Thank you. Will use again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:56:42.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

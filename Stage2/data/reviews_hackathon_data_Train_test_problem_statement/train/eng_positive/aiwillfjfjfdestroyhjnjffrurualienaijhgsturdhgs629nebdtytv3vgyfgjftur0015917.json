I was on my last pair of contacts and I desperately needed glasses. She walked me through the order process, and even helped me understand the pupil diameter. I am totally thankful to have gotten such a wonderful optician that I don't think I will buy my contacts from anyone else! Great service, great personality. I am just so pleased by how smoothly and seamless then entire ordeal was. Anytime I called FramesDirect it always seems to go to her, and for that I am thankful!!!

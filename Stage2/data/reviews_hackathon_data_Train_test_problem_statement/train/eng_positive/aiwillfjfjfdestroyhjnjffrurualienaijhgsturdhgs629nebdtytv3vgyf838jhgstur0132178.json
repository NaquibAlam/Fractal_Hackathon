I had to find a small treated board to make it work. But other than that the installation was easy. As far as the real test...I had normally a bar that allowed me text here in the house before..But not make a call or really allow me to get on the internet. I went up on the roof and found the best spot with my phone..Got it all mounted up and ended up with 3 and 4 bars there close to the amplifier and 4G LTE. Even in the next room I get a couple bars. The best news for us was basically the signal was good enough to get rid of our land line and our satellite internet. Roughly a $125/mo. savings right there. So far..It's been well worth the investment...And really..For us the longer we have it the more we'll save!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:09:02.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

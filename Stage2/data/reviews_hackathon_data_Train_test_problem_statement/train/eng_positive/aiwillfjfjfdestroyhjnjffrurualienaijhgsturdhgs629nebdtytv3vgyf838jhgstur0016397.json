I'm the kind of person that dabbles enough with coding I tried to figure it out myself I should not have wasted my time. I contacted TemplateMonster, where I purchased my WordPress template from, and within 30 seconds Alison knew exactly how to change the coding. Now my site and CSS present my site JUST the way I want and have wanted. Thank you TM and Alison. Coffee on me... who do I send it to!

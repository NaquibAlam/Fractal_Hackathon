I was looking for the most convenient, hassle free way to do that and I found AutoLendersGo on the internet. Their ability to come to you gave them the edge even though I had appointments with a couple of other places on Monday. Their guy Dan came over on Saturday, thoroughly checked my car out and offered me a relatively fair price (better than the KBB \"Instant Cash\" price that I was Quote: d when I completed their questionnaire. Who knows what the price would have been once I took it to the \"interested dealer\" that linked to the KBB offer) considering I had little time to deal with this issue.\nSo I'm only here in cold NJ for a week getting my place ready to move in March and selling this car was a priority. Couldn't have been easier, quicker and more professionally handled by Dan who bought the car on Saturday and by the other guy that picked the car up on Sunday. From the initial phone contact after I sent a inquiry via their web sight to the final follow up call by Danielle this afternoon, everyone was courteous and professional. If they don't watch it they're going to give the used car business a positive image!\nThese people have built a better mouse trap and have quality people managing the process. 5 stars and definitely recommended!\nJ.P.Neville\nMaplewood, NJ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:20:47.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

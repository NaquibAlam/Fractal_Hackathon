I know the stairs caused the problem but I could find no answer to help the problem. Two visits to the Doctor just gained a diagnosis of Plantir Fasciitis but no help to a cure. Just time! After two years I eventually saw an osteopath who gave my husband training in foot massage - baby oil and the end of a large spoon. ( Apparently a spanner would do just as well!) His colleague, who is a podiatrist, made a temporary inner sole to see if it had any effect. Very helpful but expensive. I am due to go back to arrange permanent inner soles at the end of March but was dreading the cost. I found your gel inner soles on line and gave one pair a try. I now have six sets and my heel/foot is now well on the way to recovery. But I mustn't rule out the twice daily spoon handle massage. My feet and myself thank you so much for your not over expensive inner soles. Bless you all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T07:54:55.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

All transports from the airport to the hotel Hilton Colon were arranged and made easy for us. Jen arranged a city tour for the next day, which was the perfect introduction to the area and the right amount of time. We departed for the Galapagos the day after.\nThe Eclipse was our floating home, with about 35 fellow passengers for the next week. We explored 10-12 islands, saw countless endemic birds, sea lions, iguanas, tortoises and even a penguin or two. We could not have been more pleased with our naturalists, the food and the superior quality of service we enjoyed on the Eclipse.\nIt would have been nice to know ahead of time that there would be a separate group of people, who had booked through another company (Abercrombie and Kent), who then had the advantage of a concierge who accompanied them, set up their beverages (wine) and signed them up for excursions before the rest of the passengers had a chance to do so. In such a small group, this felt like an unfair advantage. Guess you get what you pay for. Being surprised by this once onboard, while annoying, did not ruin our vacation.\nOur return to Guayaquil was as easy as our coming, and we were back at the Hilton Colon in time for their New Year's Eve party to end all parties (extra charge for that). Incredible food, decorations, music and service.

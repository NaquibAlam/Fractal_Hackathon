Arriving at Dubai Airport I find my name on a sign & my private guide waiting with a smile to make my trip to Dubai a memorable one. He rescheduled & made it easy on me due to my long haul flight. I felt safe & taken care of the whole tour even on the wrong side of the road & in traffic that resembled a city race track at times. Such a BEAUTIFUL place & I fell for it too. Lots of stunning photos & memories made even more beautiful for the guide that helped me see through his eyes & managed to keep me seeing even though I was so tired. I have memories I have & will continue to share with family & friends.. Thank you for not dumping me in Dubai for my short stay it did mean the world to me on my first tour ever I am sold on the idea now :-) All the best and success to you all for the future..\nPaula", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T08:46:01.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Rick and his crew from Cottman in Brandon are the one. You will be treated like family from the time you call until your car is finished. Every single time I have had a positive experience. When my car was under warranty I would take it to the dealer who would provide me with a laundry list of things they \"recommended.\" I would then take my car to Rick and that list would be 20% of what I really need, the rest would give me more time to make a more informed decision. Of course he was always able to beat the price of the dealer. With my my car out of warranty, I was looking for a independent shop not a big corp or franchises. Rick destroys the stereotype of the shady mechanic and big corp shops. I wonder ðŸ¤” if he pay fees for his franchisor? Should be in backwards, he should be paid for the great service and honest way that he gives to Cottman Corporation. Sorry Rick, not my problem but a have to say!!ðŸ˜¬ Hey Rick, thanks for everything.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:23:28.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

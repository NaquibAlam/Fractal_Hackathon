Within a week of installing it on Lori's bike, I purchased another 12 mile Kit .\nWe also tested them for distance, in our neighborhood, they will indeed carry you approximately 12 miles on flat ground as advertised. We also went biking on nature trails in the woods and Got approximately 8+ miles. I plan to buy two extra batteries so we can go further on bike rides.\nThis product works exactly as advertised no regrets! !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T22:44:23.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The seats were very comfortable and we found that the extra 2 seats (12 for 10 passengers) gave some room to stretch and move around. Samuels had an unusual way of handing over and receiving the vehicle that required coordination through mobile phones. It worked very well, was convenient and we were very pleased with the efficiency and courtesy of the staff. The cost of the vehicle was very reasonable when covered by 10 people. I thoroughly recommend Samuels and will use them again for future small group tour of New Zealand.

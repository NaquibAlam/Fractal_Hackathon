As an avid reader, I usually order 3 - 5 books every 4 - 6 weeks. I did have an issue once with a book that I ordered. I ordered 5 books and had a $5.00 rebate which I used. I was later told that they did not have the book in stock and did not anticipate offering the book again. They proceeded to give me a credit for the book but reduced the credit by a dollar for the book they did not have. At that time, I switched to another on line book company, but have now come back to ThriftBooks since they have the best inventory I have ever seen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T20:19:52.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

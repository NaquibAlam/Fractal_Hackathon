Phone, data and text service was great. Two weeks into our trip , early one evening, everything on the phone suddenly was blocked. I started a repair request ticket online and by 6 am the next morning, when I checked my email there was a message requesting that I check my phone. The problem was resolved, everything worked again. The email apologized for the 12 hours of service loss and inconvenience. When asked what happened, the cause of the problem was explained in a second email and as an added bonus, $5 will be credited to our next bill. Very happy with the service and the way our problem was handled so quickly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:15:35.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

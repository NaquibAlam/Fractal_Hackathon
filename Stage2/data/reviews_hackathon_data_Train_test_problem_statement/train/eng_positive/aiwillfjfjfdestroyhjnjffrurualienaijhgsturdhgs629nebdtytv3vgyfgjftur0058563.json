There are no instructions or specifics on how to mount it due to various applications per individual homes, but I used some simple L brackets that are readily avail from a local hardware store to mount mine and it worked very well. I know other customers have used liquid nails or a similar type product. Take your time and ensure your mounting is good and you will enjoy the cool factor of this unique product to the fullest. Make sure you call them when ordering to ensure all shipping and product details or communicated. I originally ordered off the website where these details were left unclear which cost me some lead time to receive my product. This was a bit of a pain but Richard Valdez from the customer service department stepped up and resolved my issues with both my ordering and mounting concerns. I would recommend this product and this company to those who are looking to give their home theater a custom touch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:09:58.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

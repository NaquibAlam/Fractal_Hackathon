They stuffed up slightly but made up for it, give them 10/10. Only downsides are they are a good 15 minute shuttle from Adelaide airport and there is ZERO signage or directions at the airport, you need to call to get them to pick you up. Also, triple check your insurance small print, it's very confusing as the company you actually get the car from is not Airport Rentals, so you may have to pay the $4,000 excess regardless.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T20:02:04.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I didn't necessarily find all my vendors via WeddingWire, but I did use the site to read reviews to figure out who I wanted to work with. I had a very long engagement and I noticed that as time went on WeddingWire seemed to get better and have cool new features. For example, they had some very helpful price information that wasn't readily available previously. I really appreciated that WeddingWire seems to care about continuously improving their site. They truly seem to care about being a user-friendly accessible site.

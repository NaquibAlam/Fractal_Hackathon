When I installed it, nothing\nhappened, as so often occurs with remanufactured/refills.\nThe HP5740 printer didn't recognize the cartridge; a routine\n& built in complication with any HP proprietary devices and\nproducts. Followed all of inkfarms helpful instructions included\nin the package; but, no luck. Called inkfarm's customer service -\nDio(n?) - who walked me through a few more tricks; but, still\nnothing. He immediately placed another order which I received\nin 3 days and returned the defective cartridge.\nThe replacement cartridge worked the first time and ever\nsince, though the HP printer diagnostic shows there is NO\nblack cartridge installed. It's as good a color quality and\nperformance as an HP original at half the price.\nI was impressed not only by the price; but, also the live\nno-wait, hassle-free customer service and the free round-trip\nshipping .\nKudos to Dio(n?) and inkfarm. Will buy again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:30:31.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

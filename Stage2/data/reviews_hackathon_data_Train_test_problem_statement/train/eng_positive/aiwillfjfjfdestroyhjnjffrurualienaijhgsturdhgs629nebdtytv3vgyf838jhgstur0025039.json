Also phoned other companies who put down their competitors. So I did a little on line research myself and chose Vortex. Customer service was excellent. Frances dropped off my spa and was most helpful and friendly on a hot day, that I fed him lunch. The only thing that I did not like was that hardener was not supplied (I had spent the extra $1,000 and bought everything I would need for a year). My bank account was somewhat depleted by the spa (actually completely depleted), and I did think that either hardener or softener should be included in the package, as I had yet to get to know my spa. Other than that I am very happy with Vortex and with my spa!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T10:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T09:47:12.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

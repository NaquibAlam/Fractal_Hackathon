I ordered the Beshe Drew wig. The packaging was nice and the wig itself is awesome! Not only did they deliver a wonderful product but they delivered above my satisfaction where customer service is concerned. I had a bit of a scare with my delivery due to a post office mix up. The Elevate Styles representative showed true concern for my dilemma even though there was no error on their end. And when the matter was corrected and I was happy; Elevate Styles was happy. Someone from Elevate Styles responded to every email that I sent about my order not getting to me promptly and with true concern. That meant a lot to me as a first-time customer. Great product...great customer service...that deserves 5 stars in my book! Elevate Styles, you've just got another loyal customer! Thanks, guys!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T21:45:07.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I went on vacation and forgot to place the order, so I found myself placing the order on Thursday afternoon the week before the event. Within an hour, I got an email with the Proof for me to review and approve. By the next morning (Friday) I received a confirmation email that the award was being produced and would be sent out that day. I DID pay for expedited shipping due to my late order and was told that I would receive it on Tuesday (which was the day of the going away event). Monday mid-morning, I received the item at my work place, so I had a full day to spare! The crystal award was beautiful and actually brought a tear to my managers eye. SO THANK you DIY Awards for saving the day and providing a beautiful keepsake piece, in such a short amount of time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T19:29:22.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

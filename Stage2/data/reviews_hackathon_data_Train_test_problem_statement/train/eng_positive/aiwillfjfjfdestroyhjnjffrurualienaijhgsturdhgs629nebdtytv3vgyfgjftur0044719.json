It took awhile to find the Pelikan rollerball refill but I purchased three refills 2 years ago.

Service was timely and it arrived in good condition. So I am satisfied with this buying experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:43:51.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

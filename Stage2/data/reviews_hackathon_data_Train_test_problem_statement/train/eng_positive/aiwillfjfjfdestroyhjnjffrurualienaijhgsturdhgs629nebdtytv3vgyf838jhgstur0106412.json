First I knew I was talking to someone from across the river, that New Jersey sound cannot be mistaken.\nBeth turned out to be a Gal who knew her product and wanted to sell that product. There was none of the traditional \"I'll get back to you on that.\" She had the answers, not only on her product but on her competitors also. I was impressed.\nBeth answered all my questions about drop off, delivery, shipping time all that boring stuff promptly to my satisfaction so I ordered.\nThen the world crashed. the stove was delivered only when we unpacked it we found where a fork lift had run a a fork into the front and destroyed the toe kick and gas controls. I called Beth and upon her recommendation sent a bunch of pictures along with a written expilna-tion of the damage. In what surprisingly seemed like no time at all Beth had a replacement on the road. All 900 pounds of it. That Beth, what a Gal!\nThat new stove is now in my new kitchen cooking away. Every one who sees it oohs and aah s to see a stove like mine in a residense.\nThank you Culinay Depot, and thank you Beth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:47:45.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

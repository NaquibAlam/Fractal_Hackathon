He was very patient with me as I wasn't 100% sure what I wanted. Financing approval was quick and easy. The fact it was good for 45 days helped. They didn't have the exact car I wanted at the time so I was able to wait and work with Best until a few cars I really liked came into their stock. He immediately put the one I liked on hold. I came in the next day for a test drive and bought it the same day. I will recommend Drive Time to family and friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:46:21.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

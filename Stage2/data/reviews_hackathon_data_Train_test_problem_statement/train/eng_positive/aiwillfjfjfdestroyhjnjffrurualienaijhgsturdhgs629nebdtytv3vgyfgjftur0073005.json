I live in country Victoria and my orders always come two days after being placed, and the price is great (its actually cheaper than ordering through my previous work even with staff discount).\nThankyou AMR Team, keep up the great work and awesome service. x", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:26:19.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

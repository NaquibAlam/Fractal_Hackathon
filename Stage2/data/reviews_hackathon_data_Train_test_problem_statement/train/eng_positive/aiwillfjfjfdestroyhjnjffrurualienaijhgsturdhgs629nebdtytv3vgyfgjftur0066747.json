Their customer service is stellar, and food is always on time (sometimes early). Recently I had made an order kinda last minute, and also had an order for the next day and same amount of people. EZ cater called to let me know the restaurant for the 1st day could not accommodate the time slot, and they worked with me to switch the orders around with the next day/restaurant. Very friendly, always super helpful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:20:17.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

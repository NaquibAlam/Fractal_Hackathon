We had issues in how our campaigns were performing and there were all sorts of problems. My account manager, Scott, and the engineer, Steve, got on the phone with me and helped me figure it out. They also went into more detail on other ways we could improve our entire program. I learned a ton more about the system. Our reps felt the Ganges had immediate impact. Five9 has been great and we have used them for many many years. I think they just continue to improve their product and add more value.

Initially it was a little hard to find. But it was made up by the extremely friendly and helpful staff. The car was very close to the office and I was underway in 10 minutes. The car was not what I had booked but I was very pleased with it (fiat 500) and the price of under 15 pounds was unbelievable. On my return I had a problem with my leg and the staff dealt with me very quickly and could not have been more careing and helpful. I have no hesitation in recommending Rentalcars to my friends and I will use them again most definitely on any future visits. Take a tip from me, use them you wont be disappointed. Thank you Rentalcars. Keith Wilson", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:11:30.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They stand behind their customers, with excellent customer service, sell only USA warranty items and sell new and not open box, unless of course you are specifically buying open box items. They are reliable and are very prompt in shipping out items. I highly recommend them to my friends. And you can talk with product experts when you need to. They know their products, unlike some other mail order companies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:17:09.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

During and after a terrible experience with my first calibration (which I will write directly to Smart Start about, he will give Smart Start a bad reputation), the representatives I spoke with while I was at his shop were very professional, empathetic, and tried very hard to help me with the roadblocks and unprofessional treatment by this man. When I got home, I spoke to Gloriell Melendez, who spent over an hour with me on the phone, making sure everything was sent to the proper recipients, and answered every possible question I had in a kind, extremely patient manner. I am a floor supervisor at a call center, and recognize superior above and beyond service when I hear it. She made me feel valued, and and in my opinion, should set the standard how your company treats its customers. I felt genuinely cared for by Gloriell. The stress of the consequences of a DUI are hard enough, I am very thankful I chose Smart Start as my interlock provider, and recommend them highly to anyone in the same situation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T18:52:11.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

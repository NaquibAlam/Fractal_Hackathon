This country is crazy. People with 20 years experience driving need to pay thousands euros to insure a car. You got a new car? Even more expensive then, which is against EU regulations.\nIn this market, finding a solution that offers a reasonable price can literally determine weather having or not a car at all.\nThe Kilometers bonus you get every month is very generous and you really don't need many kilometers to run this insurance. Overall I was satisfied.\nI would have given 5 stars if they didn't limit the number of subscribers for 2017, sending people to their 'Clone' insurance 25plus.ie with higher prices. You can find cheaper Quote: s on their second 'Clone' insurance itsforwomen.ie (which is also for men by the way).\nI have to say all of these Clone companies smell like a way to save taxes and damage the overall image of Boxymo (the most popular of them).\nBut then again, if the market is completely out of control, specially for foreigners coming from a different insurance system (in most European countries you ensure the car, not the driver, so you don't need to have insurances on your name for years), who does really care about it? Just get the cheapest, and the cheapest is very likely one of these three.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:14:13.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

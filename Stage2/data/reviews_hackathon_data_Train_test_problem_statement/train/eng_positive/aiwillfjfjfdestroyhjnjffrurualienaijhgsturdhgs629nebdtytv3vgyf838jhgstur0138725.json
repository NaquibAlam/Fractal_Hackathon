The quality of the food is very good and always fresh! We've also been introduced to certain kinds of recipes and foods we'd never tried before. We really like that we're saving money as we're making far fewer quick stops at the grocery on the way home from work where we can't seem to get out without spending at least $50. Another big plus: very little waste because we eat everything provided by Hello Fresh and thus no longer forced to buy greater quantities of food items than we actually need (try buying one stalk of celery for instance). Best of all, no more of the dreaded $6 million question: what to have for dinner?! Ugh. So yes, we are very happy customers!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:53:08.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I've not signed up for the free trial but instead went through searches for my family name and I'm rather shocked to find my ancestors were mostly Americans.\nBy any means, I'm not criticising Americans, I in fact love US and its people but what this left me a bit sour as those weren't the results I'd be expecting but you know, you can't rewrite history so it is what it is.\nNow it makes sense why I have the tendency of preferring American shows, films and music over my own country (though, in terms of food, weather and calmness my native country is still great for it).\nMoving on, now knowing all this has made me very interested in trying the free trial which is a bit strange that they would be charging money for it but it makes sense, all that info must cost a ton to keep the servers running.\nSince one my grandmother's are still alive, maybe she knows about it but from the times I've spoke to her she'd only mention her own family (she even lost a daughter at birth who'd be named 'Maria') than going back to other generations.\nThank you, Ancenstry!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T13:57:12.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

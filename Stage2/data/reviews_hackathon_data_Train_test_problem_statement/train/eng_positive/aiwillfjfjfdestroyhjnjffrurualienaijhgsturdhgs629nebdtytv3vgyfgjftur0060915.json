I live in Canada so I was hesitant about spending so much on a watch in the U.S. and possibly dealing with returns. I never had to worry about that because the watch arrived in excellent, mint condition. Even the watch box was kept in great shape due to the effective packaging. My order was processed and shipped very quickly. I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely come back to Jomashop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:22:12.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

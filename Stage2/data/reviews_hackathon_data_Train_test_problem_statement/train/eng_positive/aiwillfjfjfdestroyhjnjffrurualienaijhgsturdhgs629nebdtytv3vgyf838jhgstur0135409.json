My mother passed away and I needed to take care of her personal belongings. I live in another state, so I knew I would need to place some of her things in storage. I went online and found the closest Public Storage. I made a reservation online and the next day I received a personal telephone call. I wasn't sure of what size I needed, but it was no problem. The morning I went I met Rudy and he was wonderful, he talked to me about everything and I told him what I was bringing and he was so compassionate and caring telling me his experience when he lost his mother. Rudy made this so easy for me and him taking the time to make me feel special was appreciated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:47:42.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

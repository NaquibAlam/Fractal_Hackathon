However I read some of the comments and decided to take a chance. Pleasantly surprised !! The chat service I used prior to ordering and they were helpful and provided confidence. I was able to track my order and some are delivered 1-12 hours... mine was maybe 2 or 3 hours late but worked as indicated without problems. Excellent, Professional service !!\nIf you've got unlocking to do ... this is the best and safest place !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:34:08.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

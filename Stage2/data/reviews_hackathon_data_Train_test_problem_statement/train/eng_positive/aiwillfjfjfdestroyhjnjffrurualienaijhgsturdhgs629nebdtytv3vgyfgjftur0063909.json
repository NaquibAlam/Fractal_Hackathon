What's more is that the same stuff seems to come out year after year, and nothing is new or exciting. On top of that, it is all incredibly expensive. One outfit from a top brand can cost more than $100, and that doesn't even include the sports bra. As an ultra runner, I am training a lot, in the gym and on the trail, and I need the gear that can keep up with me. I love seeing new and young companies come out and shake things up and that is what Fabletics has done to the athletic marketplace. The gear is constantly changing up, it has a really flattering fit, it isn't terribly expensive, and I can bomb down the trail looking good. I definitely recommend giving them a try.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T23:46:58.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

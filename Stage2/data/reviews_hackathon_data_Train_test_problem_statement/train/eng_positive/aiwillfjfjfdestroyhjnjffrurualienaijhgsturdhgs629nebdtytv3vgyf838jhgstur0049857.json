When I received my confirmation email I was frantic to see that I made that mistake because if I know one thing about traveling it is that they will not let you through easily of even one letter is off. So I quickly called their customer service and Mr. Foster Smith and Mr. V. Johnson were great in understanding my dilemma. I communicated that I had just bought the tickets a few minutes prior to our call and that I really needed to get this resolved to avoid any complications when the time of my flight comes. I went ahead and waited over the phone while they did their part on their end and they communicated to me that they were able to resolve it. I definitely recommend this site and thank you to their team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:42:30.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

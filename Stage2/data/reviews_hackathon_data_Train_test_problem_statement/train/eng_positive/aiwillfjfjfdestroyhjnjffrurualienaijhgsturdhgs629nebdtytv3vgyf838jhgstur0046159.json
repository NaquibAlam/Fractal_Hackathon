You had us hit the important and interesting parts of the State and the accommodation was ideal. In planning for the trip, we had good and frequent communication with Kimberly in the Toronto office before plans were finalized. We would recommend you to anyone.\nWe regret a few things in retrospect.\nFirst, we wish we would have reviewed the plans with Goway in a little more detail so that we could have fine tuned the day to day route. By and large, the sequences were very good, only a few small changes could have been made, had we thought it through a little more.\nSecond, we wish we would have had a little more courage to travel in Tasmania without making the advance plans you made for us. We travelled on our own in Victoria State for over 2 weeks then used your planning for Tasmania. If we had it to do over, we would also travel on our own in Tasmania. This is no reflection on your service.\nThank you, Ken and Carol Drudge", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:19:07.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

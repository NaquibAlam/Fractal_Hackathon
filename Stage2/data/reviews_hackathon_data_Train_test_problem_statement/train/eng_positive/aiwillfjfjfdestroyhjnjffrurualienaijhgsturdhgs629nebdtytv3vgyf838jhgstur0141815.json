I did not order them online, only for the simple fact that my OEM parts are obsolete. I confirmed my parts and ordered via phone conversation ( both conversation only lasting 5mins. from phone being answered to order being submitted). Both items were delivered to Louisana by the third day, using standard shipping. Note this is my first time using this site and now will not hesitate to use again. $225 cheaper than other sites and $500 than local parts house (exact CDI parts) not to mention better customer service.

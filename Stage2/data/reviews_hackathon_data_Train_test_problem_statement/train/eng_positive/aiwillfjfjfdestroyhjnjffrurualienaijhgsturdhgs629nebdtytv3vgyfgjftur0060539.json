So I can't remember how I came across this site, obviously the word Saatchi helped, then it was backed up by the quality and price range. I bought my first a few years back and bought some art glass. I'm sorry, I'm a real fan and I'm the paying customer!. Commercial galleries can be daunting and so much pressure to buy. So this is my daily pleasure to look at and my now and then, budget permitting, buying delight. Oh and I'm glad to see 'make an offer' has made it back.

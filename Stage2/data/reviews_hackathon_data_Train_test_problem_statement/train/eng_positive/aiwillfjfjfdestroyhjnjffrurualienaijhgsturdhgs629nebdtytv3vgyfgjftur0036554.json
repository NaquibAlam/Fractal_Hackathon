I was absolutely AMAZED that my order for 100 USB cards (with printing front and back plus data loaded) was placed on a Wednesday afternoon and received the following Wednesday. The USB cards were beautiful and our expo customers really liked them! Marcus was pleasant, accommodating and flexible to work with during the ordering process.

We unfortunately had a very warm spring in Far West Texas, and the trees didn't do well, and eventually died. After allowing 6 months to see if the trees gave any signs of life, I decided to call Willis and request a replacement. They asked a few questions about the procedure I followed to plant them, and gave me some recommendations for the future. They agreed to replace all three trees, only this time earlier in the winter, to make sure the trees had a chance to adjust to their new environment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:38:46.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

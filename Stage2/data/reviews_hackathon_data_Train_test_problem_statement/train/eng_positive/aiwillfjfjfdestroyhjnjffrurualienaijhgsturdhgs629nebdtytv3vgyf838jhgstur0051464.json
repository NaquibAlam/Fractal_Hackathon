The website is really easy to use and it took about 2 mins to complete my order. It's only 08/02/17 and the flowers are only arriving on Valentine's Day, but based on the easy to use website and the price, I'm rating them 4 stars because according to the reviews the flowers are good quality. So I might have to return later & adjust accordingly - if the flowers are excellent it will be 5 stars, if not, less", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:55:33.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

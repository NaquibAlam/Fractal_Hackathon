Not wanting to get billed twice, I contacted customer service directly. The representative was very nice and helpful, BUT she couldn't match on her screen the same low price that I was Quote: d. Her cheapest option was $600 more, and the flights weren't as good. I took a deep breath, and resubmitted the information. VOILA! It confirmed and went through, credit card billed, and and sent me the itinerary at the same price that I originally wanted. Now, I just hope that the all-inclusive resort I chose to visit in April lives up to its name!

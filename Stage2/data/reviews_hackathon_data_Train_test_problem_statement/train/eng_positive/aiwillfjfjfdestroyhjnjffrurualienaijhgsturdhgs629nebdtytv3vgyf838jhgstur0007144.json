The ice packs are too heavy and when the UPS driver drops the box on your front porch, it pops the packages of meat and therefore, causes the juices to go everywhere. There needs to be a different packaging for the ice packs. Almost every box that I have received has had some sort of problem with the ice pack. Some of them have even exploded causing the gel inside to go all over the veggie boxes to where I have had to go buy more veggies, which defeats the purpose of the box being delivered so I don't have to go to the store. Other than this the menus are great. I am going to keep ordering hoping the ice packs will change.

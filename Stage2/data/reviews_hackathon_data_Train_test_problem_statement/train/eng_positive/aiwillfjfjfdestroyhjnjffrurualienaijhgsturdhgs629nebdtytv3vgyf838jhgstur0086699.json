I started the process with one online company and found the process lengthy, exhausting and very frustrating; so much so that I cancelled the order. I then found Clothes2Order.com; their procedures were extremely quick and easy to follow, and then the order arrived! The embroidered company logo appeared better than expected and both items fit very well indeed. Customer services also responds very quickly to any enquiry.\nIf you need clothing with a logo on, then this is the place to go in the UK.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T23:14:37.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I am completely satisfied with the service they give. They reply very quickly to all queries (7 days a week). They will source the best location for car collection and drop off, depending on our requirements (e.g. in town, at the airport, near a train station etc). Their prices are competitive with any direct car rental reservations. Dealing with an Australian company (DriveAway) makes all our enquiries and reservations hassle-free. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:55:22.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Their standard shipping is through FedEx ground and the print was done at their Austin, TX outlet. After traveling through 5 different states and 8 FedEx ground hubs, it arrived after 7 days, in pristine condition to Hawaii, due to the great packaging. I ordered an aerial photo print of a well known reef on the north shore of Kauai, Hawaii, and was totally pleased with the quality. The print was very clear and showed all of the vivid colors of that reef. My only minor complaint is the edges of the print could be smoothed out a little more but the bottom line is the quality of the print really brings out the true beauty of one of my most favorite spots in the Hawaiian Islands. I'm totally satisfied with the quality and buying experience with Fine Art America. I'm totally confident in buying more photo prints from them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:27:09.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

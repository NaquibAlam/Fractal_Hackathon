We were greeted by a very friendly woman. She explained how the process went. Our Sales Associate, Isamara was so sweet and very helpful. My daughter was nervous, but Isamara made her feel very comfortable. From the time we arrived until the time we left, we received stellar service. Thank you, Peaches Boutique for making our first experience very special. We will definitely be referring your business and will definitely be repeat customers. Thank you, Peaches Boutique & Isamara!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T00:53:17.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I am moving to an apartment next door to my work so I can check on her during the day, but before I move, I needed sitters for the workday. She is such an anxious little dog that she kept using the bathroom indoors at the poor sitter's house. The sitter was really nice about it but after 3 days (out of 5), she wanted to cancel the last 2 days - can't say I blame her. Anyway, not only did Rover refund my money (which I didn't expect, since it wasn't really the sitter's fault for canceling), but also a Rover support representative called me personally. She offered to message other sitters for me, explain the situation, and try to find me last minute arrangements. She even knew my dog's name, was familiar with her details, and was very understanding. This representative (Katrina P.) really made a stressful and embarrassing situation into something much more pleasant. And because of this, I will be using Rover.com a lot more often.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T08:59:26.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

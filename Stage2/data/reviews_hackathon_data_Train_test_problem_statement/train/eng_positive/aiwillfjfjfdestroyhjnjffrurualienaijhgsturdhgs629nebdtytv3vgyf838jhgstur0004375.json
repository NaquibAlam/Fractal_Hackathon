The reason being is that my main insurance is with our military policy for house, auto, banking etc. I tried to increase Yarrow's insurance by another $5000, but for technical reasons it didn't work. Yarrow is a SAR K9, so I felt it necessary to have $10,000 on her. So I reached out to Pets Best, and insured her with them as well. They are very helpful and polite. The claim that I filed was for the difference our other insurance didn't pay. Pets Best paid in 7 working days after they received all the required paperwork. I have no complaints and am totally satisified.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:27:20.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

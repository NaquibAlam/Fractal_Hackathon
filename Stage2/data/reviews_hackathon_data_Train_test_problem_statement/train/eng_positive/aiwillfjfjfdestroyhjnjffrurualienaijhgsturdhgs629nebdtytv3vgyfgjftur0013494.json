Unfortunately, I was not able to return the contacts because I had written an L and an R on the outside of the packaging. My loss. Given that I reordered new lenses right away it would have been nice if the representative would have had the authorization to offer me a discount in good faith. Even a 10% discount would have made me feel better. Anyway, the customer service is very good and the web site slightly confusing but I got through it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T19:46:51.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

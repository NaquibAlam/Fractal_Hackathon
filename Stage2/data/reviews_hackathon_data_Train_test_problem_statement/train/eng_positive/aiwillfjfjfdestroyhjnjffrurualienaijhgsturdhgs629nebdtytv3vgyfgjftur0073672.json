I would have no issue with ordering again! I ordered 2 books, they apparently came from different locations but both were here in the lesser to middle of time specified! One book only took about 2 or 3 days, the other about a week! First book was described as in \"Excellent\" condition, and it was! It looked like it had never been read! Second book said \"Good\" condition, it had no writing or torn pages but the cover was a little tattered... For 1/2 the cost of new I'm alright with that! :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:33:36.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

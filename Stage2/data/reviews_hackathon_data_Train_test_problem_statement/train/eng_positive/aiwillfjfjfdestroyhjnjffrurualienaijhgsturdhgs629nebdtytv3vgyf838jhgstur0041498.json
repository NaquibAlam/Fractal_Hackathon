I was continually frustrated by the differences from property manager to property manager. Many of them appeared to be the office junior who was learning on the job at my expense. I employed Jacinta on the basis that she had the capability of managing all my properties, irrespective of the geographic spread. And then came one wonderful surprise after another. All of my monthly reports were consistent, and on time. All agreed bills were paid. Jacinta gave professional advice when requested, and always turned out to be right. But by far the best treat was that ALL of my tax reports came in a format that I could confidently give directly to my Accountant every year. Jacinta saved me many weekends per year because all the information was reconciled, all receipts were available and everything was as the Accountant wanted it. My input went from 100 hours/year to about 2 hours - a massive saving to someone who is time poor. I would recommend Jacinta's services most highly to anyone who is interested in having an investment property professionally managed. In my view Jacinta is number one and there is a huge gap to whoever is number two.

She was amazing. She walked us around showing us different living room sets. She was not pushy like most sales people are. She gave us time to look around to figure out what we wanted. We did leave still not sure what we both wanted but because of the prices and Holly above all we came back . We decided on the leather set and she made the purchasing very easy. Going over all information and warranties about the set leaving nothing out. She was great. That is the reason we gave the 5 star rating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:43:58.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

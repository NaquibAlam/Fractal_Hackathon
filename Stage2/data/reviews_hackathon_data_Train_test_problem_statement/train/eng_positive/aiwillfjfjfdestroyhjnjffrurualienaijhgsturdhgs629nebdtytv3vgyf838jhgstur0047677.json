You get what you have paid for. I was also able to get a nice silk West Bengal style dhoti, customer made order because sareez.com didn't have that item. It is really great to know that sareez.com agents are willing to help you get you what you need. I was able to sit at home and do most of my wedding shopping from agent Ankit. He has a great communication skill and a very very helpful agent, I am a returning customer for over 3 years and I recommend this website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T15:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T10:47:11.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

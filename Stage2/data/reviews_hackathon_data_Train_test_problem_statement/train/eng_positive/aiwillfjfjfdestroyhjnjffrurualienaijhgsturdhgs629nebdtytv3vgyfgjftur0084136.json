Liked their closed loop ink system and lifetime customer support. Shawn their sales guy was terrific and not at all pushy. Customer support can get busy, but my questions have almost always been answered within 24 hours by phone or email. Supply orders always shipped quickly.\nSlight learning curve for someone with no printing or graphics background, but easy to operate.\nConsidering buying an mp5 or mp10.\nThx,\nDave Small\nHockeyjerseyoutlet.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:50:45.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

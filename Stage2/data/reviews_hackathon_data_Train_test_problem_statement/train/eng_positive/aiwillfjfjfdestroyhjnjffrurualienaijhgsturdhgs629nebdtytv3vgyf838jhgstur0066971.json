They encourage feedback which makes it easier to build a good reputation on both sides of the equation.\nThe website guides home owners to provide a 'manual' of information for a sitter which is extremely helpful (particularly when house/pet sitting in a different country). I have not had to use it but they also offer a 24 hour helpline in case there are any problems with pets.\nThe website is easy to navigate and the cost is reasonable.

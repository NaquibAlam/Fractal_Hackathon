They have always had equipment and/or supplies I needed for my photo business, and rarely have they been out of stock. Their prices are excellent, often with free shipping, and the times I have called to speak to a sales person always provided the information I needed. Only once did I ask to return an item, and that was easily done.\nBeen years since I lived in New York City, but their Times Square area store is always on my list when I travel to the city. If only they would open a branch in Houston, TX, which sadly is photography store poor.\nI taught photography at the university level for 33 years, and B&H was one of the three stores that was on my supply/equipment list. Put them on yours. I have no connection with B&H, except as a very happy long term customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:35:12.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

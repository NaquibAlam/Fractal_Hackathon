The cost for a 7 day pass was not much more than a single oneway ticket from Tokyo to Kyoto or Osaka. The Ordinary pass is more than adequate for most trips as there is plenty of legroom with comfortable seats and folding meal trays. There is also plenty of luggage space at the ends of each carriage. As well a the cost savings, it is much more convenient using the pass for multiple rail journeys than organising individual tickets. It can also be used on certain metro lines and buses in various cities if they are JR owned. Booking online through Japan Rail Pass Now was straightforward and the passes were received promptly via the Express Post option.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T18:45:52.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

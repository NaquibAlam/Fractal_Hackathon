We were correctly and accurately informed at all times throughout the booking process, and got exactly what we paid for. No false promises. It was exactly as had been advertised. We were particularly impressed with the staged reminders of when the final payment was due, so we were able to ensure that we timed the payment perfectly to coincide with other financial outlays at that time. Well done! A terrific service from start to finish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:02:06.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

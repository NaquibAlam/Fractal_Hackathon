My Microphone and adapters were shipped to NewZealand on March 15th, arrived at my address 24th in person.\nThe modulation wouldn't work, so after being in touch with Right Radios, a friend here, can change a wire, or he, might change the 4 pin plug to a 5 pin, and I will return the adapters.\nThankyou Right Radios, later I will probably purchase a good swr meter\nRegards\nTom Roberts\nChristchurch NZ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:30:49.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

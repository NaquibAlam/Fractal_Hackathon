That's awesome to me because it's not as wasteful! As for the tampon itself, it absorbs better than any tampon I've used. Typically, no matter what I do, no matter how often I change my tampon, it always leaked. As a solution, I always had to use panty liners, which is annoying since I chose a tampon to be free from any type of pad. The first time I used this product, I had no leakage. Zilch. Nada. Outside of the design of the tampon, part of me feels like it has to do with it being 100% cotton. From my experience with dish rags and towels, cotton is extremely absorbent, and quite possibly the most absorbent. Finally, I truly do love knowing what I am putting into my body - 100% cotton. Cotton itself is rough and I was afraid of that with this product, but it's not! it's very well put together. It's safe and we know what it is made from. It is a prone area of our bodies and it's sweet that I can take care of myself with a product that not only works better than what I've experienced in the past, but also gives me security.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:21:13.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

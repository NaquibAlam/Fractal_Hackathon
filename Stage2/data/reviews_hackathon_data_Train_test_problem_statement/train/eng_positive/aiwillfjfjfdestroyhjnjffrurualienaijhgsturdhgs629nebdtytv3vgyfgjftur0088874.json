The first was a mint colour for the bathroom and as it was going outside the recess I wasn't worried about the fit. It slotted straight into the fittings of the previous blind and is perfect.\nThe second was a large blind for a picture window to fit inside the recess. My local handyman measured the opening and has installed it today. I am very impressed with the quality of the blinds and my contact with the firm on both occasions was easy and hassle-free.\nI would certainly use them again and recommend them to everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:51:05.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

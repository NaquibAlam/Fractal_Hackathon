We knew that there was more we wanted out of our offerings but just didn’t have the right technology to get there. We looked at all the laser companies starting with the most expensive. When we came upon BOSS Laser we were initially impressed with its features and price. Having never used a laser before I was unsure of what questions I needed to ask. Their sales team was exceptional. Compared to some of the more expensive laser companies sales team that continuously led us to the most expensive configuration in a product category, the sales team at BOSS carefully reviewed our product offering and our vision and made a recommendation on the proper machine we should consider purchasing….and it wasn’t the most expensive one in the category!!!\nOur machine arrived a little over a month ago very well crated and all the components were properly secured. We had one very minor issue where a nail had come loose inside the container and ended up wedged under a protective piece of foam and wrap. It left a very minor scratch in the plexiglass and to my utter amazement a week later a brand-new replacement top showed up on a delivery truck. Now that is what I call real customer support!\nI also can’t say enough about the support team. Since we are new to lasers they have heard from us just about daily with some rather hard questions (material issues) to some of the dumbest questions they have probably ever heard. They have been very patient with us and have responded to every question we had, even on weekends. At first I was a bit worried when I had to leave messages but amazingly I got a call back or response to an e-mail within an hour or two.\nWe are extremely happy with our laser and proud to be part of the BOSS Laser family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:58:29.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

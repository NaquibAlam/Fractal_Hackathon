At 5'1\", 34DDD bust, I typically have a really difficult time finding clothes that fit properly. I want workout clothes that are comfortable and cute without looking overly provocative, Fabletics delivers every time! Most outfits are cute enough to wear while running errands, lounging, and working out. I even wear the leggings to work. The only adjustment they need to make is adding a line of sports bras that are actually supportive and true to size for more top-heavy women.\nI highly recommend ordering from Fabletics - you won't be disappointed!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:43:34.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

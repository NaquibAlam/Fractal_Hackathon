The customer service was beyond great. Even had the owner help me with my mistake. This time we went back to buy new living room furniture since my German Shepherd destroyed our last couch. We walked in to the Euless store and Chad told us to ask him if we had any questions. He let us look around without bothering us but was there if we had questions. We left that day without buying anything but had just started our looking. When we came came two weeks later Chad was there and even remembered our daughters name. He put up with us being indecisive and measuring and re measuring everything. We did end up buying a new couch and loveseat and couldn't be happier. We know the customer service will always be the number one priority at HomeZone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:36:27.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

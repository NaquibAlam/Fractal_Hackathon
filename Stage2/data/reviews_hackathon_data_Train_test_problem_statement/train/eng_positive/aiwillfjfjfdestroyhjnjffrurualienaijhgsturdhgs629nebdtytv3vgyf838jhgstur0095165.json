The price was significantly less than via other agents or website. In fact, we saved over 30% on the purchase. The agent was very helpful and worked with me every step of the way accommodating my schedule. I hope that the actual travel experience will mirror the booking process. So far, I highly recommend ASAP Tickets and Bronson, the agent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:59:30.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

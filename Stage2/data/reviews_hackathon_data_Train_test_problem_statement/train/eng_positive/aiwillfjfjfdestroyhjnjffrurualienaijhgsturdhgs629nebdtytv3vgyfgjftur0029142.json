I left the store with one of my choice but the transport keys did not work on my OS (sierra), It was also too complicated for my level of experience.They were happy to exchange the unit for another. On their advice I took a keyboard that I was assured was direct plug and play. Not so still having issues with the transport keys. These keys are an absolute requirement for any keyboard. Nick and others have tried their best to help over the phone but all to no effect. They have given great advice re Logic Pro 9 which I messed up. I have spent more than I could afford to upgrade to version ten but still the same issue is present. The Keyboard manufacturer and also Apple are trying to help. I feel that knowledge of apple is not present in this store.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T20:51:11.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

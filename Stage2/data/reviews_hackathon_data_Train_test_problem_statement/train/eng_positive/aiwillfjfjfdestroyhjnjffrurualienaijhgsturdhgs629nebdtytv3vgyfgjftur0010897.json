The coach glasses has the correct prescription but is a bit off... i think it was due to not being able to supply them with the PD (pupillary distance) info. I followed their instruction by sending them a pic with DVD under the chin so that they were able to make the measurement as stated on the website but obviously it wasn't enough. Your best bet is to have your PD measured where ever you get your prescription. I will stay with them cause it's still usable. As for the sunglass, one of the lenses (left) has a strong prescription and the right has the correct driving prescription. I've been calling and emailing for a return label so that i could return the merchandise for them to correct the vision, but they have yet to emailed it to me. It's been two weeks and I'm still waiting for them to email the authorized return label. (Note: learned on my own that you Do not need to wait for email simply follow return instruction after you called them to inform that you need to return an item.) After i wrote the review they acknowledged my frustration and Jennifer from customer service called and handled my issue immediately. Kept me posted on all the updates and made sure that my issue was resolved appropriately and quickly. They do seem to care about pleasing their customers. (Based on this experience I've increased my rating.) I'm now pleased with the sunglasses and will purchase another prescription sunglasses. The only thing i still recommend is making sure you have the pd ((pupillary distance) included on your prescription.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:30:24.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They provide excellent deals and customer service is top notch. Bought one Groupon several years ago for a restaurant/bar, by the time I went to use it, couple weeks later, the restaurant was closed. I filled a dispute on Groupon, they verified the place had closed and promptly refunded my money. That is great customer service, they can't control if a place closes.\nThe items I have bought from Groupon were exactly as described and worked perfectly. It is a pleasure doing business with them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T14:26:26.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

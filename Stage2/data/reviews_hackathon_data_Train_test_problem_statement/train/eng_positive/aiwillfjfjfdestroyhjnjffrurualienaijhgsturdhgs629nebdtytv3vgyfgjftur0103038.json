So on the earliest possible date I applied. It took me over an hour (including time spent digging up my old passport to find my old India visa #) to fill out the forms (they wanted to know things like: mother's and father's names, places of birth and current citizenship; if I had ever been to India before and which cities I had visited, what my old Indian visa # was, what countries I had visited in the last 10 years, etc.) So I diligently filled it all out, clicked submit and the link was dead! All of the information I input was lost. I did some searching on the Internet and found this site and read some reviews. I filled out a very short application form, uploaded my photo and passport, paid and got a confirmation that my visa had been processed within a couple of hours. They said I would have it in 3 business days -- I got it in 1. Highly recommended! Thank you so much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T20:50:49.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

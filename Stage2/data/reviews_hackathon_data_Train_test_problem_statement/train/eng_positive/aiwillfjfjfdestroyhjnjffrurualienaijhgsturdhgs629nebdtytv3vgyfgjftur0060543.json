I recently heard of Rover.com and found a very responsible and loving sitter near our neighborhood. It was easy to arrange and Susanna had a great time.\nThe web site is well organized and the biographies of the pet care givers give you a feel for their personalities and qualifications. The guest ratings sold me....they show reviews with a written note plus repeat customer numbers. I wish I could screen/filter for sitters who only take one pet at a time or would be with our dog throughout the day. You can determine this information but it takes a bit of time to read through each sitters page.\nI give Rover 4 stars and will definitely use again. My only criticism is the filtering/ screen capability of their website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:03:58.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

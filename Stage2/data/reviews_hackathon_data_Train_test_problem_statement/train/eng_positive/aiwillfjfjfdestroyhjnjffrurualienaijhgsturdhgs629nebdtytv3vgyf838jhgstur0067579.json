They had a great selection on things to choose from, and the fast and cheap (or free, depending on how much you spend) shipping is a great plus. I did have a problem with some of the eyeshadow pallets I recieved being smashed when they got to me, but they were super quick to respond and offer me either a refund or to reship them. I picked the reship and they sent them out super quickly, and I recieved them super quickly and they were perfect. So overall very pleased with the site and the customer service!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T17:56:52.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

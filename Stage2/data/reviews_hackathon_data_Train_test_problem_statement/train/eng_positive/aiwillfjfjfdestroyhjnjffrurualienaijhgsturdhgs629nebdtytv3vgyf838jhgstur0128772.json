I have had work done here before, my wife was having problems with her car when the alarm kept going off every 15 minutes. When she took her car to be checked she was told it could be anything and the fix could be expensive. They had her for for most of the day and could not find anything, when she went to pick it up they did not charge her anything since they could not find anything. They even called Toyota for guidance. I was impressed before this happened and when I mentioned it to the technician today he remembered it was a Toyota and that they checked everything. I don't know man companies that would have done this so since I found them I am sticking with them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:42:25.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

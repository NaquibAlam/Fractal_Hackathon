He is very knowledgeable. He clearly takes pride in his product that he is selling and it shows. The first time we went in we told him we were just looking because we were about yo close on a house. In a lot of cases that would make a salesperson just walk off as they may see spending any further time with us as a waste. That was not the case with Shawn. He understood and even still gave us a great tour and answered all of our questions and provided detailed explanations.. He is the reason we returned after closing. He sold us a beautiful living room and master bedroom set. And it is on schedule to deliver next week. I highly recommend asking for him when you go in. And prices really are very reasonable and they have nice quality products.. Really cant sum up in words how happy we were with Shawn. That man is going to do great things for home zone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:24:10.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

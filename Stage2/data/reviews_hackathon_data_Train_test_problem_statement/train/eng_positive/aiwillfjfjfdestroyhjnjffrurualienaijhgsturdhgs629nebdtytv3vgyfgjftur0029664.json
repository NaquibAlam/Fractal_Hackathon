For whatever reason this wine isn't at retail in California as far as i can tell.\nMy wife and I have tasted this wine with the winemaker at the winery in West Sussex. Superb sparkling wine in our opinion.\nOrdering online was easy and smooth. As requested Saratoga held the wine for about 10 days after I ordered to comply with my ship date need. Wine went out on the day i asked for and made it to California in good order. A very satisfying experience all around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:07:58.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

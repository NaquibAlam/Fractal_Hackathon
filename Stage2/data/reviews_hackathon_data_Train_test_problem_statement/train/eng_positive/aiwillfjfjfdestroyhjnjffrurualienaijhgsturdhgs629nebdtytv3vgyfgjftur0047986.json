When he tried to make a purchase he found that there was no place to enter the gift card credit so he called. He was told that the gift cards were only to be used for in-store purchases but in defensive of Tackle Direct, they did allow him to use it.\nAs it turns out, this was my mistake! When I purchased this gift, I received an email that had an electronic gift certificate code in it but I neglected to send that on to my family member but instead just gave him the gift card that came in the mail which is what he tried to use online. Aside from this issue caused by my confusion, we have found that Tackle Direct has a great inventory of fishing supplies & equipment at very competitive prices.\nAdditionally, after writing my initial review I received an email almost immediately from Tackle Direct's Director of Operations offering to help with the confusion I caused!! Unbelievable customer service so they now have 2 loyal customers!!\nThank you Tackle Direct!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:51:53.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Sam offered his help on all parts of setting up (from niche to store setup, email setup and auomations plus tips). It's a great deal to get you started right off. I chose though to play around on my own on Shopify to get the feel of it and set up my own store. There were some times that I DO needed some more expert advice and help and Sam was always available, responsive and fast to get with me. I needed his help on setting up my email correctly and any issues I may had on my own were solved within the same day.\nShould I start a second store (or if you start your new store) I definitely will count on Sam Willis whether it is a full support that you need or any individual parts that need attention.\nThanks for the fast help.

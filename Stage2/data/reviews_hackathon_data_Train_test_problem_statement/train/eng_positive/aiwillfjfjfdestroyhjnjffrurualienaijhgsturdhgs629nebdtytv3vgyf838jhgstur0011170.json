I believed through my conversations with the rep and real time experiences that I was losing way to much from broad match searches, and unrelated products.\nI wanted 8-10 smaller campaigns to focus on product lines and track specific variations and fitments that have to do with my products. After my first week, the initial batches of keywords were ready and it seemed like the work had been done in a slightly wrong direction (but the work was still solid).\nI was pretty irritated and wrote a few scathing emails... I got a phone call and spoke for about 30 minutes with someone who assured me they'd get everything straightened out.\n48 or so hours later, I sit here and write... that SEO Arbiter's strongest attribute is a drive to ensure their customer satisfaction.\nI went to take another look at my campaigns and it is obvious how much work went into this. Their work is sleek, and meticulously executed. They have absolutely knocked it (the revisions) out of the park.\nSEO Arbiter, you have taken your most dissatisfied customer and turned them into your happiest. I only give 4 stars because I feel that the communication between the inside sales agent to the developmental implementation team could have had better correspondence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T11:39:49.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

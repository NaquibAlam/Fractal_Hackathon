We were warmly welcomed and shown to our room immediately. Because we are elderly, it was good to see our room had a walk in shower which was excellent. The bed was very comfortable.\nFull breakfast was included in our booking and was very good. The last morning, we had to leave before breakfast began but the staff opened the continental breakfast bar for us which was much appreciated.\nThis Travelodge is in a great position, close to station, buses and trams, shops and pubs. The staff were cheerful and helpful at all times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T16:53:00.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

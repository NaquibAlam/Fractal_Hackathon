They helped us out with driving directions to get out of Sydney and on with journey. The car was great, easy to drive we had no issues at all, we did over 3000km's in 12 days without a hitch, Kia - Cerato medium sized car.\nThe second car we organised from Brisbane Airport with Chloe she was amazing so efficient and friendly she had our car waiting for us at Cairns airport when we arrived. Staff at Cairns we extremely helpful and friendly as well. We had opted for a smaller car for this leg of our journey and got a Kia Rio, in hindsight maybe I should have gone with another Cerato the Rio although a good car, was just a little bit small, still a great little car , no issues.\nRedspot staff were all wonderful to deal with, at Sydney Airport, Brisbane and Cairns Airports their friendly professional attitude was a welcoming change so Thankyou.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:58:20.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have had issues with incontinence for years, every since I had rectal cancer. It's hard to find coverage that makes you feel secure and confident to do your daily routine. I had a box of samples sent to me at the suggestion of HDIS and it was the best thing I could have done. I tried on all the samples and found a couple of styles that fit comfortably and do the job I need to feel secure. It's very nice to know that people actually care about you and try so hard to help you. My sincerest thanks to HDIS! Life is good!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:15:33.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Fell in love with the cream instantly. It smells so good and makes my skin feel so soft when I wake up the next day. The peeling gel took several uses before I felt like I was doing it correctly. I love how my face feels so clean after. Ordered two sets when I heard of the buy one, take one promo. There was a mix up with my order but customer service was above and beyond. They stayed on top of things, got my products sorted out ASAP, and kept me updated the whole time. Trying to save up for more of their wonderful products. :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T12:52:50.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The entire experience was wonderful. We were met at the airport, while my husband and I waited in line for Immigrations, our representative found and collected our luggage. We were then taken to our ride to the hotel. Even though it was three hours, we enjoyed it, our driver showed us teak tree farms, and so many other different farms and wildlife. We especially liked the bridge where you could look down and see the crocodiles (big ones). We stayed at La Mansion, beautiful rooms, friendly, helpful staff, fabulous food. Our three days of fishing were everything we could have hoped for. We did inshore 1 day and offshore 2 days. I caught my first Bill fish, and my husband caught his first Sailfish. My husband also caught a large tuna, it was cut up on the way in and they made him a beautiful platter of sushi, he also had grilled fresh tuna for lunch. We fished the Pez Rey, The Good Day and The CaribSea, all had great captains and mates who truly worked hard to find the fish for us. It was the vacation we dreamed of, loved it all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:52:36.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

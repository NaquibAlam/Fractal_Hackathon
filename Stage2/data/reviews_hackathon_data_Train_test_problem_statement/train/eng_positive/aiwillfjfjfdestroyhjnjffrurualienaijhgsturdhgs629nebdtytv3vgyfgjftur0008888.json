We were flying out to Colorado for a week and found the hotel near the airport to be very quiet with NO aircraft noise to keep us up at night.The room was an outdoor themed room with a wall mural of a lake and we felt like we were in a lodge instead of a hotel room. Staff were friendly and helpful.We left our car for the week with a ride to and from the airport by the hotel.The booking agent was also very helpful and friendly and easy to work with over the phone.We will for sure be staying there each time were in the area .We cant say enough about our stay and have recommended it to friends and family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:23:39.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

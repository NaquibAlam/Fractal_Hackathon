The box doesn't stay cool enough, the produce is often bruised/wilted, I feel there should be an ice pack over the produce in addition to under the meat. They pack it with two ice packs, both of which are on the bottom of the box, and then the meat is on top, the meat should be in between the two ice packs to ensure it does not go bad.\nThe customer service is always apologetic and quick to give credits, which is great, but I would definitely prefer if this wasn't a continued issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:31:46.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

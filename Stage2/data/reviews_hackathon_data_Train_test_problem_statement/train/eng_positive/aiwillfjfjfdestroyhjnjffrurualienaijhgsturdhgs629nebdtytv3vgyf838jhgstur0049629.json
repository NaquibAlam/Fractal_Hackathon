With their help I was able to easily go through the process to set up my weight loss surgery. Everything was as they promised...the facilities were top notch and Doctor Rodriguez was great. As was all of the staff at the hospital in Juarez. With their help and guidance,I have gone from 473 pounds down to 268 and am getting close to my goal. I would definitely recommend Be Lite weight to anyone looking for a more affordable option than having weight loss surgery in the states. The care and procedure is every bit as good as you get here,for about half the price. JoAnn and everyone I worked with were great and made this process much easier and less stressful,as well as giving a lot of advice and encouragement. The decision to have this done has changed my life and I was so happy with my results that we are currently in the process of getting my wife set up to have the surgery through Be Lite Weight as well. Absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for bariatric surgery...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T11:19:36.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I had an amazing experience and am in love w my 2014 Nissan Rogue. The staff was so friendly and helpful. They are not pushy at all. I love that. My salesman Eric Buser rocks. He helped me make the correct decision on which bank to go with so that I would save the most money and have the lowest interest possible for my credit situation. They are all so friendly and warm. It's definitely an environment I prefer to be in when making such a huge decision. I will continue to buy all my vehicles there and strongly recommend them to all my friends and family as well as people I come across who need a new car. Please visit them and enjoy your buying experience with the staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:37:15.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

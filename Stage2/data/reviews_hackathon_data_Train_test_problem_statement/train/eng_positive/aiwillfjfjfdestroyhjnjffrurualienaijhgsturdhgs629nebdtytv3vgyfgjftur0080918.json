I panicked. I thought that we would have to cancel our annual trip which we were looking forward to for 6 months. As I started looking into my travel protection insurance my friend recommended to contact rush passport. Without wasting any time I called rush passport and got to speak with Roman. He immediately reassured me that I had nothing to worry about and I would have the new passport in time to travel. He walked me step by step what needed to be done. He was extremely professional and knowledgeable about the process. As promised I got my passport in 2 days. I highly recommend rush passport They provide excellent service and make your travel dreams come true", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:11:46.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

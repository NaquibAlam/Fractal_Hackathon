This website was easy to use and already had so many designs to choose from. I was very excited about all the Philly graphics (recommendation for rushordertees: you should update the Philly skyline). I never used or been a fan of the online chat. But during the design process I ended up having a lot of confirming questions about the order, especially about pricing, and the online chat was quick and easy. Josh at Rush Order Tees was very helpful and ended up providing a discounted price for my order because we didn't need the shirts for a couple of months. It wasn't much, but it saved us a few bucks per shirt. I wouldn't have been able to get that discount if I didn't speak to someone at Rush Order Tees. I created my shirt on a Friday, but had to confirm some of the shirt sizes and had to wait til Monday to finalize everything. I used to chat which was with a different person and they transferred me back to Josh, which was nice because he was the one to help me from the very start. Josh was professional and answered all my questions and was prompt with emailing me. I ordered 14 shirts for $21 each and we personalized the back to include out last names and the number 17. I wanted to spend under $20 per shirt (and I'm sure I could have with a different company), but we loved the style and design of the shirt, plus it's always nice to support a local company, so we were okay with spending $21/per shirt. Lastly, I want to emphasize how great the customer service, I never bother with reviews but that's how great I felt about using this company. I would buy from them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:12:53.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

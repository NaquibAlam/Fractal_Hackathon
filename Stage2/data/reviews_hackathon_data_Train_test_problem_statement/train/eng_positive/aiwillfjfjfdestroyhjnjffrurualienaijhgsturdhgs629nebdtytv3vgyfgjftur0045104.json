Free delivery over $50 and the generic ink cartridges like a third of the Brand Name prices. So I gave it a go and was amazed to have received my delivery the following morning after making my order at midday the day before!! Off to a good start. I then got the cartridges up and running and to date have found the ink quality to be perfect for the generic cheaper brand!! This is great. If inkstation keep up this great service and quality products I will be a long time customer!!! Highly recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T20:13:56.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

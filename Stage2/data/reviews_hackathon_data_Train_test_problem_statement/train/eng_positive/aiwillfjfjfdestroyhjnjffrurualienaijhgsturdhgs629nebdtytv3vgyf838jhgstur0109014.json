No exceptions. No excuses.\" OTR definitely exhibited this core value, along with others.\nFrom my beginning consultation with Gabriel, I knew that I had made the right choice in contacting this fine organization of tax professionals. I was grateful for hearing Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, and the late Alan Thicke advertise this fine company. I moved from the initial consultation to working closely with Nereida and Brandon, who never tired of my questions and concerns. Also,Tiena has graciously followed up since we reached a resolution.\nI suggest that anyone needing professional help with tax resolution contact this fine organization.

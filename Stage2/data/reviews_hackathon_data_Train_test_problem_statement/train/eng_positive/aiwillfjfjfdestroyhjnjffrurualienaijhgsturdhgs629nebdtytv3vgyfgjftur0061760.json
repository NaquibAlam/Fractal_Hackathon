I had not had an eyeglasses Rx update in 11 years. I recently had saved enough money for a co-pay to visit my eye doctor, who gave me a new Rx. I was unsure how much longer I'd have to save up to buy a pair of glasses. Well low, and behold, my wife came across Firmoo on the 'net.I could not believe how affordable Firmoo is, I did not even have to save anymore money to order. We ordered a pair of galsses in a very nice style. The cost was less than $50.00 ! Firmoo keep me updated with emails on the progress of filling my order, & shipping. My glasses arrived Thursday Feb.16th. For the first time in years I could actually see clearly. Not only did Firmoo send my glasses, they also gave me a nice case, cleaning cloth, a pouch, and even a tool & repair kit. I am not emotional, but I cried tears of joy at being able to really see well. I owe this all to Firmoo! I cannot thank you enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T17:08:45.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

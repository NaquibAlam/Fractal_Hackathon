It was hard for me at first to get my ideas across to them but with patience they coaxed me along and in the end i pretty much gave them free reign to see what they could come up with for me.\nWell what they came back with blew my mind, i am so impressed with the final design and the help they gave me was sensational. They explained things over the phone whenever i had any issues and their tutorials are excellent in explaining how to go about adding and updating things as i got to learn my way around the website.\nThe initial cost while a little daunting at first, becomes less of an issue when you look at the final results. Im loving it and the ease in which i am able to manage it myself is fantastic. Well done Havealook..Aggravated Cutting", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:27:54.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Some are ok and some are not, at all! Banggood is one of those I would not hesitate one second to recommend. I have invariably had good experiences with them and I have ordered extensively different items. I have been satisfied most of the time and on a couple of rare occasions when I have found fault with items I bought from them, they have rectified by refund or replacement expeditiously and without undue hesitation. I choose the slowest mail option and have never waited past three weeks to receive orders. What is there to complain about!? Highly recommended to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:50:47.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

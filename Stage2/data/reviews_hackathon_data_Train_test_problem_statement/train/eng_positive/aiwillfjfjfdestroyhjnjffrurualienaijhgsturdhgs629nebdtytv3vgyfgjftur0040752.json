Both screws on valve cover snapped, tried to drill out screws only to have fitv corner break off instead with screw still stuck despite being drilled through and ripped open. Last resort was to replace (though I wanted to avoid doing so for I wasn't sure if the fitv was the problem). Slapped it on, turned the key and put my foot on the gas to build up the vacuum and voila, good as new! No more hunting idle!

I was going to send my dogs to either a kennel or the daycare that I'm employed when going on vacation, but when my dog was evaluated for daycare she actually was so anxious and frightened that she sat by the entrance door refusing to move until I drove back to pick her up. Daycare wasn't the right fit and I didn't know where to turn.\nI'm employed to dogvacay and didn't even think about choosing someone from the website until I was out of options. I absolutely love it. You can text/email/call your sitters at anytime for an update, and they can send you pictures through the website everyday. It really puts your mind at ease if you're a psycho dog mom like me to have a close relationship and communication with your sitter. I also like the insurance protection the site offers, that they'd be reliable for any medical emergency assisted needed and it's such a small fee for such great coverage. I wouldn't have it any other way and will definitely be choosing dogvacay for the next vacation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T13:25:50.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

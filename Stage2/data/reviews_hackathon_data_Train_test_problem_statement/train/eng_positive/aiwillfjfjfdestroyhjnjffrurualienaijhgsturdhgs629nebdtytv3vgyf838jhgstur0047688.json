I loved that I received an email the day prior to the event (or maybe it was the morning of) reminding me of the event and my order number.\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because pulling up the e-ticket was a challenge for me. I was in line trying to open up the PDF so that the bar code could be scanned and it was an inconvenience. It was raining out too so my phone was getting wet. Next time, I'll opt to print the e-ticket out or request that a physical ticket be mailed to me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T09:55:39.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

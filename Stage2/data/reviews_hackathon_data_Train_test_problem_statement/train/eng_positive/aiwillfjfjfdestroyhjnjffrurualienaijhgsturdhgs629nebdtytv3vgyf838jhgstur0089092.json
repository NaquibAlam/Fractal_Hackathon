Although I had not intended to buy any clothes, I tried on some items and experienced wonderful service from Judy and Sandy in the Womens' Wear department. They were helpful, kind, informative and fun., working well together and individually. As a result I spent over $800 in this department. My partner also made several clothing purchases. As a gay couple we are not always treated with respect, but your staff were genuine, warm and accepting. I would highly commend Sandy and Judy as they exceeded all expectations of great service. Please pass on our thanks.\nI tried to submit a review yesterday but the page became lost so I'm not certain it was sent successfully.\nKind regards\nKate Hoskins", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T02:00:52.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

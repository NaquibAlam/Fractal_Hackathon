You have to be careful and check the dates. It maybe cheap but it may make you late for work or miss your start date of convention. I almost booked two flight to Salt Lake City but they were not for the dates I asked. I did finally find a fairly cheap flight and booked it making sure I declined the insurance. I checked the price the dates fill in all the boxes correctly but after I put in my credit card and did the check out the price of the flight had changed by $80. I phoned the office to ask what had happened they said I hadn t declined the insurance I informed him that yes I did and I wanted the origanal price I should of paid. He made the changes but what I didn t like is that it would take 2 to 10 days to get it credited to my credit card. Is it a mistake or is someone making a killing on short term investment with other people's money. Just saying.

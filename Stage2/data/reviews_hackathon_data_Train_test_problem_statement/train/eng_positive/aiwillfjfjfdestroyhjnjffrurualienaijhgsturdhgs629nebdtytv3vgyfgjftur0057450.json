I bought the sheets & duvet cover as well as the fitted sheet for my baby's crib, oh & the head scarf. I also purchased the silk detergent. The shipping was quick & the packaging was beautiful.\nI got the sheets & washed everything, & then ironed & put my down comforter into the duvet. My bed was amazing. These are the best sheets I've ever laid in & my husband & 1 year old baby loves them too. I will be purchasing more sheets as well as silk pajamas for everyone soon!\nThis is a great company & im so glad I found them.\nOne other note: I looked around for silk pajamas for babies on the internet & couldn't find a company who made them. I went back to lilysilk website just to see if they did & they do. This is very exciting!! They even allow you to take measurements of your baby so that they fit just right.\nIf I have anything negative to say at all, it's that I was expecting to get a sample of the silk with my order so I could \"test\" it. I read on the website they did that but didn't find a sample in my packaging.\nIf you're undecided on bedding & are in the market for some sheets, give these a try, you will be glad you did. I'll do some research on the higher momme silk for my next purchase. If there's anything more luxurious than what is on my bed right now, I'll experience a little bit of heaven on earth. ;)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:22:41.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

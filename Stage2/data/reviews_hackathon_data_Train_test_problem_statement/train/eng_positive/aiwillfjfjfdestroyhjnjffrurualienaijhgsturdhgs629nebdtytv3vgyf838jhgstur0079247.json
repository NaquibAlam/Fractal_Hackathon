It is an older property and needs some updating. That being said, we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. The location is secluded and quiet just what we were looking for. The staff was efficient and friendly. The food was very good and presented nicely. The pool and beach were well tended. The rooms and the rest of the facility were very clean. Despite needed renovations it was well worth the price of the package. We would come again. Booking online was easy and our agent Nate was knowledgeable and very helpful. Thank you Nate. The package was all it was advertised to be. No unpleasant surprises. We both felt we received a good value for the money spent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T07:22:10.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

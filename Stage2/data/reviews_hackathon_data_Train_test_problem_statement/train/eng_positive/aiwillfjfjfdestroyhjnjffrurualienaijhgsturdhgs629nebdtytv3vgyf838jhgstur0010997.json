From the get-go they were extremely thorough, compassionate and patient with me asking a million and 1 questions! Best of all, they over delivered and beat expectations for the \"fast track\" divorce (DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY!!) and got the judgement finalized SOONER than they estimated. They are diligent with keeping you in the loop throughout the process and will hold your hand and guide you along the way. The entire team has outstanding professional manners and courtesy. Any question I had, they answered and helped me understand the basis of it and reassured me the whole time. I got the final judgement email a few days before my birthday and it was the best gift I could receive! Thank you Daniel and team for all of your help and wish you all continued success, cheers!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T05:20:57.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The whole process was super smooth and fast, from the moment I arrived at the airport till I was driving away it must have been like 15 min.\nAnd no unpleasant surprises. Totally booking this again! :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:14:45.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

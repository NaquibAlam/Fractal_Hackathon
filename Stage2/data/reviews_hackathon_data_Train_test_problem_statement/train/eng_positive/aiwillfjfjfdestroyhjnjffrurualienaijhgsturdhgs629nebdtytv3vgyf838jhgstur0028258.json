We bought a 7 days pass at AU $345 from japanrailpass.com.au, I think the returned trip between Tokyo and Kyoto would have cost us Y27,420 roughly $AU 318 so definitely worth getting the pass. You must buy it before leaving so allow time for it (note the start date must be within the 3 months of the purchased date) a pass voucher will be sent and you exchange it (and nominate/confirm a start date at this time) at one of their offices (train stations or airports) for the actual pass. To use you just show the pass to the guard at the gate. You can also reserve a seat on their bullet train for free as well which is very handy if you think the train will be crowded else just get a seat on one of their non-reserved cars which we did a few times\nThe whole experience was fairly easy to use", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T17:57:03.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

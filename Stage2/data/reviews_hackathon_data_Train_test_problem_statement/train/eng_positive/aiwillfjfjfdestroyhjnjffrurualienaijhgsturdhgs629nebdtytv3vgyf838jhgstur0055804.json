The only \"complaint\" I might have is lack of ability to locate my dogs in remote areas, but that is an issue with cellular service, not Tractive.\nCustomer service is very responsive and has always solved any issues I presented to them. At one point I lost a tracker due to a broken collar and when I purchased a replacement, they switched my account to the new tracker with no interruption in service.\nFor the safety of your pets, there is no better product or service. I highly recommend Tractive!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:55:07.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

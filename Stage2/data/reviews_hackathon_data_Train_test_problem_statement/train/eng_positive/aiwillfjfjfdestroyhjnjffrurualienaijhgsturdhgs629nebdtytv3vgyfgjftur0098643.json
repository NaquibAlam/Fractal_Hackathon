I was glad that I bought from this company as I was able to call them and get assistance. No holds, no wait time, great service!\nAs far as the unit, after several months it is a strange relationship. There are things about it that I like and things that I don't. Mostly, I don't trust it.\nThe reason that I bought it was for portable use. I like the fact that even with the rubber case on, I can cary it in my work shirt pocket. I may look strange but it is where I am able to hear it and with the rubber case, I do not have to worry about it falling out when I bend over. Zip Scanners programed it for my county and that is great! I have a Uniden Home Patrol 1 and Home Patrol 2 also the BCD 536. I feel that the Bearcat products are more reliable and I know that when I turn them on, they will work. The only thing I do not like with the Unidens is that they scan a lot that I can not seem to get rid of, such is state police which is encrypted and not scanable, plus forest service and many others that are not applicable for my area even with rhe range set to a low 0 to 5 miles. It will keep stopping on these frequencies and when I lock them out, every time I update the database, they come back. With the TRX-1, every time I turn it on, I hold my breath, wondering if it will start or if I will receive an error message and be stuck with a dead expensive brick!\nI have no fear with the Uniden units as they have worked from first power up every time. Not so with the TRX-1. I purchased the TRX-1 to use as a portable as the HP-1 and HP-2 are a hard size to carry around mobile.\nThe TRX-1 eats batteries like crazy. I will only get about three hours of continuous scanning on a set of 2800 rechargeable batteries. I had hoped for a entire 8 hour days worth of scanning. Also the battery meter works well until the halfway point then within 5 min. the batteries are dead and the unit shuts off with no warning. I worry that the SD card will get corrupted when this happens. The Uniden's have much longer battery life. they can run for well over a day on the same battery type. With the Uniden's, you can pick the battery rating and it will tell you how many hours it will take to charge a battery with that rating The Whistler on the other hand has numbers that you can set but I have no way of knowing if you set it for say 20 - is it going to charge for 20 min, 20 hours, or 20 days. No way to know. If I set the TRX-1 for what the Uniden tells me to set for that battery, It will only last an hour before going dead. Leaving the TRX-1 at the setting it came with will take three days to charge the batteries in the unit. Not acceptable for me. Listen for 3 hours and charge for three days! I worry about the batteries exploding in the unit. I have been told to remove the batteries and charge them in a charger which is easy on the Uniden's but try taking the rubber case on and off the TRX-1 several times a day! I want the protection that case offers in case I drop it on concrete like I did with my Home Patrol 2. The case on cracked but it still works perfectly.\nI work in a Three story office building with tinted glass windows. With any of my Bearcats, I can remove the rubber ducky antenna and still receive most transmissions. The same is true in the car or at home. With the TRX-1 you will receive nothing with the antenna removed.\nI should have returned the TRX-1 as I believe the Unidens are a much better quality radio and easier to use. They have a color screen that is lit all the time and give a better description of what you are listening to in a larger format. The TRX-1 must have the backlight shut off to save on batteries so unless bright sunlight hits the screen most of the time you have no clue what you are listening to except for the brief time it lights when it stops on something.\nYet there is something about it that makes me keep it, even though I never know if it will work when I turn it on. I think it is the size and the one county programming plus it does receive modes that the Uniden's do not.\nI may regret it when it quits altogether but for now, dispite it's faults I am keeping it although I do like the Uniden products better as far as ease of use, readability of display, and build quality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:32:50.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The glass on the back of the camera cracked and when I took it to Apple they told me I had to replace the whole phone because that wasn't covered. I called esurranty and they told me they would take care of it. I filed a claim, submitted the document online and they set up the replacement for me at the same apple store. Only this time, I paid $79.00! Esurranty is a life saver and I have and will continue to recommend them to everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T21:14:41.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

However, the reality is that so far this has been a good car seat to purchase.\nI had to buy an isofix seat as for some reason the belted car seats would refuse sit solidly on the leather seats of my car. Having scoured the market most isofix car seats in this range were way out of my budget. So the price of this, Â£79.99 when bought, really swayed me.\nDelivery was quick and the neccessary update emails provided. The seat comes in a good size box but with no styrofoam protection not that bothered me.\nMy first impression was this car seat looked good in quality and durability. The instructions were simple to follow. The isofix slotted on to the anchors of the car quite easily. Just remember to give it a good push so that secures nicely.\nThe harness can be a bit fiddly especially when the little one is in there. The harness is a decent length and the seat is well padded. The cup holder is useful.\nOverall i would definitely recommend this car seat if you are on a budget.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:24:03.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

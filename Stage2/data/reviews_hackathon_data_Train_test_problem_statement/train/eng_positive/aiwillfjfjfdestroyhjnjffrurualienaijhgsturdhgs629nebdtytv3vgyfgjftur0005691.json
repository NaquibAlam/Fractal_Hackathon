Collection and drop off were well managed with friendly and helpful staff. Be aware that petrol is hard to find near the airport and there are extensive road works, the only one we found needed a credit card and put a \"hold\" on $150 for $40 worth of petrol.\nMany of the cheaper NZ firms use very old cars but this one had only done 40,000k and was in excellent condition. Most new Zealanders do not drive far and cars are often economy models with smaller engines and less efficient air conditioning and sound systems than you might be expecting. The good side is they use much less of the horribly expensive petrol and less risk from the low and heavily policed speed limits!\nOverall good value and I would recommend them for private hire rather than the more expensive international firms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:44:01.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have 3 pairs of leggings from fabletics and a tank top and I wear all of them multiple times a week. I love especially my fleece lined long leggings, great in the winter. I also have a bathing suit, the bottoms fit perfectly but the top was a bit too small. I do have an odd bust so I don't blame fabletics for that at all. My only complaint is that I always have problems with their website. It's slow, sometimes glitches out and closes the page, and I wish I could filter my searches more (size, style, more than one color) Other than that I totally love fabletics and will continue to be a loyal VIP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:58:52.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It is now 10.30am and I have just spent 45 minutes with Sam from Travelup going through my problems and individually booking my flight requirements. He was amazing and very patient and I could not fault his service and the pricing. This was 5 star . He rang back 10 minutes after l had left my number even though I could not use a pound sign as requested after my number, as was on landline..\nThere was a glitch in their system re contact, but also nowhere on the website indicating that you could not book these flights after 10pm, as told by Travelup on the phone. Please note this problem and change as it was all very distressing until Sam came to the rescue.\n8am\nI spent five hours last night trying to book flights from Travelup kept thinking it was my fault I was not getting the preferred flights as they changed finding that after the laborious and time consuming process of filling in all the usual info, having 'Paid' was fobbed off with the info that the 'airline' Global Distribution System was down.\nYou could not get through to any of the three email addresses given.\nThe telephone line was only open in office hours and the '24/7' premium line also had a message and was only actually open in office hours.\nSo 8am sharp tried again same results all round. Can only leave a message.\nHave they gone bust?\nHave they falsely taken my card details and its a con?\nCan anyone please let me know. I am getting very concerned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T17:06:58.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

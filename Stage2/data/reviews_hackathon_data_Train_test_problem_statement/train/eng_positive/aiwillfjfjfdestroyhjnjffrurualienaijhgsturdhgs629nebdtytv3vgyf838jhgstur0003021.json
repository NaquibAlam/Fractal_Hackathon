They provided me with great service, offering objective opinions of diamonds that I was considering, emailing me images of diamonds, and suggesting diamonds similar to what I was in the market for. Most importantly, they didn't go for the hard sell, yet they helped me maximize and get excellent bang for my buck. I am thrilled to say that the diamond I purchased was appraised for more than I bought it for. So I am extremely happy with my decision to buy online and from B2C.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T20:14:57.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Reached out to them about it and they sent a replacement power adapter but it did not work either showing that the PS2 console was the problem. They did send the adapter free of charge and responded to my emails in a timely manner.\nOnce I told them that the console was the problem, they sent me another console free of charge and it has been working correctly since I received it. It took some time but in the end I did get what I paid for. Appreciate these guys resolving the issue like they did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T23:20:04.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

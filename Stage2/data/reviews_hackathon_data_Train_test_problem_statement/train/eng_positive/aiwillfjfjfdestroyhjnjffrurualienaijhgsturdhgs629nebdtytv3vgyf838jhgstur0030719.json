Auto Lenders no-haggle pricing ensures a zero pressure buying process. My sales associate Anthony promptly responded to my numerous emails before I visited the dealership. Anthony had three vehicles brought from other locations for me to test drive at my local dealer and even came to work several hours early to accommodate my schedule. He was friendly, knowledgeable and professional. This is my second time buying from Auto Lenders and will definitely not be my last. Thank you for another great experience!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T23:12:23.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It arrived quickly and I was amazed at the quality! All of the corner miters were perfectly flush, no gaps, no unevenness. It was very tight and sturdy. The packaging was excellent, they must have thought of all the ways the shipper could damage something. All of the hardware needed was included, I am extremely happy with my purchase, and the picture I framed looks great hanging above my mantle! Top notch company to deal with!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:35:21.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

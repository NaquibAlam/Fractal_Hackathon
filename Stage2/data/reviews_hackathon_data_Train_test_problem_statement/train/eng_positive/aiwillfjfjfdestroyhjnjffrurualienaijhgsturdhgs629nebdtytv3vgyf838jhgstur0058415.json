I'd actually paid for the first two domains that I \"won\" the day I got notice. But two days later I was surprised to get two mails for each domain asking for payment. I know I'd verified my apyment method of choice when I set things up. So called GoDaddy's billing department and got some real help. They checked everything and then set it up correctly and I was able to pay with the way I wanted to pay. All in a few minutes. Thanks for your help and cheerfulness doing it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T15:46:16.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have been browsing online for the last few weeks and saw a special offer on flights to Australia...I then had a number to call, which connected me to Robert. Can I say that Robert went above and beyond to help me with booking my flight to Australia and then a little getaway with my Mum to Bali while I am back visiting!\nMy time on the phone with this young man was so pleasant and he couldn't have done enough! He gave me all the information that I needed, including when deposits and full amounts need to be paid and tweaked my flight a few days to get me the best deal possible and to save me some money. I am so fussy with everything and nothing was too much for Robert, I received my flight confirmation whilst we were still chatting on the phone, so every thing happened very quickly. Thank you Robert you are a credit to the company. I will definitely be using this companies service again. What Amazing customer service. THANK YOU again!\nKind regards\nA very Happy Customer :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:17:21.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

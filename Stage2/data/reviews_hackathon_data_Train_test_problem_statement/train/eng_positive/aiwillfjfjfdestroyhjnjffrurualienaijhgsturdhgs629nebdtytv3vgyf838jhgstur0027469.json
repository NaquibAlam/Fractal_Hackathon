The artwork printed for our album was slightly dull in how vivid and saturated the art looks. The promotional posters we ordered elsewhere look a little nicer than the actual art in the case. It's a minor gripe. The one major thing I was actually disappointed by was the disc. It has a cheap \"self burned cd\" green tint instead of a store bought major release clear silver look. And the printing on top of the disc was cheap looking. The company that did our prior album had much higher disc printing quality. I'd have gone to them again, but they were bought by DiscMakers.

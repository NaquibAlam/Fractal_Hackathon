Never a complaint. I've bought a lot of metal frames that I enjoy putting together to frame art I've purchased and my kids art. I've also gotten the premade wood frames. Everything is always packaged perfectly and never damaged. All the correct parts included - all the frames have turned out perfectly. The ordering system is also great - I've never made an error or had an issue with fit. Love - has saved me a lot of money and time by not having to go to a framing shop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:56:25.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

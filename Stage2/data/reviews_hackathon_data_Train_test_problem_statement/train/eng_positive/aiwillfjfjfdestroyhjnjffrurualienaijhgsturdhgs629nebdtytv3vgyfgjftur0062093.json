It's a really really good page since you can easily find out which products are worth buying or not though the community, and I think that's pretty important since I don't like being deceived when purchasing something... Literally, my page of reference when I search for asian beauty (plus you get a lot of beauty samples, and not just cheap ones, you get really cool stuff, like face masks which would actually cost you some bucks if you bought them yourself...). I could honestly talk about how much I love this page all day... but I really don't want to make this too long. I would honestly recommend to check it out, like I've already done with all of my friends and I've let them try the best products and now they love it too (I'm kinda creating a religion here) hahaha.

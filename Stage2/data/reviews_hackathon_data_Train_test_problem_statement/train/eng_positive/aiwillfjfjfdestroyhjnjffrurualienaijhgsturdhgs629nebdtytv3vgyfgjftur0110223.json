YesStyle provides us with great products for low prices!\nThe site was recommended by a friend of my, and I've been shopping there for my make-up ever since.\nEven though the order takes a while, it's always neatly packed, and no damage what so ever. In my opinion, this kind of service is hard to find these days. Especially where I live.\nI could recommend buying at YesStyle to everyone!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:30:35.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

You would think that such a good price would come with strings attached, like not being able to use Paypal, or having to pay for shipping, etc. But that was not the case with Cash4books.\nThey paid for the shipping label. I don't remember if there was a minimum, but if there was, it wasn't something ridiculous like $50. They ask you to ship within a certain window of time, which is pretty standard for book buyback services. Although I never have a problem shipping within this window, they do say that they are flexible if you need a couple more days, which is much appreciated, especially given how crappy the weather can be where I am. They do payment through Paypal (some sites don't, unbelievably), and payment was super prompt! They also included my order # in the comments of their Paypal payment, which was again, quite nice, since it lets me keep track of what's what.\nTL;DR They made the whole process very easy, and they offered the best prices for most of the books I needed to get rid of. 10/10 would recommend", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T14:39:09.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

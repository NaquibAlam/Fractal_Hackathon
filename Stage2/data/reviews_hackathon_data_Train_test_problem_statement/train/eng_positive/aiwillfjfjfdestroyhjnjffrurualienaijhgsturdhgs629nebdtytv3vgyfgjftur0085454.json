It has made it so much easier for him to contact the family members registered on it (we have 10) & also for us to contact him, as he had no idea how to use the latest technology phones. Like a couple of other people mentioned, we too had to purchase another one last December when Telstra switched off the 2G service. The phone is great, the ordering process is fast and easy & the couple of occasions I have had to call customer service they were very helpful and resolved the problem in no time.\nMy only comments are:\n1. that it is very easy to accidentally call a number. My brother has done this on a number of occasions leading us to call him back thinking that there was something wrong.\n2. When he has said that there's been a call there's no way of knowing who has called - but without a screen I don't know what the answer to this would be.\nI have no hesitation in recommending the KISA phone, my brother goes to respite a couple of days a week and I have mentioned the phone to the carers there.\nJust one question, can you please advise if there is a case available that will fit the KISA phone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T20:27:24.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

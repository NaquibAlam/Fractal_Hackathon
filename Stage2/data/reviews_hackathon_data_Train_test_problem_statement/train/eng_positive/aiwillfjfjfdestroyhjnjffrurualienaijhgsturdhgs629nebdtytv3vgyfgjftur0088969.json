Thank you.\nI ordered flowers for Valentines day a few days in advance only to be emailed the night of Valentines day saying they were too busy to deliver the flowers and they would be sent the next day. I cancelled the order immediately as the delivery was to a hotel and my wife was checking out that day. Needless to say I've never been contacted by Floraqueen and I was charged the full amount for the pleasure.\nTerrible customer service, no contact made whatsoever after numerous attempts to contact.\nWill not be using again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:48:15.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

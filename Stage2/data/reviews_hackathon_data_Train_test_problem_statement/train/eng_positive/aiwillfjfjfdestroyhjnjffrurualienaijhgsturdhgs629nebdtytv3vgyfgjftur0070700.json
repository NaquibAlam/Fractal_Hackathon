But I have one thing that bugs me when I purchase mat 8 and the mat 11. On your website it states the mat 11 come in packs of\n25 . That is not true . When I pick them up they are loose and not in packs. If they would come packaged in bundles of 25 like you say it would be easy to look and see exactly what I have in stock. I really can't tell what I have when I pick up 500 or more when they are loose. I actually counted them a month ago and found my order was short. This is the first time I did so all these years I have been buying from you. If they were in bundles I think I wouldn't have been shorted. If I had them stacked in bundles of 25 I could easily know what my inventory is without counting them. Every time I come for a pickup I have to request for them to be bundled. Sometimes they do it sometimes they don't. If you say they come in packs of 25 that is the way you should give them to customers. It would protect you and the customer. Otherwise everything is great especially your staff. A special Thanks to Nina and Franco for all the great service over the years.\nThanks\nAngel C Stephan\n530.919.6674", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:56:53.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

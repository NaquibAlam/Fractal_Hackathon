I have dealt with you on four or five previous occasions, and this latest one tops all the others. Our agent, Brian Holden, was very solicitous of us for the whole duration of the transaction. Even after the notification that the merchandise would be shipped from Delaware, and the receipt of the tracking numbers, he called every day to let us know what the status was, right up until the day we received the coins. Then again the next day to see if we were happy with the whole process. I told him that it was the most enjoyable of all the previous ones because we were not left out there in limbo land wondering just where things stood. All in all, a truly enjoyable exercise right up and until I told him we had received everything and that it was all safely buried in the back yard!\nThanks again folks, and if I can ever scrape up some more of that green paper, I'll be turning it into metal using this newfangled internet alchemy!\nBest Regards, Everett R Littlefield", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T11:57:14.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

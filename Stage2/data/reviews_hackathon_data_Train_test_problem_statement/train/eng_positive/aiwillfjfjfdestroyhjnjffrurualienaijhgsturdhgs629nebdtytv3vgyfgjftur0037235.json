Then my kitten died, and I didn't want to ever worry about cost again during a pet's last moments. I was determined to find the best plan. I spent hours comparing policies, but I didn't need to. Figo had the best coverage and the best price -- and no cost in life-threatening emergencies. The site is beautiful and easy and the whole experience has just been so positive. My pet is treated like family. Bafflingly good!

I had minimal shedding and the packaging was stable! My last order lasted about a month and half, but I am a college student (I party, swim, physically active, late nights, and sexually active which also took a toll on my clips lol) and it would have lasted longer with better care and softer conditions... And usually care for my hair pretty well! My most vitaal piece of advice is to take time and FINGER DETANGLE... whether you brush out the curls or not, do not continually bush and comb because the hair will thin out VERY quickly!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:12:20.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

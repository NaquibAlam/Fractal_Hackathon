The frames are quite good however the expensive lens quality is OK..not great...but the fitting of lens in frames I am very disappointed. The lens are loose, rattle and creak inside the frames. Its almost as if the technician who was responsible for cutting the lens used the wrong lens template. Everytime I clean the lens they creak because they were not seated and sized correctly. I'm very disappointed and doubt I will purchase again.\nI wanted to personally thank you for handling my return of my Rx Persol Sunglasses and ensuring the new pair was redone to my satisfaction. The turnaround was amazing and so were you. Outstanding customer service. Keep up the good work\nI wanted to personally thank you for handling my return of my Rx Persol Sunglasses and ensuring the new pair was redone to my satisfaction.

I decided to take a look and was amazed by the variety of the products, sorted accordingly and with accurate description! Then I took the chance to order for the 1st time; the order arrived in 2 workdays and the packaging was great, preventing any damage to the game! The arrival time and the perfect package are the most important things for me, thus I'm using this seller till now!\nOf course someone may notice that certain games have a slightly higher price compared to other sellers, but 365games.co.uk implemented a great loyal-customer-service by rewarding you points for every purchases to convert into GBP and use as a voucher on future orders, no matter if they are pre-orders or released titles/hardware!\nThe only thing that's missing are the customer comments and rating on the titles/hardware! 365games.co.uk have to find a way to receive much. much more comments and ratings from users on the items for sale!\nIn conslusion - I have trust in the site and hope to do business in the future, even after the Brexit!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T00:09:30.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

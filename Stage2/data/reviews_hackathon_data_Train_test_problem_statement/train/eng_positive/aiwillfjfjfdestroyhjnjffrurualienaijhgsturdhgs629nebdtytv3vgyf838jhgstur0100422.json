It allows my wife to be home with our son more so than having a full time career.\nLyft also provides the opportunity to connect with people on many levels. Who knows, maybe my next career move might be by meeting a rider that has an opportunity in a field of work that I do. Maybe that next rider will help me broaden and enrich my life.\nI have the opportunity to meet people that are not like me to ask questions and listen to the thoughts, opinions, passions of their making.\nLygt helps me fulfill my purpose in helping others in a way. I never know what that next rider is going through but I'm always open to listening and engaging in conversations.\nThe culture the Lyft is creating is awesome. There really has not been a bad ride yet for me. Some weird, some a little sketchy, and some quiet but overall the riders are awesome.\nThere are a few downsides to using your own car and not knowing if a rider is going to take you 20 miles away from your home at the end of the night but those are far outweighed by the positives.\nLyft also provides the driver to earn 95% of their money plus tips. I'm not sure if other rideshare platforms do that. It's not a bad way to make a little extra coin for me. I do love it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:08:08.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Recently, I used Bake A Wish products twice. In the first instance, I sent my adult son a sheet cake of, what I call super duper chocolate. He loved it. It was his favorite. Next I was having a large party and remembered Bake A Wish. I supplemented my menu with their quiches (scrumptious) and their desserts -- the chocolate mousse cake and the New York Cheesecake. Both were big hits. I highly recommend Bake A Wish for any of their bakery and gourmet products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:47:41.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

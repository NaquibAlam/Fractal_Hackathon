My passport did not have 6 months of validity and needed this to travel and get the visa on time. It felt a bit like mission impossible but i spoke with the Fastport team and they walked me through the process in about 20 minutes. I did have a bunch of questions but the instructions did answer most of them. I prepared the documents and off to Fedex i went. They did send me a label to ship in my application. I only had to make one phone call to calm my nerves to find out the passport was renewed and the visa was now in process. I have just received the passport this morning with the visa. Very relieved, Very Happy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T12:00:38.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It is well made and a beautiful piece of furniture and complements my decor well. Although it was a long wait, it was worth it. The delivery men were excellent and the customer rep, Iggy, was quite helpful and understanding of all my concerns. Would definitely purchase from again. I believe they are going to soon open a showroom in NYC so am looking forward to seeing the furniture in person.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:00:58.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

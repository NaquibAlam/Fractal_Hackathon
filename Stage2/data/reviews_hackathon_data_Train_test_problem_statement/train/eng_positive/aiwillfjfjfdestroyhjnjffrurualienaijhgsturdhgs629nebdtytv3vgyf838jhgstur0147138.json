Amazing customer service, my husband and I felt welcomed as soon as we walked in. We were nervous being 1st time buyers and having 0 credit after being turned away by so many other places. She said she wouldn't get our hopes up but asked what we were looking for and she would do her best to get us in that car! After going over everything we got approved! Only needed around $2100 down and we had $3000 already! Got to go outside pick which one we wanted to test drive and get a feel for then we did the full inspection on everything. I'm so happy that we got Faith, she made my husband and I really understand what we were signing and all the percs we had too. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND coming here if you need help with getting put in a car. Thank you guys so much for my 2015 Chrysler 200 ðŸ’ŽðŸ’–", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T18:13:56.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

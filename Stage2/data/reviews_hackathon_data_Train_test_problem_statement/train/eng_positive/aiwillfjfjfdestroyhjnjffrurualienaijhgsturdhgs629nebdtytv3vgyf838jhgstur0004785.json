Out of about 50 purchases, this is the only one purchased with the additional \"insurance\", so I'm not sure if it was the insurance or good customer service that got me a replacement.The Pi itself was smashed on one corner. Banggood replace the entire order. Yes, it took a month, but, that's okay. I bought 3 more in the meantime, and started using Arduino microcontrollers instead. It's nice to know that Banggood takes care of these things. Thank you Banggood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T12:20:51.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

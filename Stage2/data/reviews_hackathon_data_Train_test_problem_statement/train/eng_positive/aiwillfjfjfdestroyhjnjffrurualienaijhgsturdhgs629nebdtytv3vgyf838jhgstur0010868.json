They provide a one on one experience with a knowledgable gemologist, Shaun, who truly cares about what YOU want, and will work with you to make a beautiful piece of jewelry! After I designed my wedding ring with my fianc√©, they provided me with a 3D print! How awesome is that?! So neat! When I first thought of designing my own wedding ring, I thought it would be way out of our budget. Come to find out, it probably would have been the same price as a large jewelry store. But instead, I got to design my own ring, rather than having to just choose a ring I \"think\" I liked at a large store, and have a personal one on one experience with the best (Shaun & Hossley). Indy Facets by far exceeded my expectations!

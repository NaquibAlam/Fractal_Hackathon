She is able to fulfil her duties in a very professional manner while being cheery and pleasant. She is 'present' for all our conversations and I enjoy speaking with her. Samantha makes me feel like she is there to serve and help me and not to display her self-importance or position in the organisation.\nI'm also very satisfied with the way Erin answers calls and conveys messages. This provides a sense of confidence when I'm away and not able to attend to calls, knowing that the calls will be answered in a professional and friendly manner with the opportunity to respond to clients in a timely manner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T15:30:53.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

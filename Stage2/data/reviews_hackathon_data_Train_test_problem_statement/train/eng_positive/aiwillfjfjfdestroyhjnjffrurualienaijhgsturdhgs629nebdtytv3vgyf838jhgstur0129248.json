At first I wasn't sure it would be helpful, there's a lot of competition on here and I only had external reviews. Then someone took a chance on me, and I on them, and the rest is history!\nIn the past 9 months I have been to 5 different countries on 3 continents, met some wonderful people and had amazing experiences and did so on a budget! Not to mention the joy of a furry companion along the way!\n4 stars, there's still a few things I wish they would do with the website to make searching and communicating easier but when the time came to renew my membership recently I did so without hesitation. I still have some traveling to do!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:17:52.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

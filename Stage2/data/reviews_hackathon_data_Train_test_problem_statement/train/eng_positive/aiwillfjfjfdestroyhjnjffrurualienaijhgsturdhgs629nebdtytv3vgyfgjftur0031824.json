I ordered the transmission on a Friday and it arrived at my mechanics shop on Tuesday. I drove away Thursday $600-$1000 less than any other option that I had. My daughters explorer drives better than ever, it shifts well and her gas mileage is 2 mpg better than before also.\nMy mechanic, who has been a ford mechanic for over 40 years was impressed with the quality of work and convenience of delivery and return of the core.

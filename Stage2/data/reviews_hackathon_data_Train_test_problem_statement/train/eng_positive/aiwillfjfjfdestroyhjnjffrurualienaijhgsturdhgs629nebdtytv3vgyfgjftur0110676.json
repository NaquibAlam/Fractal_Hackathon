She asked what we were needing today, and we told her a living room suit. She immediately told us that she does not work for commission and that she would be available for any questions. I worked in the customer service industry for 20 years and I know what the commission sales associate has to do to make the sell. She did not \"hound\" on us and let us look around with ease and comfort. This made my experience in your store much easier to look around and shop without any hassles or overbearing sales associates. My wife and I decided on a small sectional couch that will suit our needs quite efficiently. I will recommend this store to any person asking for furniture advice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:18:57.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

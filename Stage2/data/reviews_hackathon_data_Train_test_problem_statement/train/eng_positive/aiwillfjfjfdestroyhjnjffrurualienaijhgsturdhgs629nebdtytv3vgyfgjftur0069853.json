The bike looks great, it's light and easy to ride (gears change smoothly etc), and at the price you really can't beat it. I bought a small sized bike, as I'm only 164cm/5\"4 tall. The only thing I feel is that if I were much shorter, the bike would be a bit big. Overall, it's a fabulous product and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Reid Cycles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T15:36:55.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

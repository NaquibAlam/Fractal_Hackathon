Even though the Canon I settled on is considered a lower end model, B&H had it and a few other potential candidates in stock with expedited shipping;\nTheir potential competitors? I did not even look at one store due to bad customer service (Best Buy), and they would not have had this particular printer in their stores. The other online retailer I looked at did not have anything able to handle larger papers without moving to an expensive wide carriage plotter, and their selection was limited in the area of printers suitable for photography.\nIf at some point I need to \"move up\" from this printer, I'll be back. When I get a darkroom set up again, I will be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T12:36:30.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

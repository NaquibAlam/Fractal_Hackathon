We visited Buenos Aires, Iguazu Falls, Bariloche and Patagonia (Ushuaia and El Calafate). Everything went very smoothly. Our guides were knowledgeable, with some being truly outstanding. Our hotels were small but very comfortable and reflected local culture. Food was fantastic and we wish we could have more steak. We thought Vaya did a great job and are using them to help us plan a trip to Chile for next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T16:19:02.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

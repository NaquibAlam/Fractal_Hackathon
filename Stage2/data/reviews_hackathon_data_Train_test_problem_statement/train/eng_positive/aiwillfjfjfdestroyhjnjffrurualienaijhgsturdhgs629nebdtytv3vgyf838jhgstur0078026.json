John Medina was very helpful, answered all my questions, and assisted us with the best carpet for our home. I really liked the extra steps they take in clean up and spraying a microbial before the new carpet was installed. Our family is very happy with the new carpet, the installation process and I really like the warranty. I would recommend Carpet One to any other options based on their product options, service and warranty!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T17:35:27.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

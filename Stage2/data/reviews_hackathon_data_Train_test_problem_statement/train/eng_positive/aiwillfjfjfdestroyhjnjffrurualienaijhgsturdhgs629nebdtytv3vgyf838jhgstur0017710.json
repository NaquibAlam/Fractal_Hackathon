Out of the box, they look amazing! Fantastic quality products. My only complaint is in the installation. My bike specific bags were not bike specific at all. Holes were already pre drilled giving me unnecessary holes in the bags. Bike specific to me would seem like at least the pre drilled holes were in the right place. The relocation kit installation was almost a joke. I had to purchase shorter bolts so that everything wouldn't rub up against my wheel. I'm not 100% happy with the look of the relocation kit, but it was a necessary evil. Overall, I'm happy with the way it turned out and the price was great. Just wish all the other stuff didn't go down like it did", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T20:32:11.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

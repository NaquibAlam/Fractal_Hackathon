She gave us many good suggestions on sightseeing, food and accommodation . We ended up with a 14-day trip exploring three Wonders of the World! The trip was well paced according to our liking. Jobi was mindful of our likes and preferences, and indeed commendable in her efforts to ensure we were comfortable & well looked after in every city. For example, she made sure each hotel we stayed in were well aware of our food allergies; and we were so impressed that one of the hotel team already knew of our preferences when we dialed for room service) !\nJobi also took time to attend to the many questions we had prior to trip.\nJacada' recommended local guides and concerige sevices were well received. They were always on time and waiting at every destination. This is especially crucial for us as we were traveling across the world to a very foreign land.\nThoroughly enjoyed ourselves!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:10:53.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

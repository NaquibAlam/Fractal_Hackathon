We worked with Justin, and he planned an amazing trip for us. We were in the country almost three weeks, and visited 6 different locations. All plane, car and boat transfers were arranged prior to our visit, and no effort was required on our part. All we had to do was to show up at the time specified in our itinerary--no vouchers or paperwork to keep track of. Each driver was personable, professional and spoke English. We had a couple of questions during our stay, and the travel group got back to us within minutes when we texted, even on weekends. The properties Justin recommended were exceptional, and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this group to others. Their efforts made our trip incredibly easy and enjoyable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:46:58.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

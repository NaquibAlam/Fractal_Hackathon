The designers were all fantastic to work with and were so patient through the revision process. I believe the pricing was extremely reasonable, given how much value I got out of using this service. And to top it all off, I discovered some great designers who I have added as \"favourites\" that I hope to work with when the next project for my business comes along.\nI am SO happy. The world has never seen a more satisfied customer.

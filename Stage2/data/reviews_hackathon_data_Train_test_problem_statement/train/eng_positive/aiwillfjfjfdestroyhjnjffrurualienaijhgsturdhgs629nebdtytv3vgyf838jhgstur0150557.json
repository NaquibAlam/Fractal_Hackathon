Ashlen did a fantastic job of working with me to design a custom pendent featuring a colorful assortment of sapphires that my husband and I mined in Montana and had faceted there. It was such an exciting process to sit down with Ashlen talk about designs, play around with ideas and sketches, and finally arrive at a design. She listened very closely to my ideas and preferences, and she seemed to have an almost intuitive sense of what I had in mind. She sent regular updates and photos of the piece as it moved through the production process. It was such a great experience and the resulting pendent far exceeded my hopes! It is beautiful and beautifully crafted. I couldn't be happier!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T10:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:09:59.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

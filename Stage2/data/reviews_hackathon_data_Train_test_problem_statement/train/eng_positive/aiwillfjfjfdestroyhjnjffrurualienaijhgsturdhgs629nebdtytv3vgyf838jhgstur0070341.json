I was a bit dubious but decided to give it a go and thank goodness I did. When joining, I did have a bit of an IT failure, but the helpdesk instant chat managed to help sort it out. I then found a great housesitter for my five cats and two hamsters. It was lovely and reassuring to have someone in the house and the difference between the cats coming back from a cattery stressed and unsettled and coming back to them in their normal environment was worth its weight in gold. I would recommend this company and will be using them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:54:09.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

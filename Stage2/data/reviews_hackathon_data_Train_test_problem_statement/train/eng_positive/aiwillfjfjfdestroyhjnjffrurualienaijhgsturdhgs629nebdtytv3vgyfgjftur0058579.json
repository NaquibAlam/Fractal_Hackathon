To tell you the truth, my experience with this website has been nothing but great. The staff and administrators are very friendly and they exceed to help you get started. At first I was worried, like most people, about potential scams and such, but I decided to take the risk, after reading an AMA on Reddit.\nAs soon as I made an order, someone contacted me to ensure I was being helped and the process went smoothly. I got connected to a awesome booster, who was nice, helpful, and comical.\nWatching my booster play was the best experience out of this. You learn so much for the role you want to play, and from 10 games, I learned so much to improve my games.\nAll in all, excellent service, friendly staff, awesome and skilled boosters = I will come back for more. :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:20:51.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

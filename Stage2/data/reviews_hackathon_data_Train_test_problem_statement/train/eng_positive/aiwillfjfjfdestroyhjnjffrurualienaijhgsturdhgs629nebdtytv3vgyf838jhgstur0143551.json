She guided me well about what to do next which was purely my own pain but she took it as her own problem and advised the best I could do. Later on she also realized that may the address format may not be correct, she took extra effort to confirm that which otherwise would have made me wait for another 2-3 weeks. Eventually she found that the address format (since it is a granny flat) that I gave was not the correct one. I appreciate the effort Compare Broadband takes to give best possible advice to their customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:27:51.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Whenever I make a first purchase from an online company - I am very skeptical/unsure/worried how it will turn out. The prices there are very good and the process is simple. They even accommodate a variety of ways to submit your prescription so ordering is simple. I received both a confirmation of my order and an email from a staff optician. She verified what I really wanted (some times we don't communicate what we actually need...) and explained the process/timetable. I received my glasses in perfect condition and within the expected time frame. OK, here is the best part - the frame is the genuine item and the prescription lenses are excellent! I am amazed at how well I can see while driving! I'm able to read small print on signs, everything is crisp and clear, and the fit is as close to perfect as it could be. The second best part is they were a very reasonable price, over $100.00 less than other optical sites. I was so impressed with the experience I ordered another pair of sunglasses and have already received them. I wanted to wait until I had a chance to use the glasses for a few long drives before I posted anything. Sorry for rambling and I hope everyone has the same great experience that I had.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:55:44.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We enjoyed using the heated pool ever day (especially my 8 month old grandson) and made good use of the barbecue. The villa was very secure and in a very nice area just a short stroll from the centre of Playa Blanca.\nIt was reassuring to know that support was available if required and when we reported a problem with a DVD player a member of the team arrived within a few hours and sorted it along with the washing machine that we had a problem with while he was there.\nWould highly recommend optima villas and look forward to using them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:57:29.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

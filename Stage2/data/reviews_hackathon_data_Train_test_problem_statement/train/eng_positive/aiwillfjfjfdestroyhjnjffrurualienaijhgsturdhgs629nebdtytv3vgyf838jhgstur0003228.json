The agent had rebooked again, and the hotel confirmed my reservation.\nThe reservation a bit difference with my original reservation but I accepted it. If compare with the room rate I got, the price still very good.\nThanks again for your support, Ben :D", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T08:31:12.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

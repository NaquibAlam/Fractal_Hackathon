I priced local and national suppliers and tyres on the road were within a few pounds of the lowest price. Initial contact was via the website which was clear and easy to use, second contact ( within 30 min) came via a phone call suggesting a more convenient fitting time and date, which was confirmed by email immediately.\nOn the day of fitting I was given a two hour time window by email, the fitter arrived within the time window and rang me to confirm his eta.\nThe two tyres were changed within 30min, the fitter Leon provided an excellent service; polite, pleasant and professional, he explained the work he was going to complete, the checks he would make and agreed each step with me personally before proceeding. Overall a first class service from beginning to end, will certainly use again .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:28:05.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Whenever we have a question or concern regarding these devices, WWS is always willing to take time and help us--most times via telephone.\nMost recently we had a problem with our cd/dvd player and took it to their store in Montgomeryville. Adam D. greeted us and went right to work diagnosing the problem. He was excellent: courteous and knowledgeable. To solve the problem, we needed a service technician to replace some cables and reconnect the player to our system at home.\nThe following week, Paul R. came and did the job. He was friendly,\npleasant, and tidy. He explained what he was doing and answered our questions.\nIt is nice to know quality and caring services still exist! World Wide Stereo is place you can find them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:39:02.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

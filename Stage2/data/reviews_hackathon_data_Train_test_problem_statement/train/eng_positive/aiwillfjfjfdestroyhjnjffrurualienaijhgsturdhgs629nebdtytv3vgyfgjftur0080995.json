Firefly rental, even though they are part of a larger respected international company, will not accept this and despite arguments, like a number of other operators they will insist on you having their insurance when it is not necessary. I have never received a reply when emailing them on this subject.\nIf rental companies offer a full to full option, there should be absolutely no charge levied if you return the car full as it involves no action from the company whatsoever. I accept that if they have to refuel the car there is an obvious cost and gladly pay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:11:19.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

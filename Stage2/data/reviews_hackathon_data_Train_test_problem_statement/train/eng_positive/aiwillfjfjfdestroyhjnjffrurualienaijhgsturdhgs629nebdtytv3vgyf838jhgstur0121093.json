Great navigation and everything is easy to find. I purchased a Vetements tshirt, shipping was fast and decently priced. I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't any luxury feeling with the packaging or service however. This isn't anything to complain about necessarily, but some other retailers take pride in this, and it really shows when they do. It'd be great to see Ssense join this and become a true high end luxury retailer", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:50:38.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

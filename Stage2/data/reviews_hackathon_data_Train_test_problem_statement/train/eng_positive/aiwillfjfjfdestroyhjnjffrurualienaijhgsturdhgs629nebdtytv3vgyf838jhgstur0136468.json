Our itinerary was busy but manageable. Paula had briefed us well about the types of driving we would encounter in New Zealand. We were happy to have travelled the month of February and into March because we did not encounter lots of tourists. The weather was a comfortable 23-33celcius. We found the farmstays geared more to urban folks as opposed to rural folks. We were looking for more of a working farm experience.\nWe were provided with a self drive itinerary for New Zealand and the Great Ocean Drive in Australia but had no info for our drive from Cairns to the Atherton Tableland. We were uncomfortable with the GPS provided for us in Australia by Hertz. We had no map for a route out of Cairns and chose the easy route to our B&B to the tablelands. This route was the Gillles Hwy.which we were told even the locals don't drive at night! Unfortunately it was dark and rainy!\nOverall we were very happy with our experiences both with Goway,Paula and our trip. I'm so happy Paula encouraged us to try some of the adventures we had. They made our trip!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T10:21:58.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

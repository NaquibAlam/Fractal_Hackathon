I'm reversing the NEGATIVE to POSITIVE review, as the customers service of Clearbags, responded immediately to my attention regarding my complaint on, Tricky Description. It was a misunderstanding of description, between CD Business card clear bag to CD sleeve.\nEllyse, the costumers service manager, was considerately understanding to where I stood. It was a misinterpretation of the AD as advertised. She refunded my money back to my account, in full. Very PROFESSIONAL and CARING for customers being. I will do business with this company even in a very small scale, for the reason of Professionalism in dealing with customers. Please post this reversal review for viewers to read. Much appreciated and thank you.\nSatisfied customer,\nReynaldo Padua", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T14:06:46.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My 3 year old poodle would come from a local kennel that was very expensive and have nightmares after that I had to wake her from after a stay. But by leaving them with a family that I got to pick and interview I knew we would have a much better experience for our dogs. And they truly came home happy!!! My dogs are spoiled and are not use to being locked in a kennel at night and jailed. They are part of our family and sleep with us. It was fantastic to find a home away from home for a spoiled furry friends when we need to be away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:03:51.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The original rug went back with free shipping and the correct size came back, also free shipping. Everything is programmed and if needed, a service person answers any questions within hours.\nI did not shop locally first so I cannot compare their pricing but they do offer discounts and sale items.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T13:32:52.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

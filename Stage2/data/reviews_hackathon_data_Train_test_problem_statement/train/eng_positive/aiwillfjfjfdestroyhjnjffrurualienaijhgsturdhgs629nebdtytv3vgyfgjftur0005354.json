The car was excellent and great value for money .\nMy only concerns were , that when I made the online booking , I selected the full insurance waiver option , only to discover later that this insurance is provided by a third party , which , in the event of a claim , would have involved paying \" Enterprise \" $2,500 excess , then having to go through the process of claiming it back through the insurance company . The customer service person then told me on arrival , that I could have elected this waiver when I picked up the car , no where on the website was this shown when booking online .\nMy second concern was , when dropping off the car , there was no one to inspect it on arrival , the customer service person at the desk told me he \" would get to it later on in the day \" , obviously I wanted him to see that there was no damage to the car on arrival , so I was concerned that any damage that may have been caused after my arrival , while the car was parked in a very busy parking area , may have been suspected of being my fault and being caused before my arrival at the parking area .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:01:33.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

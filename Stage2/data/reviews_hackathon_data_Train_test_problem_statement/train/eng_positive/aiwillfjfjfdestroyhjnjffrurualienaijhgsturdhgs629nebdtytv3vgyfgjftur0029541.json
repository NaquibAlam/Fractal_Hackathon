Having read some negative reviews regarding amoma.com I was slightly apprehensive about booking through them but considering how much cheaper they are I decided to give them a go. Booking was easy and costs transparent. When I arrived at the hotel checking in was quick and easy. Unfortunately, the hotel had my booking under a twin room rather than a double. I called amoma customer support on a Saturday evening and immediately spoke to an advisor who called the hotel directly\nresolved the issue and called me back to explain everything. I was moved to a double room and have no concerns using amoma again. Way cheaper than other third party booking websites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:32:24.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

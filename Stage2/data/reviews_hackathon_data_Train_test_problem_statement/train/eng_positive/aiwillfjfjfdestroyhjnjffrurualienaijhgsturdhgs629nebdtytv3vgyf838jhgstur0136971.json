However, if one believes that the true measure of a company is not how well they do handling routine and uneventful processes, but rather how well they respond to problems, then Banggood is definitely a cut above. I recently needed to contact their customer support about an unordered package that showed up at my door, which apparently had gotten mixed up with an order I did not receive. Their response time was exceptionally fast throughout our correspondence, although their comprehension of English was sometimes lacking and I had to repeat several statements. That aside, their response consistently demonstrated their commitment to resolving my issue and ensuring my satisfaction. I would have no hesitation in recommending Banggood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:53:44.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The thought of a birthday cake had me searching the web. I came upon Bake Me A Wish and was excited by the different things they could do. Needless to say, my mom was delighted by all the goodies that showed up on her door! She said everything was so good and really made her day. Thank you Bake Me A Wish for making my mother's birthday such a special day - the only thing i could have used was some birthday candles along with the cake!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:49:55.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

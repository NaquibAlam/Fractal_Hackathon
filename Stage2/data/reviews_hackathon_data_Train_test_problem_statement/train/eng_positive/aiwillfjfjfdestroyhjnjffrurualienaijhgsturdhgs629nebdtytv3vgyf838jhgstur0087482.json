They had them at a great price and shipping was meant to take about 5 days but they ended up arriving after only 2 days, stoked! The headphones themselves are freaking sweet too. Perfect for use while recording in my home studio and while at work writing code all day. They are so comfortable that I can wear them for a full 8 hour day without even noticing, unlike my old in-ears that they replaced which would start to get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T02:46:00.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We couldn't find the frames anywhere in Australia and I scoured the internet trying to find stockists, including contacting the international manufacturer. The Australian distributor could get them in, but we'd have to purchase them through an optometrist, and the prices Quote: d were exorbitant! After contacting CoolFrames to ascertain if the frames we wanted were in stock, they replied promptly to say they could get them and came up with the best price we could find anywhere. We were well informed during the ordering process, the frames arrived as promptly as expected for international delivery and everything is fine with my husband's new glasses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:48:56.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The designs are innovative & unique, the fabric is top-notch quality and the variety of prints/solids/styles/separates is by far superior to other sites I order from. The quality and longevity of their products amaze me every time when I look at the price! What's most special is having somewhat of a personal shopper picking outfits for you monthly and guiding you to things maybe you wouldn't have normally considered. I really feel confident in the clothing and look like I'd fit in on the streets of L.A.!! I just wish I had more $$ to spend in my monthly budget because I'd happily re-do my wardrobe with nothing but fabulous FABletics!! Kate move over because I am absolutely, positively and definitely with NO doubt FABletics NEW #1 fan!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T11:08:59.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

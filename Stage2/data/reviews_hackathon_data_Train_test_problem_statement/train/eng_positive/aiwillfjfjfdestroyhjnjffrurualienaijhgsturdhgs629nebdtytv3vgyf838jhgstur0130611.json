Before I purchase the parts I gave them a call just to gather some extra info about the new parts that I wanted. The people at Procivic were very helpful to explain me what will be the best option and also what will help to improve it's performance. Once I place the order for the new parts for my car it did not took that long to get them which it was pretty awesome. Keep up the great work Procivic and thank you for your help and time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T12:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:29:46.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

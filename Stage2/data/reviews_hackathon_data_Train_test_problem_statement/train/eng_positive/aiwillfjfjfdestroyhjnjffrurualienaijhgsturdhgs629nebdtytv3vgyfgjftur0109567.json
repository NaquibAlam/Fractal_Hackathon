We originally found them based on their excellent reviews. We were looking for a reliable and mainly easy moving solution as we have small children and we had moved previously and knew what stress it was to try move everything to a moving truck in just few hours etc. This was completely different and so convenient solution to pack staff in our own pace to a taxibox in our driveway. One thing to mention is an outstanding communication of taxibox team. They were so easy to deal with and mainly reasonable. I never hesitated to contact them and discuss anything I needed and it made our lives so much easier. When we were moving to a new place and taking our staff out of Taxibox, we decided to use one of their recommended removalists and it was again a win. Our move to a new place was set up with a very tight schedule that relied on Taxibox and the removalists and their reliability. And it all went well ! We recommended Taxibox to our friends since and they were very happy too. We just wish Taxibox started to service larger area than they currently do as it is such a convenient and reliable company. We would use them again with no hesitation if we were not living out of their area. We definitely recommend Taxibox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:19:44.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

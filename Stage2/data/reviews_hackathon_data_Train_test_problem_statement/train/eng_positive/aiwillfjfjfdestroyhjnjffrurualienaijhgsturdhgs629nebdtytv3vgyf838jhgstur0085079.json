Iceland, italy, irelnd and now im going to vietnam. I recommend this to anyone on a buget. Cons. You have to undertand that the tickets re cheap so there are long flights and some long layovers. To me that con turns into a pro becuase i take advantage of long layovers and i visit what every city im having a layover in. Even though it may be short but becuase of layovers ive been to amsterdam, england, norway and will be in china soon. . I dont sit in the airport. I seize the moment and go to the cloest city and have an experience of a life time. Even if its for a couple hours i get visit places not on my agenda list. To me thats what travelling is all about.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T13:59:15.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

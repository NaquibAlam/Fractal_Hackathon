I was really hesitant to buy another vape. I did not want to smoke from a bowl any more so after starting the review process again I decided to buy the CFV. I'm so happy with this. I get very nice clouds, its easy to use, its built well.\nThe only thing I hate is that Planet gives you 2 gifts a grinder and a plastic container to hold some of your dry herb, valuing these gifts at $53.00 I DON'T THING SO. Don't get me wrong they are gifts and I appreciate them but don't say they are worth $53.00 say 20.00 Everybody will respect you more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T14:13:30.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

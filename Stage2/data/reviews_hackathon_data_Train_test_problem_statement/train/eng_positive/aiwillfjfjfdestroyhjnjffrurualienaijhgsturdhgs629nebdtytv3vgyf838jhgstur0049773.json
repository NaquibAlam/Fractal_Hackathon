That all being said, it has taken me a long time to find a clothing line that actually fits, is very comfortable, that I am not constantly pulling at, and don't have to worry about exposing myself in. The material is light weight but thick enough to feel secure in. The tops have sleeves that are actually long enough that I don't constantly pull them down. I like my sleeves to go to the middle of my hand comfortably. Above all, this stuff is affordable.

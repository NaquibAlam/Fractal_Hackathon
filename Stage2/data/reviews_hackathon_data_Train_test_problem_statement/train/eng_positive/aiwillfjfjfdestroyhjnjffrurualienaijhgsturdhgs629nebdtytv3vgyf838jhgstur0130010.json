I anticipated it being a long, painful, and tedious process, but it was far from it. It was easy to follow, interesting (to the extent that traffic school can be), and I finished the entire course very quickly. I had dedicated the entire day to do it, but I finished the entire course in a few hours, which included a number of breaks, and I moved at a very leisurely pace. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. What's more, I did not have to submit proof of completion to the court. Traffic School 4 Busy People did all of that for me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T18:05:39.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

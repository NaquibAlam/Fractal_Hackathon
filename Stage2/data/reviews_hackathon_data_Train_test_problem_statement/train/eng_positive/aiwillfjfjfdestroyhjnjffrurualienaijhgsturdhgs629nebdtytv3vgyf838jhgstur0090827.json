The only issue I had was with the airportrentals.com.au website. On both bookings I paid extra insurance to remove the Excess on the rental cars. This turned out to be a totally unrelated insurance cover. Both car rental companies ( Budget & Europcar) stated that if I was to have an accident I would be required to pay the $4000+ Excess to them & then reclaim through the insurance cover on the website. This is not explained clearly on this site & the insurance company address seemed to be based in N.Z. It seemed an unnecessarily convoluted way to organize insurance & I'm glad I did not have to put it to the test.\nI would not use this site again but would go directly through a car rental site & use their insurance cover.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T23:50:05.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The only claim I ever filed due to vandalism to my (previous) car, was handled quickly and efficiently, with little or no payment required on my end. When I switched from a previous auto insurance company, I immediately saved $800 a year! I wish I had signed on with CalCas earlier in my life! When I called in recently to have my policy re-evaluated, I saved even more. When I traded in a car/bought a new car, the transfer of my insurance was done quickly, and the necessary paperwork I needed was emailed to me until the hard copies arrived in the mail. Any agent I have ever spoken to was polite, friendly, and willing to assist me with my particular needs. Great company!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:04:35.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

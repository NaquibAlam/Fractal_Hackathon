Einar showed us around to see the most amazing sights, in a friendly, professional manner. He has a very nice car, provided a wireless hot spot which we all (4 of us) used. He is a wealth of information about the country and culture of Iceland. He helped us tailor each day to our own preferences and was able to offer spontaneous suggestions as we went along. I can wholeheartedly recommend his services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:29:36.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

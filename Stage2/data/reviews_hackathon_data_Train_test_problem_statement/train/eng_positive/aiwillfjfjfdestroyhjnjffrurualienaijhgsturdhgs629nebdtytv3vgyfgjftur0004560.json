Emails were clear and concise.\nI'd booked an anytime Sunday fitting and on early on in the morning I had an email with a 2 hour time slot of between 11.30 & 13.30. In fact they turned up at 10.30 so no complaints there!\nThe two guys who came to change my tyres were polite, friendly and really efficient. One of them was called Adam.\nThey were really quick and my four tyres were changed in no time.\nAfter they left I received two emails, one explaining the work done and one with an invoice which was broken down into what I was paying for.\nI wholeheartedly recommend using them and I certainly will again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:31:46.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

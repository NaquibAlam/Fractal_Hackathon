First time round, step 5 didn't load up but online support were great, immediately on hand and talked me through it very quickly and easily :) Second payment I tried to make the next day, my bank had blocked my account (because of the first transaction...make sure you contact your bank so subsequent payments are not blocked!!!) so I had to put my transfer process on hold another day. While I could easily pick up the transaction so far, there was no 'warning'/recalculation that the rate had changed before I hit 'send' which meant I ended up sending just short of what was required! If you don't complete a transaction in the same day, remember to check the rate or simply redo the transfer so you send what you mean to send! I would also now like to see you can send/transfer from Thai baht :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:37:12.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

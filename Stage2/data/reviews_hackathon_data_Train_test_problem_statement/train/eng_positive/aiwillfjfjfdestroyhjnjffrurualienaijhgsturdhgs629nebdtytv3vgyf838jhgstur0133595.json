You can visit many places in a short period given the speed, timeliness and efficiency of the rail network (most notably the Shinkansen Bullet trains). The seat reservation and bookings system worked well. JR staff are very helpful and polite. Obtaining the JR travel voucher in Australia was easy as well. I now plan to visit Japan every year.\nGary, Sydney.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T19:41:11.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Good-excellent accommodation and food as well as excellent commentary and tour arrangements from the AATKings guide and driver.\nAt the end of the coach tour in Adelaide, we were seamlessly transported to Port Douglas by limmo (at both ends) and Virgin Australia. The only small hick-up came at the Cayman Villas at Port Douglas since we arrived after-hours and the office was closed. This was quickly resolved by using the after-hours telephone. Other than that, everything in Port Douglas was excellent.\nThank you again for everything, and the spectacular service from Georgia Sibley in particular!!\nCheers, George & Pat Wright", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T22:47:33.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

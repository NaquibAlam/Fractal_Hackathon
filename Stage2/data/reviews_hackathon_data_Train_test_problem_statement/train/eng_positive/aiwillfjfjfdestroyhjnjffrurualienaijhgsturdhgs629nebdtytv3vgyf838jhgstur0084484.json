I luckily happened upon Macback's site online, and not only did they offer the largest trade in credit, but they also provided a return shipping label. All i had to do was box up my product and mail it off. Within 2 or 3 days, the money was posted to my Paypal account. Painless, quick and easy! I will definitely use Maxback anytime I need to trade in any electronics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T17:43:31.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

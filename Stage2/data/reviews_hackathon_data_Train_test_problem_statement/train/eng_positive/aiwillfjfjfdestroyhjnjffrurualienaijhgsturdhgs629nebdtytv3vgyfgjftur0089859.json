We have 3 cats along with a green tree frog & a gold fish and previously we have used a cattery facility at our vets and family/ friends to house sit . One of our cats suffers from a medical condition aggravated by stress and often our cattery bill , which is hideously expensive is added to with additional vet bills and the stress of knowing Rocket may be ill while we are away . We explained his condition to our TrustedHouse Sitters and they were fine with any medications and extra care he may have needed . We were delighted when we met our house sitters prior to going away and even more so when we arrived home to a spotlessly clean home , watered and manicured garden and 3 very happy , relaxed and settled cats . I would highly recommend the service to anyone I know & we will definitely be using Trustedhousesitters again in the future !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:44:39.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

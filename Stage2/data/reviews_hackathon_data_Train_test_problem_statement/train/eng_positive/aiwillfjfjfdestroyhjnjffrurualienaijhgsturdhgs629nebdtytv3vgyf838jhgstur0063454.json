So I posted the faulty visor back to them.\nA few days later I received an email stating that they had received the visor, an hour later Another email was received informing me that they have reimbursed the postage that I'd paid, shortly after this another email arrived to let me know that the visor would be replaced, also giving the details of the delivery date with an hour time slot. The visor was delivered yesterday as promised. The after sales support I've had from Helmet City has been brilliant. I would happily recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T19:03:12.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

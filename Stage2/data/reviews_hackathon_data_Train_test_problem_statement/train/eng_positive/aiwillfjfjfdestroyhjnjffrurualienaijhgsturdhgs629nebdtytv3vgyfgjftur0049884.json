I haven't ridden a bike in two decades and felt like I was flying, it is so much fun to ride!\nLuckily I have a friend who put my bike together, so it was hassle free for me. The only feedback I would give is that the colour (watermelon) was very pink compared to the more orange colour displayed online. If I purchased in store I would have chosen a different colour because I'm not a 'pink' girl, but it is growing on me:)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:56:52.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

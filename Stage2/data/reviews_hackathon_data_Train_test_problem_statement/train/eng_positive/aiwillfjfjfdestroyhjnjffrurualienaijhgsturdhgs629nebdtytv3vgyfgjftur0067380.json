My offices really appreciate meals from local restaurants that are not chains. I like being able to see the price per headcount to control my budget. The receipts for events are detailed and clear making my expense reporting much easier. It's great being able to save multiple payment forms when catering is being funded under different budgets, speaker programs vs. say lunch and learn budgets. The ability to re-order a lunch that was a hit with an office is great. With one exception, in the two years that I have been using exCater, customer service has been great. It has so streamlined the meal promotional spend process, I feel like a sales person again and not a caterer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:00:12.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

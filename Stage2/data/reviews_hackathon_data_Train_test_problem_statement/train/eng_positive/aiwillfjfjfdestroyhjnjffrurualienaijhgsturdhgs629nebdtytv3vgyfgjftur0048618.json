A superb and well curated collection that has works that even entry level art collectors can afford. Other art sale sites either offer high quality art that is priced insanely high or offer reaaonably priced art that is more amateurish.\n2. The Desktop version and the app are both superb. Easy to use. Intuitive. Well designed. All the information about the art and artists is all there. And a great feature to \"see\" the art on your wall before you buy it.\n3. All the prices include shipping, regardless from where the art is shipped. This is great. You pay what you pay.\n4. Great customer service. I love that a person is in charge of my art every time I buy something. I can respond to an actual person with questions not into the black hold of customer service email. AND everyone is so responsive and nice.\n5. It's my favorite place to buy art...and I've been buying a lot of art lately :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T21:10:29.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

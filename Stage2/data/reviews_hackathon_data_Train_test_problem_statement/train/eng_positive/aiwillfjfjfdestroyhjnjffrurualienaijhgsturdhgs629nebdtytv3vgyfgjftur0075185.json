It looks a bit sloppy since it has a curved bottom rather than the sharply folded bottom of Sylvia.\nThe Anna also has a simple water level arrangement and also seems to use less of its reservoir to make a cup of cappuccino.\nThe Anna steamer requires several steps which are almost exactly what I did in temperature surfing the Sylvia so Sylvia teaches the right habits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:27:57.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

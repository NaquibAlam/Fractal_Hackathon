I had family\nover to help. I was home for a week. It was Sunday of that week family left. Soon I got really sick to my stomach and vomiting dizziness began. Well I was very scared couldn't move because of my surgery it was an emergency surgery. Long story short I pushed my emergency button of my LifeStation and they were there helping me and keeping me calm. The ambulance came into my apartment and took me to the hospital. I had a very serious infection in my stomach. Funny I only had LifeStation a few weeks. So happy I did. Thank you LifeStation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T15:24:06.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

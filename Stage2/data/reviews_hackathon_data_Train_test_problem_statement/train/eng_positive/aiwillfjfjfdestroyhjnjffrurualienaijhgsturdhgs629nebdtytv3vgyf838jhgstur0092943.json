But when I called dish to order, I was not told I was talking to a third party sales person. They made it sound like they were actually Dish Network themselves that set it all up, I was told I was getting the best hopper, that I was approved for all the upgrades for free. But when the installation came it was just for a lesser one. That I would have to pay an extra $100 if i got the one they said I was approved for. Then I was told on my first phone call that I called them on that the installation would be free I would just have to pay a one-time $50 activation fee. Something went on with my card, I had to call them back. Then i was told it was a $49 installation fee as well as a $50 activation fee but that the $49 would not be charged to my card until after installation was done and I was happy with the service, yet my card was charged the $49 before we even got off the phone. I then called dish to ask them why that was and they said well they didn't know what I was talking about that I went through a third party and that I would have to call them. What was weird is that I called the same number each and every time and yet they didn't know who I was talking to kind of Shady if you ask me. Never did get an answer on why I ended up paying the $49 or why it was charged to my card before installation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T20:06:29.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

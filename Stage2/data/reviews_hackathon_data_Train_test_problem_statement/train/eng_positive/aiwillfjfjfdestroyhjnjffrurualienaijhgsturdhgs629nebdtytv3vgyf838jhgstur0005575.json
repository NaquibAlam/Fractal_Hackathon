There were 26 of us travelling so I was quite concerned about booking restaurants and events before we went as we were such a large party!\nMy own background is in pubs, clubs & hospitality and I know how difficult it can be when large parties arrive without notice, fortunately I found 'The Spain Event Company', 'Aaron' & 'Souki' !\nAt first I was very dubious about using a company but all I can say is everything that was promised was delivered and MORE!\nAaron recommended and booked everything ahead of our trip and all went like a dream. We had booked a 'Tapas Tour' on the evening we arrived and we were very lucky to have the best possible guide 'Souki'.\nAaron arranged absolutely everything, meet n greet at the airport, coach transfers to and from our hotel ,tapas tour, I-pad tour, beer bikes and even a birthday cake ! Souki even arranged ballons for the restaurant on the evening of the birthday dinner.\nIf you have any reservations about using this company all I can say is don't, take Aarons advice and leave him to it.\nI had checked prices on everything previously and when I asked Aaron for a Quote: was pleasantly surprised, in actual fact it probably cost less than Â£10 per head more than if we had booked direct, this was worth every penny to ensure everything ran smoothly and have one point of contact while we stayed in Madrid.\nI will definitely use this company for future trips and recommend you do to!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T14:48:36.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

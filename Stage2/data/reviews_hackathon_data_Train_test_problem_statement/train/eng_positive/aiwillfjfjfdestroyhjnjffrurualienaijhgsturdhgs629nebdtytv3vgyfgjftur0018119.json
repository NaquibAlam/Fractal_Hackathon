I sent an image (photograph of the golf hole) which was then incorporated into the laminated plaque. Very nicely done--a quality product. I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for this sort of thing.\nI did, however, have a couple of issue. Both resolved very quickly with exceptionally friendly people.\nFirst, I tried to place the order online. But I kept getting an error message saying I needed to make a choice in a drop-down menu. I HAD made that choice, but it was not being recognized for some reason. A quick call and I placed the order directly. But it also alerted the company to a problem with their system. I was given a 10% discount for my troubles.\nThe second issue was that the golf ball would not stay seated in the hole in the plaque. I have another, similar plaque (from another company) and the ball was easily secured in place without problems. This led to 3-4 emails back/forth with their customer service folks. I tried all their suggestions but nothing ended up working. They seemed totally perplexed by the problem--said they had never experienced it before. Offered to replace the plaque, but I chose to try using some double-sided Scotch tape. Not an ideal solution, but it works. Regardless, I was very impressed with the quick and pleasant interactions with the company. They seemed willing to do anything to resolve the problem.\nAgain, I am very pleased with the plaque and would recommend the company without reservations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:24:05.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

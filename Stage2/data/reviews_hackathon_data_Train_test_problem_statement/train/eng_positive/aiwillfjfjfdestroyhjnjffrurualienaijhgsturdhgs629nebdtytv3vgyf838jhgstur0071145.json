Very satisfied with end result and appreciate that they reached out to me so quickly and resolved my frustrations.\nORIGINAL REVIEW: *Wrong item was sent and was expected to pay for return shipping and was not refunded for shipping costs either. So I paid $15.00 extra to recive and return the wrong item. Also tried to call them several times and was everytime put through to a voicemail.*", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T14:59:14.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I needed a lightweight buggy to get her to and from nursery and to get her our and about on my own. I am delighted with my purchase and highly recommend it!! The colours are fab, it is light, compact but also sturdy enough for every day use. Cannot fault this product and I also love the matching items (footmugg, changing bag etc).

It's a shame the US tries to resolve political issues halfway around the world and cannot seem to help make our relationship \"right\" for a country just 90 miles away.

HablaCuba has helped link families together and I am grateful for that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:42:04.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

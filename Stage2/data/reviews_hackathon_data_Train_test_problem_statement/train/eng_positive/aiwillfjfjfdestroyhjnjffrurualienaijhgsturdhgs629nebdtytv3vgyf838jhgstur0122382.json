One day I was reading a trade publication story about the benefits of CBDa from Endoca for pain. I decided to buy a couple of bottles to see if it would help her out.\nShe had walk with a cane and couldn't get up and down off the couch by herself. It was hard to get her to try some hemp-related because of the laws on THC, but I finally got her to try some. And I am very glad she did and so is she.\nShe came to visit on a Friday and by Sunday she could get up and down from the couch by herself and was able to begin walking without cane. I usually don't write articles or reviews, but CBDa made a huge amount of difference for my Mom. I would not have believed this story, but I saw it with own eyes.\nNo one was more amazed than her Doctor, who now recommends it to all of his patients who suffer from chronic pain. She was also able to quit taking all of her high blood pressure medicine. There is lots of CBDa research out there. Read up on it, discuss with your doctor, and give this stuff a try. You'll be very thankful that you did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T05:40:28.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A few days later it still didn't come, so I checked the tracking number on it and it said it was delivered. Well I had been home the day it was delivered and nothing came to my house. I emailed, and Andrew Swartz replied back to me pretty quickly. He was able to look into the situation and fix it, and I'll be getting my replacement box in the next couple of days. I have spoken with Andrew a time or 2 in the past in regulates with a question I may have had, and every time he is very nice and answers the questions or takes care of a problem if there may be one. I highly recommend LTB and their staff, because they stand behind their word in taking care of customers!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T03:17:32.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

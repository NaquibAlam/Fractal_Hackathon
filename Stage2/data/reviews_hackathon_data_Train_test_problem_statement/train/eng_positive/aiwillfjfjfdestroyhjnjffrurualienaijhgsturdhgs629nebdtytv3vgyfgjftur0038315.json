In the past I would pick up meals from the most convenient food places within the geography costing me valuable time out of the field, not to mention the car odor. Recently, while in a dr's office another rep was having lunch and told me about EZ caterer. That was one month ago and I have used them ever since with dozens of restaurant and catering options The biggest draw for me is ease of use. I don't want to spend time figuring out a \"new\" software and with eZ Cater I don't have to. EZ Caterer is so user friendly that I didn't have to read any of the how tos or watch any tutorial. Another feature is the receipt input into Concur for me so when I do expense reports I know longer have to scan meal receipts. Finally, another real bonus is the Amazon rewards option.

I was planning a trip to London with my family and was surprised by the high prices even though it was off-season. I had already given up hope when I came across the deals of AMOMA. First I thought it was too good to be true: A hotel I already wanted to book on another platform was Â£50 per night cheaper on AMOMA! I visited the site, could choose between different room types, found one for my small family and booked. I was still a bit sceptical but no need: got the hotel voucher directly per email and some weeks later we checked in to our hotel smoothly. The hotel itself was just lovely and more than worth the money we paid for it. Thanks AMOMA, you made our family getaway a lot cheaper!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:51:23.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We will be taking our two week trip in July 2017. I have been to CR previously but my mother has not. I wanted to go to all new, exotic, wildlife-filled destinations and provide my 76 yr old mother with the \"trip of a lifetime.\" Rachel's passion and knowledge for the country coupled with her familiarity of the choices for wide ranging accommodations were indispensable. Every detail was covered, taking the hassle out of planning tours and transfers. She was supportive and patient with the several alterations ( i.e changing resorts, tours, and adding a last night in San Jose) I requested over the course of a week before perfecting the itinerary. I am thrilled with the service I received in planning this special trip and, with all the positive reviews and my experience to date, have no doubt it will indeed prove to be an incredible and seamless \"trip of a lifetime.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:52:33.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

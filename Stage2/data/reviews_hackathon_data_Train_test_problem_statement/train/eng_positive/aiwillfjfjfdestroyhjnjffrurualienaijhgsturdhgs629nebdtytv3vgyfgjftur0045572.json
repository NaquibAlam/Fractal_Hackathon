NavePoint customer service was very helpful in communication updates with me. After waiting for FedEx for couple weeks, NavePoint refunded me the money so that I don't have to wait on FedEx to resolve my issue.\nI am extremely pleased with their customer service and will purchase from them again. I will also recommend them to my friends.\nKeep up the good work!\n-Mehul", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:52:07.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

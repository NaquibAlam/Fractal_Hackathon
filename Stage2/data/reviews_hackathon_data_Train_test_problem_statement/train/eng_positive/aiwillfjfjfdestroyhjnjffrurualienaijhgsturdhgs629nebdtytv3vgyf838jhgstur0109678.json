All flights we found online were expensive and with a long layover time. You helped us one that fits out schedule better.\nWE bought one - and in about half an hour you called back saying you found a better one, with exactly what we like.\nSo we ended up canceling the one we just bought half an hour prior and booked a much better one and cheaper. Thank you so much for everything you do. Your help is greatly appreciated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:34:20.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

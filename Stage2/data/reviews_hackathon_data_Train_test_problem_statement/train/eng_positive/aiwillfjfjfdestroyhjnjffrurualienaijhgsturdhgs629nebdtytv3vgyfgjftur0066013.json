I have ordered twice of \"buy 2 get 1 free\" and I am very, very pleased. Of the last three that arrived, two were too small for my head and CS was great and are sending two other different styles for a small charge. I love the Smooth Wave Bob, Sleek Bob, Soft Curls, and Curled Bob.\nI wish they were able to photograph different models in all the styles and colors; it would have made choosing a lot easier. I saw a short style listed under two different style names...confusing.\nOverall, I love these wigs. I lost a lot of hair from stress after several surgeries and I am fortunate to have found these wigs...and they are fun. From my experience, some of the shorter wigs seem to run smaller (and cause the scalp to be itchy) regardless of the adjustable tabs. Also, the styles shown that I have purchased look much better in person.

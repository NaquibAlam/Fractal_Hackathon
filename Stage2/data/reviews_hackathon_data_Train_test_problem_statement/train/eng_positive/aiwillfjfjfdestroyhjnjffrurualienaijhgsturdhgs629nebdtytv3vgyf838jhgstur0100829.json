The fact they allow people to charge whatever they want encourages scalping, and you can't always tell who is trying to fleece potential buyers and who is legit because Ticketmaster Resale add extra fees on top of whatever you want to sell your ticket for.\nThat being said, if you need to sell your tickets quickly, the service is decent. Money is transferred to your account only days after the concert or event. It's a shame that scalpers take advantage of this service, because it is a good way to legitimately sell unwanted tickets safely and reliably, as long as you are not a scummy scalper.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:02:49.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

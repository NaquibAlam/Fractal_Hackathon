Very helpful and knowledgeable. She made me feel comfortable. I have her her number and extension to call back on Monday for her to assist me. I could not start my car today....who knows why...so I was not able to access my vehicle after about twenty attempts. At this point a friend came and gave me a ride , so my car was not accessible to meOtherwise she offered to have me go to my car and troubleshoot. I thank her and hope you value her as an employee.\nThe people at the Charleston, WV location are not only uncaring. They are rude and abrupt. NO help at all.\nGail Flint\n07/17/1960", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T18:57:38.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

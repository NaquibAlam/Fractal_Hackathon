Its so economical and simple to use. My 75 year old grandma uses it regularly and 5 dollars will last her a good 6 months (she averages 30 minute calls about 4-5 times a week. I know because Habla Mexico keeps track!) Pinless dialing is so convenient and you can even set up speed dial on your online account. I love love love love Habla Mexico! I can't imagine why anyone would use anything else :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:08:05.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

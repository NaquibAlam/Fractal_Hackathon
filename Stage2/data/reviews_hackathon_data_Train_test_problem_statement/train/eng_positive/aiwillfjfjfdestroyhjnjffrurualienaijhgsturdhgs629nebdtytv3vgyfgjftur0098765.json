I also requested that CUBE provide a useful form of compensation for their error and Robert worked it out so I received a Bosch quick charger for my trouble.\nAll-in-all, although being kept off my new bike while things got sorted out, my experience with MHW has been a really positive one, and I was so thankful for the superior customer service I received. When thanking Robert for all his help, his response was: \"No thanks is necessary - that's service!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:25:26.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I've really enjoyed all the meals and they've been super easy to make. My only problem is that out of my four shipments only one has arrived on Monday like it's scheduled to. Granted, we had some bad weather the first week, I guess UPS was still catching up the second, I received my third on time and now my fourth will arrive on Wednesday, two days late again. This isn't really a HelloFresh thing but it is their responsibility to demand that UPS get their stuff together. I don't know what UPS's excuse is for the lateness of this package but it really throws a wrench in things since I'm using this service for weeknight meals and getting it halfway through the week so I cannot start cooking until Thursday night doesn't do me much good. The first time I reached out to HelloFresh they gave me a measly $10 off (that never came) then the second time I reached out they credited me a box plus the missing $10 credit so I feel that they made it right for me. We'll see how next delivery goes but I can say I won't continue to use this service if I can't get my shipments on time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:30:05.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

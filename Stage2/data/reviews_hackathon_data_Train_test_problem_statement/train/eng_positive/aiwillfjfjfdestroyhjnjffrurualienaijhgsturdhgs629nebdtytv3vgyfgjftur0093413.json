He listened and took time to answer my questions and heard my concerns. He did not act as if my inquiries were annoying or that he didn't have time. He asked questions about my purchase and offered me options. He also used a very pleasant and welcoming tone. The delivery team followed up as Kyle said they would and showed up during the delivery time Quote: d. They put my item together and organized it instead of leaving it sprawled across the floor. I wasn't home at the time. It felt good to arrive home and see they put thought into how to leave my apartment and the new addition. Especially when the new addition didn't exactly fit into the space I envisioned for it.\nGreat service from beginning to end.\nThanks Kyle! Thanks Igor and delivery team!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T19:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T23:26:30.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

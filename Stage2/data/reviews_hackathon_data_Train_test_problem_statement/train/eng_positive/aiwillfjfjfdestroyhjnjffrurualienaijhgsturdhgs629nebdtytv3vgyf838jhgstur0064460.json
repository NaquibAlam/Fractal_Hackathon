I am so happy I did. Joe and Jeff in Sales, Dan in Service and Jim have gone above and beyond to help me out every time I go for a torque check or a tire rotation. They are always professional and courteous. I never have to worry about the safety of my tires. Every time I go in I always receive service with a friendly smile. I am very grateful to these gentlemen as well as the entire staff at Town Fair Tire. I appreciate the fine service and professionalism here. Definately telling other friends about my experience so the next time they need tires this is the place to go. Thanks again Town Fair Tire!

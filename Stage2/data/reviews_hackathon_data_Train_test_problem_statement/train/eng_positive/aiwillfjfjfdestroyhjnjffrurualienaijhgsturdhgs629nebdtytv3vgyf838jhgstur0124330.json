If you've ordered HON keys before, you know there are many number and letter options. My original key just had \"128\". So when the keys arrived with \"128E\" on them, I assumed they were wrong. However, they worked perfectly - don't know what the \"E\" was for, but luckily these folks know what they're doing. Very promptly mailed.

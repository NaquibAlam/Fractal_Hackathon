I went in and began purchasing two gallons at a time. After several months of drinking the water and reading about all the benefits of an alkaline system, I decided to research the market for purchasing a machine for my home.\nI began to research the top three companies. In my final analysis, it was an easy choice. The Life Ionizer, was ahead of the other in technology, options, maintenance, warranty and the units had a sleek appearance.\nThe company was friendly, patiently answered all my questions and were there to assist.\nYou cannot put a price on your health; it is #1. I feel I paid a fair price and am extremely glad I made this investment. This is the only water I drink.\nKristina Larsen\nOwner/Principal Broker\nLuxury Homes Int'l.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:35:06.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

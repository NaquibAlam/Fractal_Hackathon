The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five is because I joined the puzzle of the month club for myself for one year but got a letter stating that I had been enrolled in the club for six months. If I had bought this for someone else, they would not know that there was an error in the letter and I had bought the club for a full year. When I got that letter I immediately went online, tried to chat with customer service but no one was available so I sent a written message about the error in the letter. I never received a reply. I understand that a written letter is a kind attempt to deliver great customer service as well as the request to submit a review and that the error was a simple, careless oversight. But even so, it could have been avoided or addressed promptly. So that's why there's a four-star rating instead of five. But I do enjoy the product, will recommend the company to my puzzling friends, and look forward to receiving more puzzles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T16:42:22.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

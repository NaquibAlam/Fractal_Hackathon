I've been ordering from them for 3 months now and it has been fantastic. The orders always come on time if not, early! The food is very carefully made up to suit my dogs needs who is very picky. And my dog loves the taste of the food and cannot wait for his meals now. Also my dog had a very loose bowel before I tried tails which was awful to clear up, however after using tails.com it had been very solid. Also the price per month is very reasonable. Can't praise tails.com enough, I'm never giving my dog anything else!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:28:01.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

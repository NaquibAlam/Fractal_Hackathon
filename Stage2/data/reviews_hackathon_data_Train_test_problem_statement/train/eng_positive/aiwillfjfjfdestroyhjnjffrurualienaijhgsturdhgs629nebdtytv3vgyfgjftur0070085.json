I had reached out to two other companies to help with my account being suspended on Amazon. One company sent me one email and i never heard from them again, costing me three days of having my account down waiting for them to help. The other company said my case was tricky and they could not be sure of getting me back up.\nWhen I contacted amazonappeal.com they were right on it, calling me on the phone with no uncertainties of getting me back up and active on Amazon. I submitted the appeal letter they gave me Mon night and was back up before noon the next day. I was so happy to have a helpful person who was in really good communication with me on this. I already recommended them to a friend and will highly recommend to them others who have this problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:21:24.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

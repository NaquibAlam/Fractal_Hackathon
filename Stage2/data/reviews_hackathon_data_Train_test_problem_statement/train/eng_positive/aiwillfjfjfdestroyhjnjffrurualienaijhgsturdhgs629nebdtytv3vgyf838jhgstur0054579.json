I purchased a Tractive for my Husky a month ago following the tragic death of my beautiful and much loved Irish Red Setter Molly who was knocked down by a car after getting out of the house by accident. The accident happened within 5 minutes of her escaping during which time we were driving frantically round the roads near our home trying to find her. If only she had been wearing a tracker perhaps we might have found her in time.\nRegarding the Tractive, this device is not perfect. Battery life is short and I would advise from my own experience that you charge it every night without fail. It will not run for two days without charging!\nLive tracking can also be hit and miss depending on where you live and whether you have good mobile coverage. That said I have tested it and have been able to pick up signal along the route enough to take to take me to it reasonably quickly. I advise sharing the app with 1-2 family members as I have also been testing having them direct me to the tracker location when they are in an area of good mobile reception when I am not. You just need to remember that the more people that share the app, the quicker the battery will run down. In summary, I go to work more content now knowing that my remaining dog is wearing a tracker and I can check on his whereabouts several times during the day. I would recommend this tracker to any/all dog owners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:55:34.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

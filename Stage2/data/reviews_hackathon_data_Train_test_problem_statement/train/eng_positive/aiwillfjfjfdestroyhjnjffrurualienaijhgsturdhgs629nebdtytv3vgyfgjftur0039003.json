I'm only five days post procedure but I can honestly say he was the right Dr. for the job. Prior to my procedure (FUT) I had consultations with three other Drs. I felt they were all very educated and well known in the field but I felt a true connection with Dr. Huebner. I watched several of his youtube videos and viewed his website multiple times. It was important to me to find a provider who was familiar with African American hair which he definitely is. When I heard him use the term \"edges\" I knew he was the chosen one LOL. I highly recommend Dr. Huebner!!! His team was just as wonderful as he was, they made me feel so comfortable the day of the procedure and Jerry has been so helpful with staying in contact and answering my calls/text/emails.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:04:49.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

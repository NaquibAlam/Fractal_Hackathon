We had an experienced driver / tour guide (David Costello) all to ourselves in a comfortable mini-van. He was extremely knowledgeable and always had some alternatives up his sleeve in case of foul weather. Sheenco arranged accommodations in three different castles and my daughters are still talking about what a fairy tale vacation they had. Thank you Sheenco for helping me make a special memory with my daughters - not easy to do with teenagers!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:48:37.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I put their customer service on par or better than Amazon. And i am a HUGE fan of Amazon, i dont say this lightly. Excellent hire of Lauren Alfonzo! She was an excellent representative of your company. She seemed to put herself in the shoes of the customer, expecting just what a customer would expect. I had my replacement product sent to my work, at my request. I showed off what is an excellent product, and i sang the praises of your site to over 100 people. Not sure if this will equate in an uptick in your sales, but if any of them are considering a sports purchase, i am confident they will visit your site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T18:30:05.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

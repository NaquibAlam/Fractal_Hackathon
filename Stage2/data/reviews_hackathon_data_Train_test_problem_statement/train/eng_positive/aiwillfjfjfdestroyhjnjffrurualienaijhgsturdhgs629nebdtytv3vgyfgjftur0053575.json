Sale items go fast so when you get your email, get online immediately. The descriptions are good and I used the reviews to help me in my selection. I feel very confident when I make my purchases. It's nice to not have to go into a store (drive there, park, go in and walk all around, bring coupons that don't ever apply to sportswear and run out - I never try anything on there - don't have time so, if something does not fit, then return it and the process takes even longer). This is the only way to shop for athletic and sportswear in my opinion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:16:46.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

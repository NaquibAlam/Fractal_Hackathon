I'm not a computer expert but was able to complete the application & download my photo with no problem. They quickly got back to me via email to let me know my order had been received and then contacted me a second time to request a different photo as the one I'd submitted was not complient for a US passport. After I submitted a new photo I received another email, \"Great photo!\" Nice that they took the time to let me know. Definitely a great way to get passport photos done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T22:28:16.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

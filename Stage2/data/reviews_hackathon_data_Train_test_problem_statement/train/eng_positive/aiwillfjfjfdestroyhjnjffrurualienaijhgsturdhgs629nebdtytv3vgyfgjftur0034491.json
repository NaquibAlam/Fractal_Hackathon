Some bugs have been found in the set up phase but with a little patience OOS support is forthcoming and resolution achieved. Some app functionality is still in development which is a little disappointing. However, OOS efforts appear genuine with the driving interest being company growth and value adding both new and existing client platforms. I believe OOS are a driven company interested in developing existing products and supporting clients to achieve success. Patience and effective communication skills by both OOS and the client will be key to overcoming any obstacles encountered after initial purchase and set up. I hope to see OOS continue to maintain a solid commitment in working with all clients.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T18:48:09.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

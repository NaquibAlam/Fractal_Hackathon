It was convenient to be able to logout and come back when I had time. There was one unit quiz I didn't get 80% on so it let me re-take it. I also found it helpful that at the end of each quiz there was an explanation for the questions you answered incorrectly. The only problem I had was during the final exam. Throughout the entire course the statistics focused on 2011, but during the final there were at least 2 questions that asked about statistics from 2009. I took pretty specific notes and couldn't find these statistics. I'm not sure if it was a mistake and hadn't been updated yet, or if they were trick questions. Altogether the course was helpful and easy enough to pass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T23:03:39.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

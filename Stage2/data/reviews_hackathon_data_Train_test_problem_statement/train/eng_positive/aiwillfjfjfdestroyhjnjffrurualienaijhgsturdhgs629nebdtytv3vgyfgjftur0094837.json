The service and selection are exceptional, and the products excellent. OOL helpfully labels product with the harvest date which is almost always missing from store bought product in the US. The website provides excellent and accurate product information and the variety is good. Recently I gave the Olio Quattrociocchi Truffle Aroma a try with outstanding results. The flavor is superb. About the only negative is that they do not offer any Croatian oil, a personal favorite!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T19:49:27.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

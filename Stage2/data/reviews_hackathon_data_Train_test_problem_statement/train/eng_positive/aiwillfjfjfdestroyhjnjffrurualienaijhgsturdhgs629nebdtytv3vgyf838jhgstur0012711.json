I am normally a size medium in shirts/dresses and a size 4 in jeans. After putting in my measurements, it said that I needed an XL. I read some reviews saying that the sizing guide is way off, so I chose to get a medium instead. It came in and I definitely should have ordered a small because it is entirely too large. However, it is a beautiful dress and is nothing a bit of altering can't fix. It's a great place to find a dress, just go with what sizes you normally get or even a smaller size.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:44:22.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

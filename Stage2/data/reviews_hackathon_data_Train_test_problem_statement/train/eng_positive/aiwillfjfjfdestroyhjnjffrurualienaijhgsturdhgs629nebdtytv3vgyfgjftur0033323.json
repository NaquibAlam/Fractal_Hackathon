I read a ton lately! Whenever I find books I want to read, instead of spending $10-$40 on books I can spend a few bucks or less than $20!

Plus it gets me reading even more :) thanks", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:35:13.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

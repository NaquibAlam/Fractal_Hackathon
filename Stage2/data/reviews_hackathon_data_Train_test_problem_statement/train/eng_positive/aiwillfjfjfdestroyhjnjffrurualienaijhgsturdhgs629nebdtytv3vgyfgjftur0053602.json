It's basically a buy here pay here just like their competition a few miles away. They do have a lot of extras that they do put in the final paperwork as far as GPS, warranty and Gap insurance which adds on to the price of the vehicle but we are that percentage of the population that does not have the best credit so they feed off of us. The experience that I had was a good one as far as buying a car goes. They showed me how to work all the bells & whistles that came with the car and made sure everything worked. The only thing that bothered me was that they did not detail (wash) the car before they gave me the keys.

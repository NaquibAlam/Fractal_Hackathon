I have emailed questions-(as I am a novice collector) And do not know about values of coins-PCGS versus NGC, signed coins, etc.\nLarry took the time awhile back to call me and suffer a fool and my MANY questions-always with patience and explained the minute details about coins, values, what to avoid, etc.\nFrom that point on, I call Larry and/or Larry will call me about new coins-or regarding info on hard to find coins and advice on coins coming out in the future, etc.\nI could not be happier with Coin Adviser, or with Larry-and other reps there, for all of my PSGS coins. I only buy and collect the best-70 coins extant- and of course they are more expensive than other types and grades.\nDo yourself a favor and give them a call and work with Larry or one of the other quality reps there.\nScott Reeves", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T18:47:44.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

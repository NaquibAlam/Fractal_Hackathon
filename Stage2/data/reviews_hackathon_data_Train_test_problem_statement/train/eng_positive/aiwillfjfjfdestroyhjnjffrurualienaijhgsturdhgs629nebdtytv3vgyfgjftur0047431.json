I had a custom made mat and requested grommets all around the perimeter. They sent me a mat where they missed one section. They asked me to send them pictures of the mat, which I did, which showed they missed a spot. After that, they sent me another custom mat, but everything was done perfectly! The second mat was free - no charge. What an awesome company that stands behind their product and their customer service was top notch. Both mats are excellent and despite the lack of grommets on section, even the defect one is very well made. These are made in the USA and not some cheap garbage from China. I'm proud to own it and proud to keep my money right here employing middle class hard working people in the USA!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:56:22.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

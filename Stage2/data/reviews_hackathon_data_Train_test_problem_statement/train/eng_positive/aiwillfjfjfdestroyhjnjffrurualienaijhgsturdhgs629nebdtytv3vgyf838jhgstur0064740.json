We used a partner implementer and whilst we couldn't have done it by ourselves some things did slip through the cracks and our data was nowhere near up to scratch causing about 2 months of hell while we straightened things out.\nTo give a background we buy and sell Workwear/PPE and Site Safety products to accounts but also have a retail shop and wanted to expand our online offering. We had been using MYOB Retail Manager, had only manual/physical stock control and a clunky website that generated very little in the way of online sales.\nAfter exhaustive research we found that Cin7 was the only solution that catered to our needs without going the whole hog with an ERP solution like Jim2 or NetSuite which we found to be outdated and over complex. (Very few solutions could cope with accounts, POS and B2B Online without some clunky add-on)\nSome of the reasons we chose to go with Cin7:\n• Cloud based\n• Catered to clothing sizes/colours\n• B2B Accounts and POS\n• Integrated B2B site\n• Modern Look and Feel\n• Smart buyer (function of Cin7 which automatically works out what needs to be ordered or stock or sales orders)\n• Scalable (add additional users and when required new location(s))\n9 Months on and it is still a work in progress but we are already reaping the benefits of stock visibility, order traceability through the whole dispatch process and the Xero link is giving us much more accurate and up to date accounts than we have ever had.\nThere is a few bugbears and things that we knew before we started but chose to put up with:\n• This is an inventory management system not an ERP so the CRM doesn’t really fulfil our requirements (we have integrated with Exsalerate to overcome this but have only had limited success)\n• There are occasional bugs with the system and everything jams. Though these are usually resolved within 3-5min it is a bit interesting when you have a customer in front of you waiting for a delivery docket to sign.\n• The Smart Buyer function doesn’t really work for clothing which frustrating as it very powerful tool for purchasing and can potentially cut hours of work.\n• The B2B site isn’t an E-commerce solution (they integrate with various E-commerce solutions)\nSo overall I would recommend Cin7 but just make sure you know its limitations before you take the plunge and plan for these, they integrate with a plethora of other solutions but be aware that these won’t necessarily work as seamlessly as a full ERP. At the end of the day Cin7 came about as an inventory management system/solution for Xero and that's what it does best.\nA Few Tips...\n• Make sure you have your product & stock data ready before you try to implement or risk a heart attack\n• The free trial is an excellent way to get a feel for the system followed up by a GTM with one of the PPL at Cin7.\n• Make sure you internet speed is fast enough or be prepared to wait", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:22:28.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

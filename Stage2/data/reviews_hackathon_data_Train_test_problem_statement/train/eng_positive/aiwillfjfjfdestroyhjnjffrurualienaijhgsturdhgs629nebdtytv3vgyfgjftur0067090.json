It had a gap between the two doors...the builder had stuck to single doors together and water leaked through the gap to the framing. Luckily there was just one layer of rot, which Homeadvisor's repairman replaced with treated wood. The more daunting task was fitting the new door into the same frame. He provided measurements to the door manufacturer and they sent us a new door that fit perfectly. He installed the door, caulked everything, and replaced original trim, which he had carefully removed, inside and out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T21:02:43.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

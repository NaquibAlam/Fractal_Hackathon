Payment was easy. Recieved confirmation mail straight away and printable voucher.\nPick up at Perth Airport was a breeze and I even added a navigation system. Thrifty was helpful with maps and directions. The car was exactly as ordered. Clean and fueled up, ready to go.\nI gave the wrong time for drop off and realized the night before that my flight was an early morning one and I found contacting them about drop off wascquick and easy.\nWill certainly use thier services again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T09:30:26.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

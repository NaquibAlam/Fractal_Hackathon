Long distance regrets for this foolish artist but thankfully we purchased through Artfinder and Emily and her staff made things totally right. No costs to us full refund and shipping back to the UK. Sad we liked the piece but the Artist well....We will always recommend Artfinder as you as a purchaser can feel confident that you have a great Broker on your side! Well done see you soon.

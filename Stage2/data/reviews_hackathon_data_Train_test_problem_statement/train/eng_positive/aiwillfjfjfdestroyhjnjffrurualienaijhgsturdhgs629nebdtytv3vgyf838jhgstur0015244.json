I love the program offered to my daughter is so easy to use and the classes are God centered. She is learning at her own pace. She is actually learning more than in public school, getting better grades and thoroughly enjoying school work. The teachers are wonderful, quick to respond and are very encouraging. It truly has been a blessing for my family. My daughter is so encouraged and I believe that It is well worth the money.\nThis is a great school and I highly recommend it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T11:27:09.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

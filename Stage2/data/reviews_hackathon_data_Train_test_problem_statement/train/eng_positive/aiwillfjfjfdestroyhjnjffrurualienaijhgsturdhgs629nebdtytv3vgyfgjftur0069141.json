The customer service was great, Shane was very helpful and polite. I did not know if I wanted to purchase from an online company, but I did a lot of research to check the validity of the company. There are some good sources if you just take the time to look around. The company is in good standing with the BBB and there were enough reviews and videos to convince me that B2C is a legitimate company. I had no issues once the order process started and it was a fast turn around time. They called to let me know that it would be shipped over night and it arrived the next afternoon which I live in Texas and it came from New York so I was happy. I was impressed with the diamond ring once I got it in, the quality is great and the box it came in was a nice touch as well. Thanks again to Shane and B2C Jewels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T18:19:57.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

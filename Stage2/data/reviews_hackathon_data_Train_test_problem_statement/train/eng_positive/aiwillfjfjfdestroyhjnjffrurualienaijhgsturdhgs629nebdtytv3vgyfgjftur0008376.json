If your flght gets in after business hours your car (with docs) will be waiting for you in the airport carpark, so do go through their confirmation notice to understand how to find it. You will also have to pay the parking charge when exiting the carpark, and this cost is not included in Omega's charges. Ours was $19 for an 8pm collection, so no big deal over a week.\nAdding an extra driver was just a matter of popping into their office in town & all done in 2 minutes.\nNice car (we had the 2013 Corolla hatch), clean, much bigger than I expected (huge amount of rear legroom, so perfect for 4 adults).\nHighly recommended!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:40:00.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

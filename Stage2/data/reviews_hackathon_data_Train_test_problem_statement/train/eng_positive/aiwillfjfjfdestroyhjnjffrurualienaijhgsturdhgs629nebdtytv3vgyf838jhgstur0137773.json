They have an office right around the corner from my house and I have been using them for about ten years now to get my concert tickets. You used to have to go to the office to pick up your tickets but with their new downloadable tickets, I had absolutely no issue at all with getting into the event I wanted to go to.\nI don't even have the gmail app on my iPhone so I just went to my gmail account through Safari and they downloaded right away. However, the guys who scanned my ticket said that the downloads were not working on any other devices other than iPhones. Luckily, I have an iPhone and did not have to panic trying to get into the concert I was going to.\nI love the new technology of using the downloadable tickets and I am always more likely to use a company who does downloadable tickets versus printing because I am the type of person who ALWAYS leaves my printed tickets at home and has to turn around to go get them at home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:35:12.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A huge thank you to them for relocating me from one park near Mollina to another, after I unfortunately purchased a mobile home from a UK based company who promised paradise but instead I found myself in hell. The company's rep's gave me totally wrong information, miss-sold a home to me stating it was double glazed, which it wasn't, the contract was incorrect as was the ground rent figures and once I arrived on the park I had to part with more money for fee's which I wasn't told about, so to say the least I was not happy. On contacting the rep's they and informing them of their errors they passed me on to their head office in UK, they acknowledged the info was incorrect caused by the rep's not checking the facts, I asked for a full refund but that was not forthcoming, after 1 week I spoke to the owner of the park, explained that I understood that even though he owned the mobile, the fault lay with the company selling it, he told me to \" stop whining\" and he threatened to kick me off the park for making a nuisance of myself, from there everything went rapidly downhill, the park owner verbally abused, harassed and intimidated me and on one occasion stalked me but as I was living under the threat of eviction I could do nothing. The UK based company offered to resell the home free of charge, on the third scheduled viewing I waited on a nieghbour's veranda for over 4 hours, the rep's didn't turn up and didn't inform me.\nI contacted William from CARAVANS IN THE SUN, explained the whole sorry saga to him, he introduced me to Eric, who collected me , took me to another park outside Mollina, showed me a home which had everything my previous home had AND was fully double glazed, we made a deal where we did a swap, they took my home off the other park, paid all the expenses and a full year's rent as well.I am now settled in my new home, delighted and can't thank CARAVANS IN THE SUN enough, I am so happy to be in a park with a company who treats people with respect and who are honest and trustworthy, it's a pleasure to recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T23:34:11.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Not sure that's a probikekit problem but if they knew when a shipment advertised as \"free shipping\" would incur customs charges if they could alert us customers so it wouldn't be a negative surprise that would be amazing. I love receiving my orders but the elation is muted when they say \"but you owe $50 before we can release this to you.\" Again, not PBK's fault but something to be aware of perhaps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:02:50.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

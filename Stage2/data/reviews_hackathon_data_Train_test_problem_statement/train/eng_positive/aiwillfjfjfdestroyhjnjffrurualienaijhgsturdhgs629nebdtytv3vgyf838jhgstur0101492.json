It worked out perfectly as the shoes I ordered ran big so I ended up sizing down and keeping the smaller pair. The return process was super easy and I was shocked the return was processed within a day of sending it back! So awesome.\nAdditionally, I love that SSENSE is Canadian and will definitely be purchasing from them again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T07:57:40.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

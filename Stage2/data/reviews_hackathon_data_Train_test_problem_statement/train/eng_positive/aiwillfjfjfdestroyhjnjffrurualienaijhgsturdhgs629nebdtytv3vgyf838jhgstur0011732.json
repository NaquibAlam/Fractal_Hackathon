The only thing barring them getting a 5 star review is their choice of courier - Toll - which had great difficulty following delivery instructions.\nThe product is excellent. Exactly as described, and adequate to my needs. The spin lock system is different to what I'm used to, but works quite well, and secures better than I expected. The plates are a high quality, and after weighing approx 6 of the plates appear to be well calibrated (+/- 20g for the 5kg plates, no deviation for smaller).\nThe delivery came in 2 stages, the first I was home to receive the consignment and signed for it without issue. The second (2 days later) I was not home, and they were not able to be located around my premise. Toll have insisted delivery instructions were followed, however the package was not able to be located around the back of my property as instructed, and there was no evidence to suggest attempted access.\nGym Direct were more than professional in managing this situation. They initially requested proof of delivery from Toll, who were not able to supply adequate proof in the form of photograph of delivery state, and then organised for replacement items to be shipped.\nThis was attended quite rapidly, and I received them today. The customer service I experienced was exemplary, and is to be commended.\nThe package received today was unfortunately left on my front door, in full view of street and likely in the same manner the original missing consignment was. Despite this, the items were received. While I hope the feedback regarding their courier choice is taken on board - I still absolutely recommend ordering through Gym Direct. It remains a high quality product, as described, with a high weight tolerance and a very competitive price. Hold them in high regard when considering gym equipment suppliers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T21:30:12.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

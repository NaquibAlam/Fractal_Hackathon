Their lawns had no grass, dirty hallways, some property not cleaned up at all. The four properties I viewed before picking my next home, every one of them were clean or only few here and there fix up. Even the one on 62nd and King Drive. Surrounding area was bad, but the property was clean. Pangea takes good care of their properties. I am hoping I will never have to update this after moving in. Thank you, Magnolia for helping me find my new home!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:55:23.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I had no idea what to do, thought I lost all my work, I Googled for help as my Sage Software tech support was closed on a Sunday night.. I found Experthelp as they also help with the Sage Software program to. I immediately entered my info, and received a FAST reply. I was surprised just how fast was the service, I received an email from a young man named Byron, right away he knew exactly what was my computer problem, he log-into my computer and fixed the problem immediately, the problem was actually a windows problem and not a sage problem. Very impressive, I asked to speak with him also on the phone and he was very sharp, he knew exactly what to do, it was all fixed in no time. Not only is Experthelp Fast an reliable, they are honest and fair, I clicked twice on the phone number contact and they refunded me back my money that I had overpaid. I personally would highly recommend their services to others, as they are true and very reliable, a 5 star rating for EXCELLENT service, THANK YOU, Yiota", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T12:05:46.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

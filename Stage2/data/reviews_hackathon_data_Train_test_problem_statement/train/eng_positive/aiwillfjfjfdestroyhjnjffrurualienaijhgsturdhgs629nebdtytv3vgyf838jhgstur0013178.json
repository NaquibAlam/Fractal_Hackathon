The car had a lot of scratches, dents, and dings before we picked it up, and we were happy that Omega did not try to blame us for any of them when we returned the car. However, the electronic key pad that unlocks the car did not work, there was no cruise control even though the car was newer, and I had some communication issues with customer service. I made a couple bookings with Omega at one time and they misprinted a time of pick up for one of the bookings on my confirmation receipt. When I asked to have it changed (according to the time listed on my original online booking) they changed the time of the 2nd booking. It took about 5 emails over the course of four days (due to the time change) to get it all straightened out. Other than these small issues, it was a good experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:06:13.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

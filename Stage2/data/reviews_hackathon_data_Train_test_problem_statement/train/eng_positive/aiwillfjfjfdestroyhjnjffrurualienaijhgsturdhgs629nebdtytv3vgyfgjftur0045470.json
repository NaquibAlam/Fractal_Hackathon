I bought 25 of the large mats 1m x 1m, for my garage. I liked them so much that I bought 5 more.\nThey provide good cushioning and seem very durable. They are a little more firm than expected and I would not recommend them for throws, but for training in jiu jitsu other than that they work very well.\nAlso, be aware that the surface is a little more slick than typical mats you would find at your academy. Overall, I would say that the firmness and the slickness make them somewhat less favorable than the higher end mats at the gym, but for the price and for home use they are probably the best way to go. They are a very good value and you can tell it is a product that will really hold up well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:56:18.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

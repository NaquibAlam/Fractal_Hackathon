The only thing is that I should have ordered the prints smaller. For example an 18 x 24 print fits in the bag just fine, but the print had a 1/2 inch white boarder around it which I had to cut off to fit them in the bag. I should have ordered the prints 17 x 23! Then I wouldn't have had to cut that boarder off.

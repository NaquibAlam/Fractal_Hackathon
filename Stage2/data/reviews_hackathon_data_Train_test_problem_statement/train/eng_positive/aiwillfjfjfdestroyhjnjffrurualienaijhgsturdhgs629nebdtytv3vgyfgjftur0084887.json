After reading and looking at all of the reviews I decided to take the plunge. However, finding them on line at a decent price and in the right size proved a little more tricky. However, using the online search I found the Snowcountry website stocked them at a very good price with a large range of bindings. I initially asked about delivery to the channel Island and got a response back the next morning. I placed an order for some 188's and Black Tyrolia bindings on a Monday evening. I received a call the following day to advise that they did not have black bindings available and unsure of when they would receive them. I was offered the black and white set of the same model and an offer of a ski bag to help with not having the correct bindings available. We had a quick discussion and I accepted the offer and they proceeded with putting the package together (mounting the bindings) and dispatching the parcel. Because they used UPS the parcel arrived 2 days later and I had it released through customs the same evening. The skis were delivered to my chosen point which meant that only 3.5 days after ordering them I had them in my possession. I call that excellent service and thank Snowcountry for taking time to have a chat on the call where we discussed setting for bindings based on my weight and ability. Can't wait to use them in March. I would thoroughly recommend Snowcountry to anyone who is looking for ski equipment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:54:28.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

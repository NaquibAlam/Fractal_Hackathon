I went to searching the internet for a company that expedited passports and found RUSHMYPASSPORT. I contact the customer service department to get the details and started the process of getting my kids passports. I sent the paperwork off with the required documents via Fed-Ex and my personal courier Merciline Ofelin made the magic happen. I want to extend out a special thanks to Merciline because I feel like I had a close friend working on the other end of the passport process where I couldn't be. I am beyond impressed with Rush my Passport and my courier Merciline Ofelin and would recommend them to anyone who needs a passport expedited asap!!! Thank you!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T21:23:55.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

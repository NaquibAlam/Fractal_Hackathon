Our itinerary was tailor made and fitted our requirement perfectly. We had knowledgeable, friendly and professional Egyptologist guides the whole way through (Hala Kamel for Giza and Cairo and Mohammed Saad for Aswan and Luxor) who answered all our questions with alacrity. We felt safe and looked after the whole way through.\nWhat was particularly impressive was our guides willingness to go above and beyond. My mum was injured during our trip and our guide sorted out the required hospital and medical care very smoothly. Needless to say, it was difficult to say farewell to the guides we grew so close to.\nI would highly recommend booking with Osiris!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T04:56:57.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

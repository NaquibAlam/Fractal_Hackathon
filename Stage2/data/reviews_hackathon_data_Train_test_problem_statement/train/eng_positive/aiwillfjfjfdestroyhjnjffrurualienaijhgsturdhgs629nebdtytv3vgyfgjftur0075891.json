The girl from the office rang me and explained what had happened, she asked what I needed it for, I explain what my dress was like etc, she offered to go down on the floor and see if she could find something that may work instead. She rang me back with her selection and said if I was not happy with it there was free returns. I got her selection on Friday and to be honest it works way better with my dress then what I had picked.

As a single traveller, the companionship of a well - trained local guide and small group have been invaluable in enhancing my travel experience. The opportunity to share a room is also a useful option for single travellers. Intrepid specializes in cultural experiences with the locals, which is a very enriching addition to the tour and gives an opportunity to learn about their culture first-hand. This also gives an income to local communities who benefit as well as the tourists. The Intrepid tour guides have been great: friendly, knowledgeable and patient in helping with any problems. The staff at the Melbourne headquarters are also fantastic to deal with and very efficient. I have no hesitation in recommending Intrepid Travel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T17:31:50.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We wanted to see our statue, sit outdoors on nice evenings and keep away raccoons which seem to love our yard. All worked well. We WILL be having them come back to do more work for our front yard as soon as the season starts in 2017.\nThe timer works well too.\nWe absolutely love our yard. Too bad I did not do it when we had our kids living at home. Oh well, now we have it for our adult kids, and grand children and friends --- and us!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T12:30:07.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

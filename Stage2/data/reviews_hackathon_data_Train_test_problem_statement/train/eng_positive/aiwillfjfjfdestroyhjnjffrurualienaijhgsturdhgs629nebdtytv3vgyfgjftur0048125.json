They do great with giving discounts and promos so I usually wait for a steal of a deal and use my credit then. When shipping was delayed they gave me -$10 off and for my birthday an additional 10% off. You can earn rewards for reviewing the products for free items as well. The quality of the clothes is what kept me coming, you can feel its not cheap! I get soo many compliments, i use the clothes for everyday use and workout wear, even comfy enough to sleep in, when i get too lazy to change :) They have very unique options to select from that keep me interested month after month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:21:05.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have used OPEN EUROPE for many trips and now using AUTO EUROPE for an upcoming trip. I was very pleased to speak with Lance in booking our car for our July/August Trip. He went over and above in helping me to get the car I need as the price I was willing to pay. I am a retired business owner and I made it a point that when I receive the quality of service in a friendly and efficient manner, I make sure that the powers that be take note and encourage those employees who represent your company in such a wonderful way. Lance and Elijah are two individuals that do that... and I thank YOU for having them on your staff. Looking forward to this trip and to future business with AUTO EUROPE ... Keep up the good work .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:45:02.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

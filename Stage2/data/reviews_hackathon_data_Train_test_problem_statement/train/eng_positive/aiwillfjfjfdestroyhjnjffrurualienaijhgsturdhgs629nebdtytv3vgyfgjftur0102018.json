There are worse things then being in demand, for the right reason. The soups are outstanding and that is the reason for ordering from these guys. On top of that, they understood the mess of being swamped with high volumes before the holiday, but they didn't make excuses and just started getting deliveries out. I decided to wait, felt my original decision to order was well founded...and I'm not at all disappointed. Lesson learned...see if you can go on Fox earlier in December to predict holiday demand...and the rest of us can just order earlier. All good...glass is more than 1/2 full...god bless America!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T23:09:14.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I hadn't heard of them before and was a bit dubious about trying them, however I'm glad I did. I found a PS4 game I wanted and for only Â£4.85 and that included postage. I was still wary, wondering if the order would take an age or if the game would be used. I was proven wrong on both counts. I was sent several emails acknowledging the purchase, that the order was being packed prior to shipping, a photo of the package with my address label and one to say it had gone out with the latest mail collection. Thee game arrived the next day, well packaged and brand new with the seal intact. I will be making Shop To one of my regular stops now as I was most impressed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T06:04:37.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

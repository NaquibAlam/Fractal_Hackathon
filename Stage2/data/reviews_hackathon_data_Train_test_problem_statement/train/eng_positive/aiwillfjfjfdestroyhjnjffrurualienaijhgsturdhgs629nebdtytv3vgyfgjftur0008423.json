My title captures all the W's for Wins in this wondrous adventure that explored the winelands of Parrl (reminiscent of California Central Valley) where you will learn a lot traveling to vineyards, Then there were the safaris, most notably to famed Kruger National Park (the size of New Jersey) where we were fortunate in seeing all the major WILD animals, highlighted by the elusive leopard who dramatically posed on top of an anthill for us. I was thrilled to see Cape Hope, the cliffs, pounding waves, black penguin colony, rugged landscape in a national park. Capetown is one of the \"coolest\" seaport towns I have ever experienced with endless activities and friendly people. Then the unanticipated surprises--visiting an elephant sanctuary and touching all parts of the elephant, visiting one of the world's largest canyons, Blyde River Canyon Nature Preserve, and getting to feed the vultures at the Mohotoholo Wildlife Sanctuary and the opportunity to see diverse parts of the South African landscape--savannahs, mountain rages, desert, rivers, shoreline, beaches, farmland, vineyards, and, of course, Tabletop Mt. National Park.\nBalmy sunny weather, fine hotels, delicious food (inexpensive...and best burgers anywhere).\nThe key element of all of this were our two dedicated, caring, skillful, charming, energetic, helpful guides, Miles and Dan, who admirably strived that each individual had the best possible trip.\n---Kenny", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T18:08:27.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They had originally sent the wrong hat but quickly made it right by shipping the new hat at no expense to me.

I've had several adjustable hats previously, and they seem to fit a little better than this one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T19:02:44.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

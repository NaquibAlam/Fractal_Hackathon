I give 3-4 presentations a week all over the country and have to order lunch for anywhere from 5 people to 50 people. Ordering lunch to be delivered on time in cities I don't live was so stressful. Ezcater makes it easy to order from reputable caterers and have my orders all in one place. They also text me the morning of the lunch and confirm my order will be on time, it puts my mind at ease and lets me concentrate on my presentation. The bonus is accruing points, which travelers like me LOVE!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T23:01:49.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Very smooth process and their online communication system works very well.\nCD's were of very high quality as was the print materials. All of this for a great price.\nI also like how you can order a minimum of 100 CD's (I ordered 200) and you can reorder more with no extra setup charge. This will allow me to order as I go and not have to keep a lot of CD's in inventory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:56:50.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

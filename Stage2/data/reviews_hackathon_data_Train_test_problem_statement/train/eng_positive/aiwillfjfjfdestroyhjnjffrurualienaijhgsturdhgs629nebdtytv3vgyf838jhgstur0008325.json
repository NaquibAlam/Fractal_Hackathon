I spent half a day trying to figure out if it was the CSS issues but no luck this is when I submitted the ticket to Templatemonster. Tyler responded to my ticket within 6 hours and was able to guide me through the process with the right instruction. I have the map loaded locally - I am so glad that I purchased my site through Templatemonster. I would definitely purchase templates from Templatemonster again in the future.\nThanks!\nQuy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T06:43:41.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

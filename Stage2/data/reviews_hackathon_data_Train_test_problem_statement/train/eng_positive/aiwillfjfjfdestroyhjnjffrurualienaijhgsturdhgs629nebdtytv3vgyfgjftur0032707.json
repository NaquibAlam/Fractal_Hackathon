Tried many online brokers and many online direct carrier options. (E, K, AC, Del, etc) Fly internationally approx 5/6 times per year. Never used flighthub before now. Wound up with cheapest flight and best options for the trip (as we have connections both ways).\nIn the end, we checked out seemlessly and got clear confirmations into my email inbox. I did notice my credit card was billed more than I expected which was off-putting. When I realized travel insurance was accidentally selected I immediately understood the reason for the overcharge.\nCalled the toll-free number on the emails summary I received. My concerns were resolved by the agent immediately and he helped reverse the funds back to my card. There wasn't and BS with my request, just very straightforward refund which I was happy about.\nI almost anticipated the agent saying something like \"well, sir, there aren't any modifications once you book. OR, yes I'm sorry, if you want to cancel the travel insurance, you'll have to also cancel the flight, and seeing that cancelling your flight includes fees, cancelling your travel insurance just won't be worth it, maybe next time be more careful clicking buttons\".\nNo at all, was so simple to call in and get service. Clear speaking agent was very easy to understand and very accommodating. Also was very quick! I'm very impressed.\nAs I've been watching these flights for a few weeks, Flight Hub was sending daily updates to my email letting me know the pricing hadn't changed and eventually I pulled the trigger.\nEmails were simple. Booking was simple. Itinerary is very clear. And great service was a very pleasant surprise.\nWould recommend trying this booking service online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T07:03:16.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

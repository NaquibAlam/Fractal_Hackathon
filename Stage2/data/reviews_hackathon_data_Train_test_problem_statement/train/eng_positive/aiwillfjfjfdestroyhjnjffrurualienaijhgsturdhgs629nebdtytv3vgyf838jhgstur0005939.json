Breakfasts were, to my appetite, huge -setting us up for the very full birding day ahead.\nThe other guests on the tour were friendly and knowledgeable as well.\nA few of us were less able than the others, and were accommodated with a stool to get into and out of the vans, guides waiting for us when we fell behind, and guides always trying to ensure that each person saw each bird well.\nThe boat trip was incredible - Guide Skye said that we saw 33 whooping cranes. Two of them were only about 50 feet from the boat.\nI scored 60 new species and my husband got 74!\nThis was our first trip of this kind and we would dearly love to go again and again.\nEagle Eye Tours did a wonderful job which we could never even have dreamed of doing on our own.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T08:28:39.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

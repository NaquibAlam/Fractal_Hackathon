However, I did some research and took the plunge, I joined up for a years membership at a snip of the price during a Black Friday sale (+ they are always offering deals). I then searched many home owners requiring a sitter for their pets whilst they travel away, safe in the knowledge that their home and pets are being looked after. I completely agree with the joining fee as this regulates the members and makes sure they are all genuine + there are a number of simple security checks, which also offer further peace of mind. My first house sit was in Denmark, looking after too wonderful cats in a beautiful home, which cost my nothing but the airfare and expenses. I got to explore the country for 2 weeks and came home to some friendly kitty faces each night, which is lovely when you are travelling alone or with company. I can't recommend Trusted House Sitters concept enough, intact, everyone I met whilst I was in Denmark, I told them about it!! So I am sure I have shared the love enough to get a few more members joining. Really excellent, well done Trusted House Sitters for creating these connections and making the site so simple to use : )", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:40:56.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

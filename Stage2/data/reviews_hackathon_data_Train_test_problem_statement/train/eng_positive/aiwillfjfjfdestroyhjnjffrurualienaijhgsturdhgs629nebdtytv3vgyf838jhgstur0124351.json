Especially Carrie (Ms. Wonderful) who helped me with a few problems I had with some trees. For some reason a couple of trees did not take ,I did not realize there were so many things that can go wrong when planting, and Willis Orchard was there to help me through. Unfortunately a few things went wrong and Willis had no problem replacing a couple of trees that had died. My nephew and I simply did what they asked us to do and there were no problems. My NEW trees arrived last week as promised and they were put in pots due to the fact we had a freezing temperatures and a ton of snow and will be planted in a couple of weeks. YES I would suggest WILLIS ORCHARD to anyone looking to buy plants and trees. Thanks a million to Ms. Wonderful ( Carrie ) for all your help you made a world of difference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:43:19.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

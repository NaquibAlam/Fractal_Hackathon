After days of research, I stumbled on the Certina DS-2 and fell in love. There was only one problem. Certina only has one dealer in the United States, which is nowhere near where I live. As such, I had to start looking online. I found the watch on Jomashop, and it was even at about 2/3 of MSRP due to the holiday sale.\nI took the opportunity in an instant, and ordered on the 21st of December. The estimated date of arrival was the 28th of December, which to me was understandable, as it was during the holidays. Much to my surprise however, it arrived on Christmas Eve! The watch came with a 5 year warranty, and it was exactly as expected. The experience I had shopping with Jomashop was extremely good, and I'll be sure to order from them again. In fact, I've already picked out a watch to get for my girlfriend on her birthday, which is coming up soon.\nOverall Jomashop delivers genuine watches at a price point that can't be beat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:02:49.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

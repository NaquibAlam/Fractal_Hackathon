It was getting worse every year...3 types of diabetic medication and two types of insulin (100 units a day with 5 injections daily). I revamped my lifestyle in the last 6 months.... I was getting better. I started following Dr. Merritt's recommendations outlined in her \"Smart Blood Sugar\" book. Now you can do years of your own research coupled with trial and error excercises I did! After reading this book I realized everything and more that I searched for was covered in a very easy to read and follow presentation. I wear a Dexcom G5 continuous glucose monitor. This displays my blood glucose every 5 min since I put it on 6 months ago. My A1C dropped from 10.7 to 5.7. I stopped taking all my insulin and reduced my other diabetic medicine by over 40%. I also lost 22 pounds. I still have the same diabetes I've always had but my blood sugar is now completely under control! This really works!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:23:43.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

His passion for and knowledge of the area is palpable.\nHe understands property and he understands people. He's not overly reliant upon the metrics of the market but the key is his interpretation of the figures. He's got a suggestion or a solution for every challenge. He's got a whacky sense of humour which is super important; he takes his job so seriously in a professional sense but he doesn't take himself too seriously.\nThere's been this great sense of teamwork with Alex leading all the practical side of things- rustling up the tradies at a tricky time of the year and getting the place ship shape. At every step of the way Alex and Roland have been so communicative- instant replies to emails texts and phone calls- who doesn't love that?!!!\nNet promoter score 10- most certainly would recommend this team to anyone. Thanks guys. Now squeeze out a massive result!\nCheers\nLouise", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T23:47:46.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

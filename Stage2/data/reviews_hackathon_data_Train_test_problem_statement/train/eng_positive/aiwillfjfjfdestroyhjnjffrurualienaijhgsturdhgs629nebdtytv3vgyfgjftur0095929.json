The dates vary from a few days to a month, or longer. My experience has been that both parties, home/dog owners and sitters feel safe and secure in the knowledge that any sits are vetted by a trustworthy business. The back-up for sitters with available vet advice is a godsend. Moreover, the connection with car rental companies and travel agents eases taking on a sit and makes getting there and getting around once there so simple. I recommend the company when talking to possible clients, sure in the knowledge that THS will give them an excellent service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:43:17.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

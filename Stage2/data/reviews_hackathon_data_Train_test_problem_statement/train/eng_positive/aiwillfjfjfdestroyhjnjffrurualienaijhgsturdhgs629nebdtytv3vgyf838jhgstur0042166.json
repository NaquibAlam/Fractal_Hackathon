They have a huge array of basic designs that, unlike other online invitation sites, are extremely versatile and customizable. I had so much fun playing around with different base designs, fonts, envelope types, etc. Not only that, they don't end up charging you a fortune. I feel like I've gone through other sites before, gotten to checkout and thought \"I could just send regular invitations for the same price!\" I was pleased to find out this doesn't have to be the standard. This site also makes it very easy to check RSVPs, even allowing you to set a date for RSVP cut-off.\nOverall, I just have to say that I've really enjoyed my experience with Greenvelope and I plan on using them again in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T05:37:19.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

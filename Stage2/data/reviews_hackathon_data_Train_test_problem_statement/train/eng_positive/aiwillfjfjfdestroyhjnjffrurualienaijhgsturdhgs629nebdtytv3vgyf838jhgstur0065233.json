The installation of Chrome extensions was very easy, the initialization of the wallet was straightforward. The overall process took approximately 10 minutes and after the initialization my KeepKey was ready to receive some BTC.\nI have already sent my funds to my KeepKey wallet and now I can sleep calmly, I am not afraid of somebody can access my funds.\nIn my opinion the \"scrambled PIN\" feature is a very good idea, it makes the usage of KeepKey much more secure.\nI also find Chrome extension very useful. With it I can use my KeepKey on any computer, I only have to install the Chrome extension.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T21:11:02.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

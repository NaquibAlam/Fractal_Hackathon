The last two times the order arrived on time and well insulated. This last time order dated to arrive on 2/16/2017 it did not arrive on time. I can excuse that the order arrived a day late given the bad weather (blizzard) that occurred over the previous weekend in New England. Although my order of frozen lobster tails did not become totally defrosted and un-usable my concern was that the packaging although styrofoam insulated had no ice pack to ensure the frozen contents would remain frozen should a delay occur. Apparently the company must have felt it is Winter and the contents were frozen so no need to provide the cost of an ice pack. It did arrive okay but had it been delayed another day the order would have defrosted and been un-usable. I would still order from them as the product is good but if management reads these reviews they may want to re-think their shipping packaging. By the way they offer insurance on the shipping should it be damaged or delayed but I do not have to pay extra for that from their competitors and the price difference is not that much more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:54:58.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

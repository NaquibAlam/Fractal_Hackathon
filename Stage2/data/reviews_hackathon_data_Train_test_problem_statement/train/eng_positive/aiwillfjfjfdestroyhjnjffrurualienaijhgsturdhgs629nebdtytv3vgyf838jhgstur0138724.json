The comments I have are primarily regarding food (quality and quanitiy) and the surcharge for accommodation.\nFirst of all, I do feel that I was on 2 quite different tours as the trip was divided into Nairobi to Victoria Falls and Victoria Falls to Capetown - each leg with a different crew and changing guests. The highlights of my Nairobi to Vic Falls experience was most certainly an amazing safari in the Serengeti and a few relaxing days on Zansibar. Our crew consisted of a driver and a guide/ cook (2 in 1). And it nees to be mentioned that the food on this part of the tour continously exceeded expectations. it was fresh, there was plenty and we had well balanced meals - protein, fresh veggies/ veggies and carbs every day. Accommodation was more average than great but overall ok.\nVictoria Falls to Capetown the crew changed. and although we now had three people (guide, driver and cook), the quality of the meals went downhill immediately. Carbs, carbs, carbs. Often canned & processed food. and most of the time not enough. While this might be doable for a few days, on a 21 day leg the frustration over food started to impact personal relationships as there was 'food envy' and people started watching over who ate what and how much which is terrible!! I have to mention that feedback was given to the new crew and things started improving....particularly towards the very end of the tour. However, since we all pay premium dollars for this trip, I find comments like 'buy your own snacks' or 'there is not enough budget to provide different food' not acceptable. Especially since I have seen that food preparation can be totally premium if you have the cooking skills, knowledge and passion for food. Accommodation on this part of the tour was excellent.\nHowever, in the end I do feel overcharged by the accommodated package option as the premium surcharge you pay upfront by far exceeds the cost for an upgrade when organized at the campsite. In hindsight I would not pre book an accommodated tour package but upgrade as you go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:44:08.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

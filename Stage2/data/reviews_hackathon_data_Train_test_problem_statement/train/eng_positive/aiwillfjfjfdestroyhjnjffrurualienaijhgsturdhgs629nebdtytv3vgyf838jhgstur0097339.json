It was just before i shut down for the night and I came across Solar Quote: s 3 Quote: s so I entered details with no real expectations. SIgning on next morning I gound 3 local companies had been selected (one of which i am have install a 6.5Kva system next month). Still a little apprehensive i spoke with a trusted friend and told him what had happened and he said Solar Quote: s are good and reputable. Finn not recommend a unreliable company. So with Finn and friend's recommendations I have gone with the larger system. The company rep also said when talking about Solar Quote: s that is easy to get on the list at the beginning but soon off the list if not reputable. And it almost impossible to get back on Finn's list.\nAm happy to recommend Solar Quote: s for their impartiality.\nBob", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:31:57.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

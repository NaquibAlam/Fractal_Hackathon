I just went to the Internet and Googled \"Bankruptcy\" Attorney's in Little Elm, Texas...and there it was; Upright Law...after doing my Research, I find that they have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau; which was in my opinion, a Very Good thing...some of the Boomer Generation; are still impressed with the BBB rating...(at least, this Boomer is) sort of the Gold Standard one might say. I was very impressed with the scope, range and ability this Law Firm has. They are literally a Nationwide Law Firm... One can literally take care of Business Online; and I believe that includes every State in the Union. I cannot fathom the kind of brilliance that it takes to have the Kind of System and software to Manage a Business Nationally...Literally a Network of Law Professionals all over the Nation. At any rate, I called, and spoke with a Young Professional named Angelo. Angelo explained all the nuts and bolts, in's and out's of what, based on the information I had provided him; which Choice was perfect for my situation. I told him that I was very frightened (My Husband passed away in May of 2016) and I had just simply never taken care of anything of this Magnitude In my entire life. Angelo assured me that everything would be absolutely fine, and I should have no worries, as the folks at Upright Law had the reins now. I was told should you have any questions or concerns regarding any part of your situation, give us a call...we are \"Here\" for you...Well, I have done just that...I truly believe the Lord led me to this company via the internet; because I Prayed for his Guidance in this matter...and everything I needed was right there in front of me...and that something is \"Upright Law\" I have and will continue to recommend Upright Law to my \"Friends and Family\"...I do not know what I would do without them...They are the Epitomy of Excellence, Kindness and Caring...and they have proven these wonderful Honest traits many times to me...\nRespectfully Submitted,\nDoris S.

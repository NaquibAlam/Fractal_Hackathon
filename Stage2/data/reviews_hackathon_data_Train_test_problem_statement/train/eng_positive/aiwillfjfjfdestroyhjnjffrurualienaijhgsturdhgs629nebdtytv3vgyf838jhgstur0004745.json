I had ordered a dress for my daughter and it ended up being out of stock. PromGirl immediately contacted me by phone and email to let me know it was out of stock and immediately gave me my money back. They sent me a $20 coupon and I used it when I ordered a different dress. Received the dress in just a few days and was very impressed as far as the quality! Made in the USA, (YAY) and just beautiful. I WILL be purchasing dresses again from this site. Hope they don't change, they are wonderful to work with!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:51:37.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

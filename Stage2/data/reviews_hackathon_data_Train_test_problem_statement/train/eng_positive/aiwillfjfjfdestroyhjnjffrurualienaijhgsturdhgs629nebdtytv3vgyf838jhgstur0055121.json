I'm now pleased to say that for me was easier that it looks. In reality , It was going to spend $100-150 to have it fixed by a tech and/or use insurance, or buy a new tablet. So I took a chance and researched on eBay to see if replacement glass existed to anyone. Knowing it did and what a huge difference in the cost. I confidently bought the replacement touch screen and did the repair myself. I'm so glad that I will always know from now on not to worry about any broken glass again. I also don't care the it's not an original OEM part, but glad that it just works. With this said , 5 Stars all day long.

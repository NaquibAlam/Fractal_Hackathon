However, the line just above reads in part \"We'll ship your order ASAP\". Conflicting statements in my opinion.\nI ordered before 5 AM CST on a Thursday, Then waited until the following Tuesday, the 5th business day after submitting my order to ask what happened to my tracking info. I was THEN told one of your warehouses was waiting on an order to arrive for my purchase to be sent out. Improvement with customer communications needs addressed to keep us advised of situations contrary to your email contents.\nAt the time of ordering, I purchased for the programming of one (1) county to the SD card. My SD card was void of any programming. Possibly the card is being sent separately so I'll wait for a bit longer.\nOverall, ZipScanners is one of the best places to purchase a scanner with numerous informational items online to read or watch for the product you are interested in. In addition to their best prices and services to the customers.\nThank you", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T20:00:53.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The course was very easy to understand and demonstrations were easy to follow and very thorough. It was very interesting to read and learn about how sign language first began and the difficulties deaf people had to go through and still do to a certain point. I thought my personal knowledge of sign language was pretty good however I have since learnt that my knowledge was very little. An amazing course would recommend to any one, even if not for work or personal it's a good thing to learn to help deaf people be more inclusive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:55:44.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

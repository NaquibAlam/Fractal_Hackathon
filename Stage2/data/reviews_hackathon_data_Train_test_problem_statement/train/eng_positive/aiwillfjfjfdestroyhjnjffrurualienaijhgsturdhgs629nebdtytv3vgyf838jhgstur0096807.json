I took a chance and ordered six books that I have been looking for quite some time. The order was confirmed and within two days received a e-mail and a tracking number. To make a long story short, 4 of the six books arrived within a week and the other two arrived two weeks after bad weather. Upon examining the packages I was very impressed at the quality the packing of the books and was very pleased with the condition of each book . Needless to say I was one happy camper . I will definitely will be ordering in the future and will tell others about my positive experience", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T10:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:39:02.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

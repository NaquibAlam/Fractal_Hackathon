My name is Chiqui and I'm a native Spanish teacher. Italki was my first experience teaching online and what an experience it was! The Italki team makes everything very easy for both, students and teachers. They give you immediate support every time you need it, and they provide you with all the structure and communication tools that you need. Furthermore, they provide you with articles related to the teaching and learning process, and they give you the chance to share your experience with other teachers. I strongly recommend Italki if you want to have a customized learning experience with no more worry than enjoying your lessons!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T09:45:27.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

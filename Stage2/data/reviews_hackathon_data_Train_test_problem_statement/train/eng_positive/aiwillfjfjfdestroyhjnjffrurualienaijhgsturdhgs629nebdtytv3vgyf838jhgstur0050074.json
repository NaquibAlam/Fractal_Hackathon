From the moment we arrived and for the next 6 days, my Wife and I loved every breath taking minute. The cabin was clean, cozy and oh what a view. To see my Wife stand outside and soak it all in with the biggest smile that I have ever seen on her face well, I decided right then that THIS place right here would be our annual visit. We have never been so happy and enjoyed ourselves so much in the 25 years we've been together. I encourage you to plan your next vacation with Outrageous Cabins and book the Starr Light or any of the other wonderful and beautiful cabins they have stacked graciously on the hills of the Starr Crest Resort. The only negative thigh that I would say is that they could use new pool cue sticks. They was all kinds of warped. But everything else was perfect. Don't just take my word; try them out. You WON'T be disappointed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:39:22.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

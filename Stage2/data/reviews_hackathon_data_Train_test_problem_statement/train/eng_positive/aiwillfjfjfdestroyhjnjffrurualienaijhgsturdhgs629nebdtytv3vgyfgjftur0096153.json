Honestly, as a customer I liked Darjeelin's system better because the upfront fee was very small, but it looks like their business model wasn't working. It took me a few days to work up the nerve to pay Flystein's €44 fee up front, but I'm glad I did because I wound up saving €85 (after the fee) on an already low price and got a slightly more convenient itinerary to boot. David, the flight expert who found my itinerary, was very helpful and even taught me a few tricks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T20:54:28.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

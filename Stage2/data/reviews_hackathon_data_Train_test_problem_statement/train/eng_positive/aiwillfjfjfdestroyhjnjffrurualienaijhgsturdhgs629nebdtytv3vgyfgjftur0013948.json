After examining a lot of them and their capabilities, I realised that my situation needed a bit of a unique system. Many of the other companies didn't have the type of system I needed and those that did were much more expensive or had contracts that penalised you financially if you wanted out early and others required you to buy a unit for 3 or 4 hundred dollars. Galaxy had many excellent reviews online, which were impressive and reassuring. During this time Chris had been extremely helpful with suggesting a unit that would do the functions I needed and explaining everything I needed to know about how it worked. And the cost was a very reasonable monthly rental payment with no added extra charges. After filling out all the paperwork online, the unit arrived in only two days. Over the phone Chris walked me through the setup step by step, answering any questions I had along the way. My system is now up and running. It does everything Chris said it would do and I couldn't be happier. The following is a list of the pros and cons of Galaxy. Pros - professional, reliable, knowledgeable, reassuring, friendly, helpful, affordable, great customer service and reputation. Cons - I honestly can't think of any. It was a pleasure dealing with Chris. The Galaxy system has now put my mind at ease and I highly recommend it. Thanks Galaxy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T13:19:52.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It offers simple clean shopping experience, free shipping for orders over $20, you can pay with PayPal or card, instant off for ordering 3 or more items and many more. Of course there are always some things that can be improved, but sometimes it is better to stay simple. I can encourage everyone to become a registered customer as you can gain some benefits from time to time. My suggestion is never split an order if it contains multiple items, and never select option: \"ship available items first\" for multiple items order, because sometime some parts of the split order are shipped without tracking number. If some items are missing or if they are delayed, don't wait just open a case. Staff are nice and sometimes answers in a day for any problem, sometimes needs more days to answer simple question but at end they will answer and they will offer you a best solution. If you don't receive your order in timely manner, they will offer you in few days to change the item or refund. If you choice refund option in many cases is better to choice a dx store credits instead of credit card/PayPal refund because it is much faster and you can use store credits during next order. Sometimes it is not as cheap as buying in other stores but it is simpler to buy because here you have different types of products in same website. Also I am personally very tankful to DX because few years ago many western based web shops in US EU doesn't ship to my country, doesn't accept our cards or ask for unreal shipping fee, and DX was very opposite of that, It accepts credit card and have cheap/free shipping to my country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T01:53:13.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The villa was so comfortable and spacious, plenty of room for our family to spread out. The upstairs was great for my mum, felt like she had her own quarters and she loved the roof terrace. The boys made great use of the pool table, table tennis and tennis courts. It was around a 20 minutes’ walk down to Playa Blanca but I liked the location of the villa as it was so quiet and peaceful, we all slept so well. Taxis were so cheap and knew the villa complex well so really easy to get about when we didn’t fancy the walk down and back up.\nThe bedrooms were all so spacious with so much wardrobe space and really large comfy beds. Handy little supermarket over the road and bigger ones down in the town. We ate in a few times and also enjoyed many lovely restaurants down in the town and at the marina.\nTerrie, Anna and Alicia at Optima Villas were so helpful and were very accommodating when we asked for a later check out on our last day. I would definitely recommend and use Optima villas again.\nWe loved our stay at Casa Becca and it really felt like home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T19:38:55.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

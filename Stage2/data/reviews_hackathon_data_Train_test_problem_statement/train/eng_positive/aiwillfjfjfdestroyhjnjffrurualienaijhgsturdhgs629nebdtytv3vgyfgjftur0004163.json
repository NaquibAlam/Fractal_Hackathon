Ten minutes later, I received a follow-up call from a friendly call operator to confirm my booking - it's always nice to speak to somebody rather than solely rely on automatically generated emails.\nI booked two rear tyres to be fitted onto my car, which is parked on a (quiet) cul-de-sac outside my house and opted for a two-hour time slot. No problems with the fitting. Jonathan was friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. The work was carried out before the two-hour time slot was up.

I'm on my feet all day at work and have always bought inexpensive shoes to save money. Or so I thought. My partner told me about The golden boot shoe store and I finally got the chance to go into the store. Upon walking in, we were greeted with a hello and a smile from Vanessa. I explained to Vanessa my dilemma with finding comfortable shoes in my size and width and asked her if I could get my feet measured?. Vanessa sat me down and as she measured my feet, I explained to her what kind of shoes I was looking for. Vanessa brought out a couple pairs of shoes and even helped to put them on my feet and tied them for me. The first pair of shoes were called Anatomic Gel Recife. All I can say at this point is \"WOW!\" these shoes are like walking on clouds. My feet felt so good in these shoes!. I then asked Vanessa if I could try on other shoes to get an idea of what other shoes might be like before I made a decision. Vanessa was amazing! She offered my partner and I am coffee as we waited and then came back with what seemed like the whole warehouse of shoes...haha It was more like 4 or 5 more pairs of shoes. I tried on all the shoes and Vanessa explained the differences of each shoe. She was so well informed about each type of shoe and it really showed in her customer service. Vanessa was so patient and kind with us, especially because we came in kind of close to closing time. The ladies that work on this store and especially Vanessa are AMAZING! when it comes to the customers and it really showed today. Thank you Vanessa and all the other ladies in the store. You made this shoe buying experience very pleasant and I'm sure my feet will be singing your praises. I purchased the Anatomic Gel Recife shoes in the end. These are the most expensive shoes I have ever purchased, but the comfort you get from them from first putting them on makes the price worth it. The customer service recieved today has made this shoe buying experience the best ever. I got what I paid for.\nI will be back again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:36:07.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

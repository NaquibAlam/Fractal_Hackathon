She is knowledgeable and kind. My group was of 14 people total, which we all know can get to be a little crazy. Caitlin always kept her cool and answered the thousand questions that came her way. She asked specific questions so that my vacation was exactly what I wanted. Her attention to detail is amazing. Our tours were great and the fact that the transportation was taken care of as well made for one less thing to take care of. Thank you Costa Rica Vacations for a wonderful vacation and 40th birthday!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:25:18.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

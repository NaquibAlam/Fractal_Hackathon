However, the closest consulate to me would have required me to fly to San Francisco or New York so I decided to give this site a shot. EVERYTHING worked out JUST as described! I received email updates (since I ended up starting the process too early, I received an email that the service would begin the application process as soon the Indian government would accept it -- 30 days or less from departure). Sure enough, once there were 30 days left before my trip, I received an email telling me the application had been submitted -- less than 24 hours later, I had my acceptance email plus a .pdf of the approved visa AND a link to the Indian government website (which I verified) where I could verify the approval status. Sure, I'd love to pay less but this service DELIVERS what they say they will. Also, I received confirmation that the US Embassy had received my registration (an extra optional service I chose that cost another $5, I think). If you're looking for a trustworthy legit fast online service, this is it!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T05:30:05.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

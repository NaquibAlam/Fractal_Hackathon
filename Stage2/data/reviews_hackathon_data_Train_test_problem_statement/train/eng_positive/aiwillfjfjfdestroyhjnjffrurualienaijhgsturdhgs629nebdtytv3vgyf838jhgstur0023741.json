Got a good price from Rentalcars/ Europcar, a good vehicle (Pajero 7-seat SUV) in very good condition, and because of my location I was able to have the car dropped off to me and collected from me. I admit this is unusual, but it was very enjoyable. A good experience all round.\nI have already booked again for this coming weekend, so I must have liked it! I hope they can keep up the standard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:38:56.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

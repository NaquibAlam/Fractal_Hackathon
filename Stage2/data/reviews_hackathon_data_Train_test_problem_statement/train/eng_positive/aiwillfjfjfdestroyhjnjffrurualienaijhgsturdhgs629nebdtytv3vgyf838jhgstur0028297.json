I had thought all was done on-line and our materials had to be exactly as we wanted them. Not so! I had a project manager, a production manager and a mastering engineer to speak with, all without added cost. Mastering pointed out some flaws in our submissions, suggested fixes, we fixed and returned. Then more interaction. It was very refreshing to get this level of service. And prices were very competitive. Dealing directly saved some compared to dealing through CD Baby. They even delayed my shipment until a specific chosen date to match my personal schedule.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T02:03:37.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

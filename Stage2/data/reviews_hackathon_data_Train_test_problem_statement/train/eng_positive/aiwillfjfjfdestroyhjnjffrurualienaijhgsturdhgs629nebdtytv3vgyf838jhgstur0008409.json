They were very informative and helpful from start to finish. Every single rep that I conversed with had knowledge of my case and were courteous and willing to assist me. My divorce was executed in a timely manor and within the exact time frame that was provided to me which was 2 months, actually a bit less even though I filed during the holiday season. I would highly recommend Yaniv and associates to anyone that is seeking divorce, it is definitely worth the experience if you are looking for a firm that is on point in all aspects of divorce and the best course of action to file. I couldn't be more satisfied.\nKind regards,\nJames J. Gibbs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T05:19:59.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

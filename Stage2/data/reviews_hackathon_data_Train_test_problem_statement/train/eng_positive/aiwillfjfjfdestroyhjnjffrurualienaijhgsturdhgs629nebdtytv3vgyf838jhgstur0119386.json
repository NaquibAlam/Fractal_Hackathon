I know that they are old and cost less but I'm happy that this website took them all and it's better than not getting anything at all. They do answer very quickly to email. I like that a lot because I didn't have to be on the phone or on hold or nothing. I got my money and was very happy. I wlll be using this website a lot. I did sent a book that had no value but they recycle guys.

When we received the mirrors, one had shattered during delivery. MirrorLot quickly replaced the mirror. Now both are hanging beautifully in our bathrooms. Thank you for helping us complete our remodel project!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T14:49:26.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I haven't yet tried them for other items like mugs, cushions, etc.\nThe website itself is a mixed experience. If you're creating your own artwork, there are more sophisticated tools on other sites. But the upload system is simple and the preview facility is good – although it's based on the small size of t-shirt, so if you're ordering a larger size be aware that the design won't fill so much of the available space.\nPrices (including delivery) are very reasonable.\nThe t-shirts themselves (at least all the ones I've had) are by Anvil, which is nowadays part of the Gildan group. They're adequate quality and the sizes are legit – so anyone who complains that they're too small may need to face up to the truth that they've put on a few unwanted pounds. Some of the material colours shown on TShirt Studio's website aren't precisely accurate (e.g. heather blue), so if the exact shade is important to you, it may be best to double-check them on the Anvil website.\nThe print quality is good, although some colours come out a little muted. On one t-shirt I ordered (in Smoke colour), my sunshine yellow text ended up looking more like oatmeal.\nProduction/delivery is usually fairly prompt. I've ordered several times, always using the cheapest delivery option. From placing the order to receiving the item, I've had to wait between 5 and 7 days each time. I gather they're sometimes faster than this, but maybe that's more often on items other than t-shirts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T22:08:43.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

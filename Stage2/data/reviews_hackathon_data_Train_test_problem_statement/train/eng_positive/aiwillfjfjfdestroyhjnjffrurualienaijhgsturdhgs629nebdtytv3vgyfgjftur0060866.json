QLP found the products based on my vague descriptions and timelines without a hitch. They were super fast, easy and friendly. We got our order quickly. I would highly recommend QLP for those who need promotional products. Leo was great to work with and responded quickly to my questions with all the information I needed. Also, they are nice and real people to talk too! That experience is so appreciated!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:45:48.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

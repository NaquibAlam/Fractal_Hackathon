The first one I ordered was a bit too small. Luckily the customer service people are so helpful and sweet! She understood my dilemma and readily processed the return and even ordered my new gown in the correct size right away! So easy and convenient! What normally takes 7-10 business days for processing and receiving of an order only took 2 business days with PromGirl! I am beyond impressed and will be using them for all of mine and my daughters gown needs! Thank you PromGirl!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:01:41.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

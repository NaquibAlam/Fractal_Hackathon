For example, the DVD \"Doctor Who: Brain of Morbius\" is $16.67 on OLDIES but $12.96 on Amazon. Another Doctor Who DVD \"Key to Time\" is $79.64 on OLDIES but $58.99 on Amazon.\nOLDIES does have some slightly better prices but only on a select number of products I was looking for. You also need to spend $50 for free shipping on OLDIES, which may not be cost effective if you have to spend more on fewer items.\nI would shop on OLDIES more but if the prices don't budge, I will probably stick with Amazon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:17:11.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

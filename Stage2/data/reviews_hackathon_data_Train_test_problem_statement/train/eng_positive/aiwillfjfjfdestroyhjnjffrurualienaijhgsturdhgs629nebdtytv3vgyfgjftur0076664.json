Well first you have to make an appointment to inspect the property. This is usually set by the real estate agent so that means you have to wait until they decide to open one (usually on saturdays), then you have to do an application form with all your documents (bank statements, visa, etc.) and wait until they open it and finally wait (two to three weeks) for the landlords final decision. Here I should mention that you are competing with other applications so if you are not willing to pay more rent that the one they asked probably your application won't be successful.\nWith flatmates you save all that annoying procedure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:09:38.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

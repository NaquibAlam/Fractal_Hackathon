Fitting was straight forward. They seemed and felt better made. Anyway I have been out for a couple of rides and I don't seem to get any problems, it did with the Giant ti sl. Braking feels a lot tighter and more solid.\nThe adjustment screw is at a slight angle to adjust compared with the Giant but who cares as they don't really need continuous fettling so no real problem.\nSome people commented that they are expensive but I think they are pretty cheap considering the options. I have my brakes fitted to a propel SL with dura ace so I think if I had to buy a set of dura ace brakes they would have cost me a lot more.\nSo overall I am very pleased with the brakes and Mantel for there 1st class service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T12:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:44:55.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

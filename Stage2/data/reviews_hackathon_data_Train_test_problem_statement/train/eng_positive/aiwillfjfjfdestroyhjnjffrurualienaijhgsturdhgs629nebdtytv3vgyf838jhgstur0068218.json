I think they do a good job of incorporating flavors from various parts of the world but with easy-to-follow recipes. I also think their time estimations are usually spot-on while with other boxes I find that the estimated times are often 10-20 minutes less than actually needed to make the reciepe.\nA tip is to open each bag as soon as your box arrives and move the veggies out of the bags (they tend to be on the ripe side when they arrive and the brown paper bags make them ripen even more quickly). This will make your experience better. This is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 - their carrots, zucchini, and cucumbers are often a little soft.\nTheir customer service email response time is quick and in my opinion do the right thing when something is missing or, for example, once we got the wrong recipe card. Both times they've credited our account for the error.\nYou can also save the recipes as PDF from the website or keep your cards to work the ones you like into your regular rotation.\nOccasionally our box also contains a little surprise like a treat that we hide from the kids. That is always nice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T08:11:50.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

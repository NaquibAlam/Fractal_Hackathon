I expected that would be the case as nowhere could I find a ticket the price they showed but figured I give it a try. ($402 for ticket to Manila from Chicago round trip March 26th to 3rd) So I was contacted by a agent named Flora who is very sweet and tried her best to give me the best price with the lowest flight time plus best departure and arrival times. I had a ticket from another aite for $677 but they found me one for $709 that allowed me to get my hotel night in plus had more time to enjoy myself all while getting me a flight under 24 hours as most were around 25 hours up to 40 hours. In the end I was hooked up for the circumstances. I mean, I wanted to buy a ticket for around $550 or so as my brother got a ticket for $491 but it was the last ticket. So a day later tickets rose to 570 something but the flights were for 26 hours plus so I was hoping for a ticket with lower travel time but around that price. The price kept rising and the travel times fluctuated too much. Anyway, ASAP took care of me. It is worth the shot it giving them a try as the ticket they got me I couldn't find anywhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T12:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:40:16.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

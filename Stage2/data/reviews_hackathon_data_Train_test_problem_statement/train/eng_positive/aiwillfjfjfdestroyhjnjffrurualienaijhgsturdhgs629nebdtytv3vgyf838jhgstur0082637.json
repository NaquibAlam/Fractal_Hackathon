My experience with them up to this point has been with metal frames only. The only issues I've had is that the paint on the matte white frames is extremely thin (unlike the finish on their anodized cousins). Even the slightest handling invariably results in marks in the paint revealing the aluminum beneath. Not a good situation if works are being transported to and from an exhibition. I've had these \"handling marks\" occur even with framed pieces individually packaged and handled with great care. Unfortunately they do not have matching touch up paint available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T11:12:14.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Decided to try my hand at self measure. Tried three different companies. iTailor got it spot on for the three suits I ordered. Best fit I have ever had. Good wool blend fabrics (not 100% wool but which gives a good luster instead). Outstanding shirt fabrics. Had a discrepancy on a shirt order and they made me an offer of correction that was above and beyond. Really good price for their fabrics of the week. I HIGHLY recommend this company for your made to measure suits.

I wish however there were a receptacle designed for doserless use. The metal curved bar below where the grinds come out below the chute is non removable; I put a bowl below it. This is ok because it's clearly designed for an espresso doser - the use for drip/french press is less thought out.\nMy old solis (fiinally bit the dust (pun?) after 10 years after its internal gears stripped; I expect and hope this unit lasts long.\nRocky is superior to the solis (espresso grind), equal (drip grind, countertop footprint), and seems by sheer weight to be sturdier.

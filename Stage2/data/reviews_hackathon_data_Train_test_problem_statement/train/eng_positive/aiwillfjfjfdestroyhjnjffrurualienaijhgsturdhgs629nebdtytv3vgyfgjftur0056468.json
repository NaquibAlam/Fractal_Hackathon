Outstanding designs and the large variety of subjects means that I never have trouble picking new puzzles to order. In the past I have always been confident of receiving quality products.\nBad news: I just finished working the Neon Signs (#1061) puzzle and was very disappointed with the board quality. The pieces are too thin to truly interlock and each time I happened to bump the puzzle, no matter how slight,the jarring, large sections would disintegrate and have to be reassembled.\nNow, I will watch for the words \"New, thicker pieces\" to appear in White Mountain Ads. Until then, I have bought my last WM puzzle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T16:43:04.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

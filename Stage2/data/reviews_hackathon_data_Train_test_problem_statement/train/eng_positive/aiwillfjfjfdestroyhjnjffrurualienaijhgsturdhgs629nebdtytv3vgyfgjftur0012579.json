When I stumbled upon Wall Art Prints I realised I'd finally found exactly wheat I was looking for!\nOn top of all that, the ordering process was very easy and the delivery was fast. I was lucky enough to buy what I was looking for during a promotion, but that said, Wall Art Prints are still way more affordable than all those ridiculously overpriced independent photographers out there anyway. For the record, if any of those photographers read this Review, I get you have expensive equipment and you need to cover your time and expenses, but I think you need to realise the average person in the street doesn't have thousands and thousands of dollars to spend, particularly if they need multiple prints\nOn a final note, I made the mistake of accidentally ordering two (2) of one print. I went into panic mode thinking I'd be stuck with it, but no. Wall Art Prints graciously agreed to refund or exchange it. You couldn't ask for better customer service if you tried. This Aussie company 'gets' customer service, unlike many others who wouldn't be as accommodating\nA great company!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:48:02.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

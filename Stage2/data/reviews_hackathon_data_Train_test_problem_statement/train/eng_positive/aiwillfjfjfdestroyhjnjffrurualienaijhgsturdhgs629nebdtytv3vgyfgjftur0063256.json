The next day Franco calls to inform me that only half of the product I ordered was in stock and wanted to know if I wanted to back order it or have Clearbags ship a different product. When I returned his call, I spoke to Danielle, that informed me that none of the product I ordered was in stock and wouldn't be until mid February and needed to know if I wanted to back order the product or cancel my order altogether. Being that I needed the product prior to mid February, I decided to cancel the entire order. The woman literally said, \"Ok, thank you\" and hung up. No cancellation number, no I'm sorry, nothing else. I kept an eye on my credit card statement for a few days after that call and never saw a refund. About 5 days after I thought I cancelled my order, I received a package from Clearbags with the envelopes and bags that I ordered and frame cards that I did not order. I checked my credit card statement and Clearbags refunded a small portion of my original order. I don't want these products which is why I cancelled my original order. Who pays return shipping? Certainly not me! I will give Clearbags a chance to make this right, which is the main reason I gave two stars, but if I'm stuck paying return shipping or anything else shady comes of this experience, I'll never shop at Clearbags again and probably write negative reviews elsewhere as well. Do the right thing, Clearbags!\nUPDATE: Clearbags has \"made everything right\". I am a happy customer and I will give them another chance in the future.

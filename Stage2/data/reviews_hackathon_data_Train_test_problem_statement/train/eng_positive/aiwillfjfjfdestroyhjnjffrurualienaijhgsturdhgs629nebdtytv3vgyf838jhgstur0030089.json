I am able to find most of what I need here and the web site is quite easy to use. I am able to get most if not all of the info on the product that I need. Also, the prices are quite competitive here as well. Almost half of what I have paid at stores like Whole Foods. No harm intended to that store, they get quite a fair share of my money as well. Even Amazon has been unable to compete. So a hearty thank you to this company for doing what they do and doing it well. The customer service department is very willing to help in any situations and is greatly appreciated. Now wouldn't it be nice if every place was like this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T16:48:27.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

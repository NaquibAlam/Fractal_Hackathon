They were very easy to work with and accommodating to our needs. But the real magic happened when Easy Tours in India took over.\nChandni was very attentive and responsive to all of our questions, always emailing me within a short timeframe. Once arriving in New Delhi, we met our tour director, Abid Ali and driver, \"PC\". Both gentlemen were INCREDIBLE. \"Ali\" was friendly, very knowledgeable and took care of every detail, anticipating our needs and questions each step of the way. PC was always calm and cool while driving along the chaotic streets of Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, and all the way to Ranthambore. They made a great team and made the adventure that much more special.\nWe stayed in Oberoi's throughout, except for the Imperial in Delhi. These magnificent hotels became our oasis every afternoon and evening. Great rooms, amazing food, and incredible service were hallmarks at every stop.\nI recommend Easy Tours, Abid Ali, and PC with all of confidence in the world. They will give you the trip of a lifetime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T05:04:18.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Excellent quality ordered a larger one for a traffic area in my bedroom --- IMPORTANT stays in place on top of carpet because the weave is top and bottom. The traveling rug on rug is an ISSUE with regular rubber back rugs. I then ordered a small for master bathroom. Holding up well in that environment and again the weight of the rug stays in place. The color was true to picture...even a bit bolder which is what I wanted. My Bichon dog loves the texture so much I am ordering her a small to throw out in the living room hope to find one that will blend...oh well if not what we do for our animals!!!! Hope Eyes of Indian starts selling furniture...please!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:29:51.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

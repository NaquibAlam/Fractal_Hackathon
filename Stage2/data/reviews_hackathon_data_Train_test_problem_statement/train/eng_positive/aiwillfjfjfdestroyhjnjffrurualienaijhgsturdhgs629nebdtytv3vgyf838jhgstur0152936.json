Was able to meet with her before the scheduled dates, and, later, our experience was A+.\nOur pets didn't even miss us -- in fact, I think they were sad to see their housesitter leave them! We have a stress free vacation, knowing our home/pets were in good hands --and our housesitter had a wonderful 'staycation' at our beach condo. So glad I found this service -- will definitely use for future needs!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T22:47:11.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

No identification was asked for on presentation of this card. Then I was told it would take up to two weeks to get that security deposit returned.\nThis I feel should have been returned straight away given that no payments had to be charged on the return of the vehicle .\nKind regards,\nBettina White.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T15:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:36:26.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The quality of the material is actually top notch and I haven't been dissatisfied yet (I've purchased about 10 outfits so far). I love how they offer tall sizes for their leggings. I'm 5'9\" is a tall option is such a luxury. My only qualm is that some of the outfit patterns are not practical for fitness use. I know it's about style, but some of the yoga tops that have cut-outs can be hard to move in. Besides that, I'd recommend Fabletics to anyone!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:42:54.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

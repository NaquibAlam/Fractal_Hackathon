The favor boxes that Sparkles Make It Special have enough glitter on them to satisfy the biggest sparkle lovers. I have ordered them in 6 different colors. They come in quantities of 10 per package. They are easy to assemble and it can be folded into boxes within 10 to 15 seconds. Quite a bit of the glitter comes off while you are folding and handling the boxes and when I get finished packing them up I have glitter all over me. But, I do love glitter so I just dust it off onto the floor and vacuum it away, I add butterflies to the top next to the ribbon that comes with it and they turn out so beautiful. I get compliments on the gifts all the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T10:09:14.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

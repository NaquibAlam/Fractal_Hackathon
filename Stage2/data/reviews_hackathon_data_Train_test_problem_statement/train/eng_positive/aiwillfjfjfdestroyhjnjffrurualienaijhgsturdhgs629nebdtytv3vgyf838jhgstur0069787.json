We were not sure what to expect but we're thrilled that we had a Globus tour. Our tour director RANDY SCHUSTER was extremely knowledgeable and very professional. He even taught us to speak Hawaiian. The tours were amazing, the hotels were beautiful, meals were delicious and the coaches and drivers were wonderful. I would do another Globus tour in a heartbeat!

But my experience with framesdirect.com was awesome! I checked numerous sites for the same frame and found them cheaper...So I contacted frames direct and spoke with a very nice lady who said they price matched (as long as it was a US based site). After placing my order, I just knew they were going to send an email saying the frames were on backorder...But they didn't! I received my frames in a week and I love them (they are Caviar by the way)!! I can't find this designer anywhere in my area and I've received so many compliments! Thanks again frames direct!

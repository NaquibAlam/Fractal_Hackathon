I was very impressed with the amazing sample pack that was delivered the next day which helped us decide which product to choose.. He was very professional and went above and beyond to deliver exceptional customer service. The process from start to finish was really simple. Everyone loved the flash drives when they arrived and all our staff couldn't stop raving about them. I highly recommend Flashbay to anyone and we will definitely be using them again. Thanks Allister.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T13:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:07:52.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We spent 3 nights with them on our arrival and one night before departure. We had such good dinners altogether. They are so warm and loving. FENRÄ°S their lovely dog is a very special character. We enjoyed all the walks and her company. The house was very nice and confortable. Maison-Laffitte is a very nice Paris Suburb only 20 minutes to the city. Thank you all Nielson family for having us. We feel we have new friends in Paris now and hope that they can come to visit us too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:44:57.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

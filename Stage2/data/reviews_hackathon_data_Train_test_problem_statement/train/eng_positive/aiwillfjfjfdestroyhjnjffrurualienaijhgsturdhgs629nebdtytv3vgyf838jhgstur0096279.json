It meant that we could go straight to the Return bay to drop the car off and not have to worry about chasing around trying to find a service station to fill-up with expensive fuel.\nStaff were helpful and friendly, especially Ben in the Return bay.\nThe car was a late model Kia and a pleasure to drive.\nThanks Redspot.

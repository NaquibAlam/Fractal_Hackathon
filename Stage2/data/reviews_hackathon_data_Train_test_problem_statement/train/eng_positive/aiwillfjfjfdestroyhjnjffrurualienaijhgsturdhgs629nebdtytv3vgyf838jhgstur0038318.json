He was very apologetic for the difficult time I had in reaching them. He explained that they were having some technical difficulties and that is causing them quite a few issues. He has already resolved the reason that I was trying to reach them, so I have re-evaluated my rating and bumped it up to a 4 because of his personal attention to my issue. That is the kind of customer service that will win them another shot at my business in the future.\nI needed to change the date of the flight (that I had purchased travel insurance for), but could not get in touch with them by phone after many attempts. All I kept getting was music, no prerecorded message saying please hold, or anything. So, I went on their website and was excited to find a chat option. However, when I submitted my chat request, I received a message that all operators were busy and would be with me shortly. Then I noticed I was number 36 in line. Well, 15 minutes later I was #35 and now 30 minutes later, I'm still #35!\nSo, I decided to reach out to them by their 24/7 email support. Still absolutely no response.\nI can guarantee you one thing, I will never use this company again!\nby the way, it is now 45 minutes since I started the chat request and I am still #35! At this rate, it will be 3 weeks before I get to talk to someone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T12:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:42:17.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I wouldn't have been able to afford insurance with any of the other companies so I was sort of forced to take out insurance with them. They did cancel my first policy because I didn't sign the direct debit form within 30 days which was pretty annoying. I took out another policy after and I don't have any complaints. 8000Km a year was plenty for me and I get about between 50 and 150 bonus KM's per month.\nOverall I think the reviews here are a bit harsh and I actually would recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:35:07.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

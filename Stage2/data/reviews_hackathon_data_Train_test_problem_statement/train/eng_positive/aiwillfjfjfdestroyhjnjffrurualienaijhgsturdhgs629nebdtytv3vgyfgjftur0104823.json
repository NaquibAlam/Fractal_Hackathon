The lessons were detailed, thorough, and interesting with the use of videos and graphic representations. He was able to log on at his convenience and work on his studies in the midst of his busy academic and sports schedules. It is affordable, easy to use, and takes the hassle and stress out of preparing our teenager to drive. He passed the test with a grade of a 99! I will use this for my next two sons, and I highly recommend it to other parents too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:15:00.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

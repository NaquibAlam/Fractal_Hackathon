In late November I bought a dress that looks gorgeous on the web page, but when it was delivered (2 weeks after because UPS delivered in another house of my neighbourhood by mistake) it was good, but not as expected. I bought it for my civil wedding and I will not use it in that occasion. It's ok but for other occasion because the quality of the crystals and the textile are not that good.\nAlso during the days that I couldn't find my dress, I talked to several members of the staff and some of them (not all) were not as nice as a costumer expect.\nTonight I'm buying a new one in the same page, but another brand that I previously checked on a boutique, so hopefully this time will be the one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:54:25.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

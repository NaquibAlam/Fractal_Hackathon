I could sit here in Norway and order flowers for my girlfriend who is away in Russia for a few months, and she got them the same day. She sent me pictures of the flowers and they looked beautiful. The only two things I wish would be much clearer on the site is when the delivery time is - the flowers were delivered at about 20.00 russian time. And also, when you are optioned to choose the size of the bouquet, you should get a picture which showed what it would look like. I chose the largest one just to be sure, and it looked great. A medium bouquet will most likely also look good, but if you are buying for someone you love I believe the smallest one is not a good option. Anyway, great site and great experience", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T17:40:55.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I listed the tickets on Ticketmaster Resale and they were all sold in a couple of days. I received the same amount I paid for the tickets and was therefore very happy with the service. Ticketmaster resale was easy to use, the listing and selling price was clear, and I received the money to my account promptly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:32:11.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

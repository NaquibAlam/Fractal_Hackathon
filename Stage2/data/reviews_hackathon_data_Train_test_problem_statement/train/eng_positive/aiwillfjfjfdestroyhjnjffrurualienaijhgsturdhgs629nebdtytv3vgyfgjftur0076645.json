Our group was just the right size and our guides, Phillipe and David, were wonderful. They were a wealth of information and so much fun to hang out with for the week. The tour consisted of the perfect amount of group time and allowed plenty of time to explore on your own. Our group was so much fun. Every meal we ate was amazing. My favorite day, by far, was when we did an all day cooking class with Y'van...it was truly too good to be true. After this trip, I decided that if I can only travel to one place for the rest of my life, it would be Provence!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:52:26.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

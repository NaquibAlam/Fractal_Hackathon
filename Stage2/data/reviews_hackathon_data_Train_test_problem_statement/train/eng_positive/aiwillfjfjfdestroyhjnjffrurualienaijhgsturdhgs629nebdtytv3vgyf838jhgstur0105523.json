They payment mechanisms are good - one of my favourite things is that once they are set up as a recipient on my online banking, I didnt have to remember any reference numbers, the money goes to the right place every time. The exchange rates match or beat all the other things I shopped around for, and the fees are reasonable. I think there are other helpful services I havent used yet. great company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T07:18:06.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

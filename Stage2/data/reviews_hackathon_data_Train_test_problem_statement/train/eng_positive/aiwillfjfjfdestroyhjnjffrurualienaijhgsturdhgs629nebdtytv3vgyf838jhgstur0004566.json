However because we had ordered on 2 different occasions & so therefore had 2 lots of taxi box's, he had delivered only 1 lot on this particular day. So immediately he rang their office to sort it out. The driver had another pick up after our redelivery & was about 40 mins away. So after our drop off he picked up the other boxes & took those back to their depot & picked up our other delivery & redelivered those to us & then waited & picked up our empty boxes. So overall it was a big round trip for him. It was a shame initially the office couldn't link my 2 orders. It would have saved their driver less grief, but he took it all in his stride (to his credit) & very professionally as well. He didn't mind going that extra mile even though it was on Saturday & he was already very busy. A job well done on his part.\nThank you for your efforts & professionalism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T04:53:40.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

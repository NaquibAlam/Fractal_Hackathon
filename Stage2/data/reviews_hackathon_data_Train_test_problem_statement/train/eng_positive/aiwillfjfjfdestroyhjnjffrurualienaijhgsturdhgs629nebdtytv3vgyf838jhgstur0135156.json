The paperwork on my cat was not forwarded as requested from previous vet. I explained that these symptoms have continued for six or seven years without any success to cure or heal Maxx from any vet. The Vet read the papers and tried different medicine, took blood and performed the same tests again and some different ones. Everything negative unless I wanted to pay more and more to have additional tests done.\nLow and behold after giving Maxx the meds it worked for that time and then he went back to where he was before I brought him to Ocean County Vet. The medicine was actually too strong for him and had made him vomit which he did not do before and gave him diarrhea. Now that he is off the meds his sneezing has come back. I called in for more antibiotics and only give him half the amount 2-3 times a week.\nI had to determine what my cat needed and how much according to the symptoms he was developing from the meds. Before I can receive anymore I need to bring him back to the Vet for another $400.00 visit. Shame it is all about how much money can we charge this person and not really feel compassionate for the animal and the person.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:39:11.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

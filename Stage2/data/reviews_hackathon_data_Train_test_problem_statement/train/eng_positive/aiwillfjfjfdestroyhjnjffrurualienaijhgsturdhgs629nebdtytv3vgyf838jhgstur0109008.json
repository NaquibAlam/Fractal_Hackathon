We contacted several companies and no one would even try to crack it. To that point in time no company had been able to crack the 2048 bit encryption code. We continued to research other companies and came upon Proven Data. Their proposal to us was if they couldn't crack the code there was no cost to us at all. So, basically we had nothing to loose. We sent them a couple of files to test and within 24 hrs. they cracked the code. We were extremely happy because not only was our data on our server corrupted but our backup as well. They proposed 3 different pricing scenarios based on how quickly we wanted our data recovered. We choose to have it done within 24 hrs. and it was done within a few hours.\nWe can't say enough about Proven Data and how they saved us from a major catastrophe. Their staff was very help full during this trying time keeping us abreast with status emails. We have since then talked to several companies about our experience and told them to contact Proven Data if they every need support.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T05:44:58.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

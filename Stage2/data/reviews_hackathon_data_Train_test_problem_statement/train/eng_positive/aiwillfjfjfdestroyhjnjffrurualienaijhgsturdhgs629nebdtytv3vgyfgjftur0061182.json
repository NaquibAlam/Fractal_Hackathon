It was starting to slowly leak air pressure. I called the support line and we determined the pump assembly was defective. 3 options were given for repair, I selected purchasing a new pump assembly. It was promptly shipped and in a couple of days, I was sleeping on the air bed like it was new again. If only the other companies would be this easy. I am very happy with the air bed, even after 10 years. Their service is awesome.

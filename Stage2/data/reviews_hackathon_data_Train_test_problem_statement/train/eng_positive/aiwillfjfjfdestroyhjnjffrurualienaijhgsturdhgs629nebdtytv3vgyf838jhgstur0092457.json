The salesman feeding frenzy when we entered the store was more tolerable than usual. Our salesman pointed us in the right direction, and left us alone to look around. We found something to fit our needs, and he let us know about deals and financing without pushing us into spending more money. We were in and out in 30 minutes.\nIn the past I've had terrible service in regards to delivery of purchases from furniture stores. They provided us with regular updates ,and were there when they said they would be. The guys who delivered were courteous, professional and clean. For the first time I am completely satisfied with my service. Thank you for not being a dumpster fire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:05:44.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

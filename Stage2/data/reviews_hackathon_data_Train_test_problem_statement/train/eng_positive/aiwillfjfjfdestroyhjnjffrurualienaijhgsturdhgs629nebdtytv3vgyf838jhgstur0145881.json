So ADS Sports Eyewear was having a sale and the selection of lens were awesome. I was able to order a new RX insert with ease. I talked to CS a couple of times with questions and they were always prompt in replies and very helpful and even let me know when they were shipping to me as my company changed the policy and needed to know tracking number so I could get when they arrived. The goggles came and it was everything that was supposed to be with no surprises! The even came with even a nicer case than own that was included for free with order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:24:29.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

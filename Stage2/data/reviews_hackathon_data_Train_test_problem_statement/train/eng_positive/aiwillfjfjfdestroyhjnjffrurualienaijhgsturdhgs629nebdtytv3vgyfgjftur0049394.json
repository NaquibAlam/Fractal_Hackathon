I've told more than a few of my bibliophile friends about the site. One thing.... I think a prompt (or something) to remind buyers to check the \"condition\" of their choice (of the book they're ordering) would help, i.e. I could have ordered the same book (in good condition) from the site (for the same price) but received one in 'fair' condition. My fault, because I didn't look for one of better quality. A reminder i.e. \"Condition Options\" would have helped before I checked out. Otherwise....

One thing is that if I pull the goggle away from my eyes about 1/4 - 1/2 inch, then it becomes clear like my glasses. I don't know whether the manufacturor did not consider the distance of the lenzes to my eyes - goggle lenzes are closer to my eyes than my regular glasses.\nExcept that, I'm very satisfied. The delivery was faster than I had expected. the price was reasonable. I can see very clearly in a swimming pool now.

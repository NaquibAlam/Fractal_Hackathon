I was so well informed by David. He even mentioned about getting registered which no one is informed about and have no knowledge of doing so because they were never informed by their alarm system. What was great also is the Private guard service for only 4.99$ monthly... I jumped on that service. That is genius offering that service. Thank you kindly David!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T15:01:37.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

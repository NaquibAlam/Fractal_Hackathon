I ordered a total of 6 nameplates, all with different content, and different materials, so I had expected a longer lead time. However, I received all 6 nameplates with the holder I had also ordered and, I believe, in less time than the projected shipping date. The fact that NameTagCountry is based out of my home of East Tennessee was definitely a bonus!

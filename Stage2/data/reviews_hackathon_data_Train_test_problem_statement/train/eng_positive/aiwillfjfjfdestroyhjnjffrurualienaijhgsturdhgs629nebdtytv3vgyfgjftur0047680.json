She often was unaware her phone was out of order, unless she tried to use it to call for a taxi. I ring her most evenings. She lives in Newcastle, I live on the Central Coast. She finds the phone easy to use and very convenient, which enables her to maintain communication with the most important links to her lifestyle. Telstra will not provide a satellite phone to people, unless they have specific life threatening conditions, and the paperwork required to be completed is very complex, with a section needing to be completed by the GP as well, then witnessed and signed by a JP. It did not matter that she had a Vital Call device. Hence the Kisa Phone is my peace of mind, that if her landline goes down, I can maintain my regular communication with her, and make her aware of the problem when it occurs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:46:01.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

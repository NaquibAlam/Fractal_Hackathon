It was my first time using them and I was unsure what to expect. I needn't have worried. I bought an item sent from Hong Kong, which arrived quickly (ZTE Z7 Max) with the latest official ROM installed.\nAfter making payment I was kept well informed of the status of the order, then given tracking info for the parcel. All in all I highly recommend this store. They appear to have great prices and the service is lacking nothing. I should add I wasn't paid for this review, nor am I a member of the Illuminati, nor any similar international conspiracy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:10:12.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

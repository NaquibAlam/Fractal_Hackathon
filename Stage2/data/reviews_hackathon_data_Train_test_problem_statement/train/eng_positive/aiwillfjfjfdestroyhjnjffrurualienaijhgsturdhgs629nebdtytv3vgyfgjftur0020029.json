My home is filled with art framed with material I purchased from them years ago. The same is true for my College at Purdue University where I have tried to fill our hallways with beautiful framed art created by our students and faculty over the years. For decades I have created a very personal piece of art for each of our faculty who are promoted and these are matted and framed with material from American Frame. I enjoy calling these orders in for I have gotten to know them. Their customer service is excellent.

I see USB drives in all different cool styles, but never have seen them in wood.\ni ordered one shipment of the wood style usb drives with my company logo on them...after seeing the mock up i doubled my order. I talked to the sales rep 3-5 times in a few hours and they were a delight to talk. i am using these wooden logo usb drives in a conference this week to give away.\nBest company i have ever dealt with over the internet!\nSincerely,\nLance Muller, RLA\nCourtland Landscape Architecture & Construction, Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:45:08.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

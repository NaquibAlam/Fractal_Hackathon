Blinds 2go had a great selection of PVC blinds including patterns that many other places didn't have. It was also very useful to get a sample supplied to check colours and material before ordering.\nThe website was very easy to use and ensured the correct size blind was ordered. Being made to measure did mean the blind was quite pricey but once delivered Fitting was very easy unlike when I have previously had to trim down roller blinds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:06:51.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

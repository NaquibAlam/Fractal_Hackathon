We started doing puzzles again when Dad got sick and we cared for him at home (sadly Dad passed June 13th 2016). To pass the time away. It was always on the table, and anyone walking by would put in a few pieces, and before you knew it, we were all sitting around doing it! Now I am addicted, but only to White Mountain puzzles. So thank you for bringing a past time tradition back into our lives :) we will forever be your customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:57:20.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I ordered 2 sizes as I had no idea what size my granddaughter would need. There was not enough time to order, send back and reorder. Of course, if you want a store credit then you do not have to pay a restocking fee, but you tie up your money for who knows how long? That fee may stop me from ordering again? Other than that we were very pleased!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:58:10.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They made an awful situation easier. There were never any delays in payments, I had the reimbursement back in my checking account within one week. All of his office visits and chemotherapy treatments are covered at 100% and he was even renewed with full coverage for his cancer and chemo treatments. The staff at Pet's Best is so caring and helpful. I cannot say enough about how wonderful the entire company has been to me and Murphy throughout this horrible diagnosis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:56:43.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was there over Christmas and New Year holidays. They made sure I wasn't alone on either day as they arranged for me to spend the days with their family. It was much better than I expected. The house was easy to care for, the dogs were good, mostly, and they provided me with much entertainment (the dogs as well as all the videos). Of all the souvenirs I came home with the one most prized was a short letter to me by the 15 year old. I will always treasure that note. The neighbors were kind, friendly and helpful. For example, one day a storm was forecast and one of the neighbors came down to make sure I had heard the news and he helped me put away things on the porch that might blow away in the storm. I would definitely recommend house sitting for this family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:42:06.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was ripped off by a previous company who changed their pricing last minute and I had to find someone else to move my Brooklyn house contents into storage in New Jersey instead of shipping (beware doing business in NY - ethics can be in short supply, even from the most noble industries, this surprised me for such a great city and having lived all over the world, but it is easy to be short changed here). Several months later and ready to receive my 20ft container, I was hesitant to hire another shipping company for the export to England.\n'Inter Movers LLC' Quote: d a great price, were able to get my stuff out last minute (within the 3 day next billing period for storage) and delivered within a month. Half my contents I had left unpacked - including heavy weight training equipment - but everything was wrapped brilliantly and coded on arrival with help from a great team in the UK that they have partnered with 'Movecorp Ltd'. They expedited the paperwork very efficiently and the delivery guys were very professional.\nDon't hesitate to book this company!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T23:35:28.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

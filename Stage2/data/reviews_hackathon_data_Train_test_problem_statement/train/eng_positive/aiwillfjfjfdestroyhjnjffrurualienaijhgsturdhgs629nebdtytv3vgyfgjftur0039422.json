This was the only dealer able to supply this new and in demand watch quickly and at a significant discount. I had my doubts at first, and spoke with several Omega boutiques about why I should use them instead. At the end of the day, the price difference (after tax at the boutique) was 13K vs. 8900, for the exact same watch. The only justification any boutique could mount for using them instead was a \"warranty\" and \"guaranteed authenticity.\" The watch I got from this dealer, however, came with box and all the warranty cards (the watch just gets shipped from an AD overseas), so that leaves the boutique with basically zero argument to use them and their inflated prices, and certainly not at a 33 percent premium. I felt much more comfortable using this dealer vs. a larger grey market operation like Authentic Watches or Jomashop because you deal with a real person (Darryl) who has been in the business for years, has thousands of satisfied customers (I could not find a single relevant complaint online), and is completely patient - always available by phone and ready to answer any questions you have. The watch I received came on time, in the proper packaging, and was 100 percent authentic. I could not be more happy with this business and will buy watches from them in the future. Anyone who pays a 25-33 percent premium at brick and mortar for \"peace of mind\" and \"warranty\" is basically throwing away their money. Those businesses are going to have to adapt and offer more of a value proposition to compete with ones like this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T15:55:58.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This happened a few times and I ended up booking in a panic for 388 a flight instead of 368 it advertised a flight , and as a single mom the surprise was upsetting as I'm on a budget and use this site often so my last booking upset me as it still advertised for days and refreshed at 368 but at check out raised it and kept asking do you still want to book. I really would have waited for different flight dates and regret booking in a hurry as I need to add a day off with my employer which costs me more too . I hope it's not just a tactic to make you think you have to lock in fast before prices rise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:32:47.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Their savings on flights are very hard to beat.\nI still 100% reccomend you try them out but do make sure you read and understand the small print. but do not be put off by it.\nFlight Hub was very good until I had to change flights due to compassionate reasons. Not their fault, due to a number of different carriers, one was KLM who was able to resolve the problem. I did end up paying a lot more than if I had booked through one main carrier.\nHowever fair to note that 99% of the time this wouldn't happen.\nGive them a shot. this is at least my third time of use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T08:49:13.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

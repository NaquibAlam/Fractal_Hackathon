So I went online to find a local florist in her community. Found Ava's Flowers and decided to purchase them from them. As we live a few hundred miles away. Thinking that if they turned out to be crummy they could a least know to never purchase anything from them. She was delighted and so were we. They were delivered and they were fresh and beautiful. I'm sure that if they ever need a florist they will be their first choice. I believe in supporting local merchants. Thank You Ava's Flowers. Will definitely think of you for the next time in the San Diego area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:10:00.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

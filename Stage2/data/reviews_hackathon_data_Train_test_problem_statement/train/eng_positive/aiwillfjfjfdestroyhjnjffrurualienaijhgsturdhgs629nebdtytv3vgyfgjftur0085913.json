We have been absolutely delighted with the people who have cared so expertly for our pets, home and garden.\nThe sitters have managed minor problems calmly and have kept us informed of any issues whilst we were away. Some sitters even sent photos of our dog having fun.\nWe have made new friends with our sitters; they have all been really interesting, fun, considerate, reliable and kind people. They have all had considerable experience of living in many parts of the world.\nHighly recommend this website", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:39:30.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

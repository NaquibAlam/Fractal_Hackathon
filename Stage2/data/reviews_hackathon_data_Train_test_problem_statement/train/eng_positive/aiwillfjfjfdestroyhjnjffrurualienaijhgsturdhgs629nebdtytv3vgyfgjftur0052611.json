I made a mistake on my order of two gorgeous tablecloths which turned out a bit small for my table. I emailed the company about my mistake and they replied immediately with a solution and sent out the correct sizes the very same day! In a day and age where most shopping experiences make the customer feel barely human and not valued, this felt like a breath of fresh air! Thank you so much to Chuck at Marche Provence! I love my purchase and will certainly order more from you in the future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:34:12.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

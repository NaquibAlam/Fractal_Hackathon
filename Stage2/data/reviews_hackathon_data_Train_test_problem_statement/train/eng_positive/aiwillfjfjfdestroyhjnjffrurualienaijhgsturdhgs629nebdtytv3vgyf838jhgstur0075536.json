I found the course easy to access and very informative, I was able to work at my own pace and revisit areas when I needed to. The information was presented in a creative way and so it kept my attention. However, in one module (4) the information buffered and I was not able to complete the module. I reported this to the technical team but no one got back to me about it. I am unaware how much information I missed because of this. Otherwise a great product and I shall continue to view the website to see if there are any other courses I am interested in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:46:27.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

With our previous service provider it was one week and the direct debit went out two weeks later so we knew exactly when. However with Energia this is not clear and we didn't see a bill until it was too late. Also, we are on a dual plan (electricity and gas) but the bills are not synchronised and this is inconvenient. Otherwise the staff are friendly and helpful whenever we call in and we are happy with the service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T09:38:55.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

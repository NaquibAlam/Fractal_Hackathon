As a course of general business, they are fast, thorough and always willing to make suggestions. With regards to billing, communication or any other business practice, they stand amongst our best vendors. Further, they offer a wide variety of services - compared to some that only handle a portion of translating/interpretation options.\nThe one component that puts this organization above the rest is the associates. They truly partner with you. They are interested in understanding your business in order to provide the best service. Each of the project managers I've worked with has been outstanding. The customer service standard of excellence runs from the bottom to the top of the organization. Burg knows that I am a very satisfied client - but will still reach out regularly to request suggestions for improving best practices or to make sure they are up to speed with our business strategies.\nI highly recommend this company for all your translating/interpreting requirements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T19:06:58.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

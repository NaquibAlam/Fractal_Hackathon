So happy we found Shay at Costa Rica Vacations. After chatting for a while, Shay found us two absolutely amazing hotels--Villa Caletas on the Central Pacific coast and Nayara in the Arenal rainforest region. She also created a wonderful itinerary that offered the perfect balance of chilling by the pool, hiking in the rainforest, and taking in all of the beauty and the natural wonders of CR.\nWhile planning the trip, I had many questions, but Shay handled everything promptly and cheerfully. During our stay, everything went off without a hitch (transfers, tours). Our CR trip was truly beyond our expectations. Thanks so much Shay and all of the wonderful people we met in Costa Rica. We'll be back. Pura Vida!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:18:13.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

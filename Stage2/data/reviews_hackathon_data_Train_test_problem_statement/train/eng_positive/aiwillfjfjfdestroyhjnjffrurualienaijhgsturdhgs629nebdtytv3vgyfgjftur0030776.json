It came in a Burberry box as well. The prescription lenses that I bought were spot on. These are better than any contacts or eyeglasses that I had bought from my local eye doctors office. The clarity is so clear and sharp. Thank you so much! Very happy with the experience. Sarah also answered any inquiries that I had in a fast prompt and timely manner. The only part that was not their fault was the delivery which was supposed to be signed for, the delivery box had been ripped open and it was left in my mailbox. Luckily none of the contents\nHad been damaged or touched and the invoice was in there and in tact. But other than that, I had a great buying experience and they understand prescription eyeglasses very well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T21:21:24.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

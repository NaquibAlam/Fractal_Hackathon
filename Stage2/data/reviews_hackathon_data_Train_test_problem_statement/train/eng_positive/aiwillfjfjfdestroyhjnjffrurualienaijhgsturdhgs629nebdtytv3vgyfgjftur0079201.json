The tour is just wonderful! I discovered a totally different world, absolutely can advise to everyone! The program is intense and very interesting, nature is beautiful, animals are like in pictures, the weather was great: sun and glittering glaciers - the real story! The tour is perfectly organized: international friendly expedition team and the staff is very impressed! Most of all I liked the opportunity to spend time on the captain bridge and BBQ on the outdoor deck!!! 12 days-the most suitable duration of the cruise, in my opinion.\nHowever, there is only one negative point for me personally: this tour does not visit the Russian Bellingshausen station on King George island, that was mentioned in the tour program among others attractions And not because of the bad weather, but simply because it's not even implied! For me it was the biggest disappointment from this trip! I have chosen Poseidon because of the station in the program! But it turned out that Poseidon is not visiting the station, and expedition leader is not even knew about this program (on my question when are we going to visit King George Island,she replied that she did not understand,why we should go there if we went to a nearby island, and when I clarified about station,she added that this tour doesn't go there)! I think it is very unfair moment! I personally, having studied a lot of information about Russian stations and had a great desire to visit the most accessible tourist station, and was completely disappointed with the result. Knowing that I will not can visit Antarctic again, it's a shame that being so close, we missed this item! The idea is that in such interesting and rich nature tour it would be perfect to add visiting of current research station!\nPlease be so kind to delete from the program places that you actually do not visit,please!\nI express my deepest gratitude to Poseidon Expeditions for the trip of my dreams", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:49:31.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

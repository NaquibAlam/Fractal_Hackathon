This is the 2nd I've used them for my tyres, slightly dearer than the competitors but you do get the luxury of having your tyres fitted on your doorstep or workplace. Dave M the fitter was very friendly he even cleaned the wheel of brake dust and dirt in exchange for a coffee. I can't stress enough the point they look after your wheels, no scratches no nothing compared to other tyre fitters I've used in the past. All in all a brilliant service from start to finish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:08:40.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The online store I had been using does not carry the new kind, so I had to go looking for another place to buy them. After much research, I decided to order from OptiContacts.com, and I'm so glad I did. Their per-box price was great, and shipping was free. Another site I checked out had the same price and free shipping...what they didn't tell you was that there was a $28 \"processing fee\" that magically appeared at checkout. NO processing fee at OptiContacts!\nA day after my order was placed, I received an email from OptiContacts advising me that they did not have my prescription in stock and had to order it from the manufacturer, which would add a couple of extra days on to the delivery time. It was nice that they kept me in the loop and explained why there would be a slight delay in my order. But despite the holdup, I received my contacts within the originally promised time frame. Needless to say, that was a pleasant surprise.\nI've heard that you really need to be careful when ordering contacts online at a discounted price...often you receive contacts that are within a couple of months of their expiration date, which is not good if you order a years worth (or more) of contacts. The ones I received from OptiContacts are fresh, and will be used long before they expire.\nAll in all, I am VERY pleased with my experience, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend OptiContacts to anyone.

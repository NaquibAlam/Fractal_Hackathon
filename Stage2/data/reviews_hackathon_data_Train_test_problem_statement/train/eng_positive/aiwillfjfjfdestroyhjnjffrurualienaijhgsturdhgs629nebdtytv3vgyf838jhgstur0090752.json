Next thing I knew everything fell into place & I was able to refinance for a shorter term & still a low interest rate. Had a couple of issues with the on line documents to sign but Zade was fantastic & got it all resolved in minimum time. I was happy with the ease of document review & the entire closing took 15 mins!! Finally the othe loan was paid off in 4 days after closing! The \"app\" is a true time saver & I used it throughout the process!! Overall another great experience!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:32:02.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

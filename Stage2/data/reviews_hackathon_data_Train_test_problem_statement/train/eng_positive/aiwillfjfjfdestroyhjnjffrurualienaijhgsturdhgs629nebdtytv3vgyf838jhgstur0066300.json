However, after praying about this I decided it was the best decision for me and my daughter. I want to be debt free for the latter part of my life and Jeff made the process so easy. He disclosed everything to me, in regards to this loan. The next day business day the funds were in my account and I paid off everything but my car note. Now I can double up on my car payment and have it paid off in 2.5 instead of 5.

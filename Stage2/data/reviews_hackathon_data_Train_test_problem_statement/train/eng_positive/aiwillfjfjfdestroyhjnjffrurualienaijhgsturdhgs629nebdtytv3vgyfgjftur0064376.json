When you have an issue, for example a product you just purchased 2 days earlier gets marked down you have to file a claim through Norton company. After supplying all necessary documents for the third time I was denied!\nAt this point I called customer service back and they were extremely helpful and refunded the price difference immediately. Norton is one of those new scams that are paid by companies to deny any and all claims. The best thing Brake Performance could do is fire the Norton company and do the their own customer service, since they did it anyway, and kept another satisfied customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:01:22.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

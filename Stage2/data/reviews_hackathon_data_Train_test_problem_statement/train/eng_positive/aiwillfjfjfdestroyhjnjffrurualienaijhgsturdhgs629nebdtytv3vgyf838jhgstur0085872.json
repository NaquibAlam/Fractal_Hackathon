HOWEVER, the bag seals on the protein powders are so annoying to close that I'm looking now going to start looking for my protein supplies elsewhere. Sometimes I spend the few minutes required to match the grooves enough to seal them, or have to use a knife to clean out powder from the groove so that it CAN seal. Other times I give up and let the protein remained exposed to the atmosphere which I'm sure isn't good for its longevity. Please start selling in alternative\ncontainers! Other than that, great service, thank you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T17:39:34.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

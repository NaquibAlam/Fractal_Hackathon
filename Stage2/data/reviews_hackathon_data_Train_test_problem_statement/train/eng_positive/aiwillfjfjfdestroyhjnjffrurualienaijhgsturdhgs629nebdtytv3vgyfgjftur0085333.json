We started out with a very confusing selection of about 50 car/model combinations to look at across all car brands. Not only did he talk mainly to my wife about the Kia models available but he listened to her needs. When we left she had the Kia Cerato at the top of our list, not only because she liked the car but the high level of service and information was given to us. What ever your doing keep it up.\nWe looked at 8 different Dealers in Moorooka that day and not one of them have even bothered to call us back or follow up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:09:16.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

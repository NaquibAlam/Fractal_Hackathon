I enjoy the flexibility of being able to log and drive when I want and stop when I want whenever I want. I enjoy meeting new people and having random conversations with the passengers, sharing experiences and more. I've been fortunate and had a great bunch of passengers and not too many on the other end of the spectrum. Lyft provides flexibility for the driver and the best rates as a passenger compared to the conventional taxi. The cars are cleaner, the drivers friendlier, and wait time is less, so why wouldn't you choose Lyft ?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T19:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:11:09.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

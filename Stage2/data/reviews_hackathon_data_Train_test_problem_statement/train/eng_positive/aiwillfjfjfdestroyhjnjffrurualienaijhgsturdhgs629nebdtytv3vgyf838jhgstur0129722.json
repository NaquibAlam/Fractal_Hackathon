A response within minutes during the day and quick resolutions to any questions or issues that you have.\nWe had one issue that took 24 hours to resolve, ideally this would have been quicker, but investigations were underway and resolution was fairly prompt.\nI would like to see some small changes, it would be fantastic to be able to amend inventory from the app (as this would stop me from needing to enter the Amazon Seller Central page). Would also like to see ASIN as being the second field of the export - helps much more for lookups outside of the application.\nOverall great product and great service.\nCould do with a few improvements or publication of the product roadmap.\nA couple of notes:\nTAKE THE DEMO!\nI jumped straight into the product without the demo. Trust me, if you want to understand the repricing rule, TAKE THE DEMO!\nENSURE THAT THE DATA YOU ARE PUTTING INTO XSELLCO IS ACCURATE!\nIt's easy to pass the blame to the system if your data is rubbish. The system will only do what you ask it to. If you ask it to price a product to 1 cent, it will. CHECK YOUR DATA!\nThanks XSellco.\nAndy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:13:21.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

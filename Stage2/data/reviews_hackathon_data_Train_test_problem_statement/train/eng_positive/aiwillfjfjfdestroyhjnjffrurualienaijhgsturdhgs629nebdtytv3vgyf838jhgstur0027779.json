They were all very helpful, and accommodated us at the last minute.\nThere was no Wi-Fi, and the issue did not get resolved. There were small issues with the cabin, including Heating, small animals in the walls, and no insulation between the floors.\nThe cabin was very clean, ready to go, and well equipped. We left coffee filters and dish soap, which would be helpful for the next group. A few extra towels would have been helpful. The beds are comfortable and there is plenty of seating, inside and out.\nThe cabin is located in a great spot, and we used the coupons provided, which was a fun addition to our trip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T13:14:11.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

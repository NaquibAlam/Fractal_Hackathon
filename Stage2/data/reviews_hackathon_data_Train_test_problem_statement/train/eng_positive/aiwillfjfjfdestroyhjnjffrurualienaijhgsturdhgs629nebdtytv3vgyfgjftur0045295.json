It was the right choice.\nThe price was good, and the people were communicative and helpful. They set expectations correctly, and I never got the feeling that they were just going through the motions to handle me by checklist as one of thousands of clients. The pro-active communication is awesome, and I never wonder what's going on, I KNOW what is going on.\nEveryone on my team (and I love being able to say \"my team\") has been professional and polite. I would like to give special thanks to Emily R. and Jennifer H. for staying with my case through the whole thing.\nKen", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:36:31.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

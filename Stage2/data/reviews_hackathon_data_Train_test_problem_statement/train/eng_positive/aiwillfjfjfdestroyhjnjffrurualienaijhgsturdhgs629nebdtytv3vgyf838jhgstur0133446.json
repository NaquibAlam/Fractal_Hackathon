We enrolled our son at the start of the second semester, and we could not be more pleased. Enlightium Academy is working great for us. Our son is able to focus more on each of his classes, and at his pace, and is learning more than at his previous brick & mortar public school. I am so thankful that he is reading his bible and understanding the importance of his relationship with Christ Jesus! The most important teaching is this life here on earth and forevermore. Enlightium Academy counselors, and teachers are available and able to assist whenever it is needed. They are extremely kind, and encourage the type of atmosphere that helps our son to grow. Thank you Enlightium!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T22:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:25:25.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Instead of making excuses she focussed and worked on correcting and resolving the issue. And in the end she ended up saving me money, and winning my business back. I felt she cared about me as a new customer and salvaging the relationship and also the reputation of the company. Before Shawnda got involved I was planning to no longer use this company due to the \"costly\" error that was made by another agent who is no there. I was a brand new customer and after the other agent made multiple mistakes with my policies she wouldn't return my calls, this was escalated to Shawnda and Tara Thompson. Both of them have been great to work with and have made me reconsider leaving. Thank you Shawnda and Tara Thompson for going the extra mile...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T02:58:11.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

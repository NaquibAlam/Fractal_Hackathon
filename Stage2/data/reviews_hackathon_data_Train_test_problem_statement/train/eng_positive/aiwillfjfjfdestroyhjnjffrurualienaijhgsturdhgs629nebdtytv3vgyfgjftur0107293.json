I am very pleased to write that Robert Carbone of Alpha Flight Guru is hands down the best travel assistant I have ever dealt with. I stated my wish to gain the best Business Class flight from California to London for August of 2017--I knew the fares being Quote: d by United and other airlines--and he found me the equivalent seat on the same dates for half the price! That is astonishing. He also handled all the details and kept in touch with me from day to day in a thoughtful and considerate way. I will certainly use him now for all further flight arrangements as I am no position to find such discounted fares but on reflection it is also so much easier to simply hand this over to someone like Robert, as it spares one the hassle. I recommend him highly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:27:53.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

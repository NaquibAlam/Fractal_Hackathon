Originally Jason did not anticipate a problem in getting it on time. A few weeks later, he informed me that the Mavic was on back order within DJI and that he would keep me posted on any updates, but that he expected to receive more in January. While I had to tell my husband about his delayed Christmas gift, he was still very anxious for the arrival of his new drone. January came and went and no drone. Then Feb came and it was Chinese New Year, so the company was closed for a week to observe the holiday. As we became frustrated, Jason kept communication and assured us that it was a waiting game for all of us. On the verge of canceling our order to just order through DJI, Jason had good news and said that he expected a shipment the next week and that one of the drones would be ours. He was right. 3/7/17 we finally received the Mavic. While, the process was frustrating, non of this was Space City Drones fault. Jason was honest, had great communication and was very patient. I would absolutely refer my friends and family to this company that's why I give them 5 stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T13:43:11.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

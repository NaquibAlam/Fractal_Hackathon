Payments are deposited the same day - very much appreciated! (as long as it is submitted within the time frame needed) Customer service has been friendly and prompt. One suggestion I may say is adding in a feature that auto deposits daily. This would be nice for small businesses like myself - which I have so many things going on and am the only person running the show, an auto-deposit would be one less thing for me.

We booked a mid-sized economy sedan for a week in Christchurch. The pick up was prompt and check-in was hassle free. The car was pretty old (135K kms) but had new tires. It rattled and squeaked a bit but drove well. It was pretty dusty when we got it but the staff was quick to take it back for a quick clean. For the price we paid, I was pretty happy overall. Happy to use their service again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:09:45.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

In that regard these guys are doing a great job, and I wish them to continue to build on this! Sincerely thank you!\nUnfortunately though, I have to explain my not-so-positive experience dealing with their call center.\nThe issue:\nMy policy was due to expire on the 25/02/2017 - Friday last week. I was trying to renew my policy online on that day, however I ran into issues with my card which I was in the process to resolve with my bank. The issue in short was that I forgot my PIN, and my bank ordered another pin for me. However until I \"unblock\" my card I could not make transactions online.\nOn Friday evening, just before COB I got in touch with BoxyMo customer service (live chat) as I was concerned with the premium increase if I do not renew before the expiry date. I was told that it all should be fine as long as I contact them (live chat) and the car was not driven/damaged etc. while uninsured. I parked my car at around 23:15 on Friday night, where it stands to this moment.\nOn Saturday, I contacted the customer service (live chat) and have been scheduled a call-back. This went through instantaneously and I received a call at 11:48am. The call-center representative told me the price for 19K kilometers, which was slightly higher from the Quote: on Friday. I explained the situation to them - about my card, that my previous day Quote: was cheaper, and I that I was told this should not change as long as I don't drive the vehicle and get in touch with BoxyMo ASAP. The call-center representative then asked me to wait, while apparently they discussed this with their superiors.\nI waited on the line for about 5min, if I am not mistaken. When they came back they told me that they can get me the previous day (Friday) price - which, if I remember correctly, first payment 363 euro, and then subsequent payments of 100.7 euro for nine months. However, they instantaneously told me that they have to end the call now and that they would call me back in 5 minutes. They told me that they have put me in the priority queue and someone will be in touch right now.\nI waited, and no-one called. This was insulting as call-center representative basically hang-up on me, not suggesting to proceed with premium purchase or requesting my bank details. I was stuck without insurance cover for a weekend.\nThis morning (Monday 27/02/2017) at 9:04am I received a call from one of the call center representatives. They Quote: d me a higher price. I explained the situation, how I was offered a Friday price on Saturday, and that I was expecting a call-back from someone at BoxyMo and no one called back. The lady on the phone told me that that Quote: expired after 24 hours, and that this is the only Quote: that they can offer me. I did not feel she was sympathetic of the situation. I asked if I could talk to the manager/supervisor just to be told that they do not take calls. I then asked her numerous times to talk to her superiors, which she eventually did. In the end just to come back to me to tell me that this is the only Quote: they can offer me.\nNow I understand business is business, but in this case it all just played out so nasty. On Saturday, I was clearly offered a Quote: from Friday. The call-center representative then I presume, hung-up on me intentionally so that Quote: would \"expire in 24 hours\" - as the office is closed on Sundays. As a result, now I am being forced into a higher premium price. Their call center representatives have no sense of making business and following on their promises. Also, how come Quote: s expire in 24 hours, other companies put expiration date for up to a month. I am very positive and looking to get a premium from another company now, even if it will cost me more.\nOn the closing note would like to say that they do give a great value premiums, and live chat support is no hassle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:35:04.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

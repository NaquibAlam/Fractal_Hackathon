When it was my turn the counter staff apologised for the wait and we moved on from there in an efficient and timely manner. The car was ready to go, i was advised of a small scratch near the drivers side mirror so not to worry about that as the staff was already aware of it. I dropped the car the next morning with a full tank of fuel as advised to do and gave the key to a friendly counter staff member. overall I was more than satisfied with the service provided plus the car itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:12:45.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

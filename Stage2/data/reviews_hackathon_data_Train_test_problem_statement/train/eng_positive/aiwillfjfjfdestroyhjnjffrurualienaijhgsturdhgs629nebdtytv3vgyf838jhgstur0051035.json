I was actually doing evites because I am throwing my sister-in-law and brother a baby shower. I thought evites would be the best economically friendly way to send out invitations. Green envelopes was fast, easy, and user-friendly. I am not tech savvy at all and this was a great first experience. They also have such cute evites !! There are so many to choose from!

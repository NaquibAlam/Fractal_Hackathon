We have a dog and two cats and none of them like to be kenneled, so I thought we'd try something different. Trusted Housesitters gets an annual up-front payment, and I listed our house. I had three offers for house sitting within a couple of days. After a bit of back and forth, I spoke to one of the responders on the phone. While I love that Trusted Housesitters can connect people from all over the world who want to make an honest exchange, I have to say that the personal touch of a phone conversation is what enabled us to seal the deal. We negotiated the terms: our house sitter brought her family to stay at our house for a few days, then stayed on herself alone. We met them at the airport, then left them the keys to our car. A side benefit is that she offered to drive us to the airport the next day. A week later, when she left, she parked our car at the airport and when we got off our flight, a few hours later, we got the car and drove home. We saved a ton of money, made new friends, and our pets were as happy as clams. I was nervous, but I cannot imagine it working out any better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:27:10.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

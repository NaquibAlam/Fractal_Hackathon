Although...I was also a little ambitious). Subsequently, I emailed Firmoo Support to return the one I deemed the worst, and exchange the other for the same frame in a different color. After getting in contact with Lynn and having a few days to contemplate because of their factory's Spring Festival holiday, I ended up exchanging both pairs for two completely different ones at no extra charge- which is so amazing of them because my lenses actually need to be custom-made. I am very grateful for Lynn and Firmoo's excellent service, and will definitely purchase my future glasses through them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T17:08:01.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

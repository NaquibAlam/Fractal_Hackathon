He was very helpful. He knew everything and provided print outs and dimensions to help us narrow down our search, as like most areas in NYC space is a premium! We bought the j&m furniture jk038 full size futon/sofa bed. Like most futons it is hard so I'd recommend a foam topper of some sort, which we also purchased while we were here at futon land. The futon itself is great quality and looks very stylish/modern. It even has a recliner bar on one side to lean the sofa bed back to your desired recline angle. Very durable/sturdy. This is not a futon you will keep in one apt and then dispose of a year or two later. This one will definitely come with us over the years wherever we go next!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T13:09:23.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Lots of locations for pick up and drop off.\nThis site would be extremely easier to use if the locations for drop off and pick up were detailed on a map. Very time consuming copying and pasting addresses into maps to see what the best location would be. Especially as a visiting tourist where locations in a different language are so unknown to me.\nI did also have an issue with the site telling me that a pick up location was unavailable even though it showed the location to be open at that time. But I worked through it and hopefully everything works out fine.\nDerek", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T08:55:13.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

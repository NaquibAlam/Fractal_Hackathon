A wonderful example of using technology to the benefit of people. Pets can stay at home rather than go to kennels, saving their Masters worry as well as money and enthusiastic travelers can see the world. Very cool! And it all runs so smoothly and tech support is there at all hours if one has a question. Brilliant idea and our first experience was VERY good! This is a great website that works well both functionally and philosophically. I do wish viewing the photos was easier and smoother. We just had our first sit and it worked out so well for us...we enjoyed the very well-behaved Beagle very much, made new friends with the house and pet owners and got to stay in Australia an extra 3 weeks (for free!), living like a local, learning soooo much more about Australia than we ever could have as a tourist.

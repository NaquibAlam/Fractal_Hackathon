But my request notes didn't make it onto my shipping label, so UPS left my package at a place where I couldn't get it; I was not able to carry this heavy box home from there.\nIt took me three phone calls to UPS, and an extra week and a half, to get them to redeliver to my apartment. During that time I also sent an email to Clearbags Customer Service, but never heard back.\n** Edited -- Thanks so much for your reply, for the credit, and for making my shipping request note permanent. I really appreciate the help!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:51:41.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I have a larger head for a woman, usually about 1/3 to 1/2 inch larger than the circumference most women's hat are made in. But because of a recent visit to the doctor, I am to stay out of the sun, so a hat is a must.\nNeedless to say, this hat has exceeded every expectation!! It fits so nicely, and is a stretchy, breathable material so my head doesn't feel like it's in a corset. The brim is large but fashionable - I've worn this hat with dresses, t shirts, etc. and I love it.\nFrom now on I will always buy hats from Sunday Afternoons! I am so impressed. I have nothing negative to say.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:01:16.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Once on the bus however, it was genuinely only 5 minutes to the car hire centre although it took a moment to spot the cabin among the more permanent looking buildings. Check out was a bit too lengthy due to printer problems, inability to answer my question about the consequences of bringing the car back one hour late (I had indicated a 12 hour rental and may have taken 13 hours so still well under one day) and a bit too lengthy a hard sell regarding 1) and upgrade - clearly not necessary since I was travelling alone with a very small bag; 2) insurance - which I do not expect to be questioned on when I do not want this as it is my risk analysis and 3) request for return flight details - utterly bizarre given that I was returning the car within 12 (or 13) hours yet not flying out until several days later from a different airport so the \"return\" flight and the car booking were in no way linked. The car however (Fiat 500) was very good, clean, easy to drive economical on petrol and very comfortable with radio 2 pre-tuned in! No silly requests to return the car with a petrol receipt from a garage within 2 miles of the depot or any nonsense like that which I have experienced from other rental companies at Luton and a very swift procedure on drop off and the deposit refunded to my credit card before I noticed it had gone. So all in all I would definitely use Interrent again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:37:55.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

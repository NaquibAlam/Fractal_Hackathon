The process was simple, they paid more than a similar company per item, & it was easy to ship. I received my check promptly, for exactly what I was Quote: d.\nI appreciated their policy that if they couldn't accept a dvd/cd, they would mail it back to me, because another company I originally tried, would have just kept them & not paid you. As the \"seller\" you'd have no way of knowing if they were being honest or stealing your items. This company however, is very clear on their integrity & being a fair/honest buyer. Definitely recommend Eagle Saver!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T14:43:22.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

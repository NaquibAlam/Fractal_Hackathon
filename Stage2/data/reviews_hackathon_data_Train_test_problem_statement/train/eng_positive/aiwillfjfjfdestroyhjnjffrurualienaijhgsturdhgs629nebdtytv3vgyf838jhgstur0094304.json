I was pleased to find they had the full set of three cartridges for my Vortex spa as a bundle deal and at a reasonable price. The online transaction process was simple. Shipping time was a little slower than expected but still ok. The cartridges arrived well packed and have given the spa a new lease on life, with improved jet pressure and the ozone generator bubbles are back to full force. I guess I should have replaced them about one year sooner. :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T03:13:15.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

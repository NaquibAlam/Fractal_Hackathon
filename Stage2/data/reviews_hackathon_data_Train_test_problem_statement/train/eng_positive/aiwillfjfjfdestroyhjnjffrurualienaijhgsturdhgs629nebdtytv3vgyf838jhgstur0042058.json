The product seal was damaged and it was a liquid that could easily have been tampered with. After contacting Customer service they sent a prepaid return label. The problem is they wont ship a new bottle until they have received the old bottle. This will add two weeks time to the availability of the product. I think they should have rush shipped a new bottle first and then just credited my card when the damaged goods were returned.\nAs an update to my review, my new shipment has been processed in advance of my returned goods arriving so I'm now a satisfied customer. The extra effort to keep me happy is the way all businesses should be run.

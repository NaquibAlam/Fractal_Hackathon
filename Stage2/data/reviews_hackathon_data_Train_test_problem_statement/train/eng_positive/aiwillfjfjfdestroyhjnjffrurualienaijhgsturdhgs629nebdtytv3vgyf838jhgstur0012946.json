I have had no significant issue with one little exception.\nI once bought tickets that were leaving at 8:00 (what I thought was 8am since in french 8pm would have been 20:00). When I realised my mistake (within 2 minutes, when I received my confirmation e-mail stating 8pm), I tried to contact them to cancell the reservation or book another flight instead and only then was I informed of a 50$ USD charge for changing a reservation. I was a little disapointed, but it hasen't kept me from booking with them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T17:47:55.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

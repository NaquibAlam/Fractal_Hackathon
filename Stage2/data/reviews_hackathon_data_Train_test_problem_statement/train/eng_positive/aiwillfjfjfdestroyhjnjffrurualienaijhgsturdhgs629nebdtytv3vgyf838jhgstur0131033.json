I had been to another children's shoe store where the staff measuring my daughter's feet barely said hello to her and the shoes were too heavy & clumpy, not flexible enough for a toddler. Went into Lifestyle Sports (the Square Tallaght) and the young girl who served us was so polite and friendly and couldn't have been nicer (the receipt said her name was Zoe) she brought out two sizes for my daughter to try on and ordered them in another colour for us and we agreed to collect in the store. When I went back to collect the shoes the other staff members were also so nice and polite and friendly. I just thought it was a lovely experience and I will certainly be buying her trainers in there more often.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:31:17.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

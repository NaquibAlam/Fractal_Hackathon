I wish I had bought one myself years ago. The best hose and fitting I've ever used in the garden. No more hoses bursting off at the tap and shower outlets. No more having to detangle knotted hoses. Looks great no unsightly ugly hoses laying around. All tucked away nice and neatly now. Highly recommend this hose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T11:31:35.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I am not a big fan of doing the pilots cause it scares the crap out of me.... but it worked.. nothing bad happened... Took 2 raids to get the 7 drops promised. Worries me a bit that there is no way to confirm where they used my bonus rolls... and what i got off bonuses versus what I got because i paid for master loot. Kinda wierd to get 4 items the first raid and exactly 3 drops the second raid when the policy is that it is supposed to be a complete raid if you dont get the drops.. but i did get 7 items... 3 of which were upgrades for the items got in the previous raid. Overall i would say that i would pay for the self-played if i did it again. Master loot/pilot doesnt seem worth it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T13:26:41.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

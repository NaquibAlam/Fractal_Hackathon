The sales process managed by one of their agents was very sluggish and the final result of the auction was extremely disappointing and there was no sale. In despair we contacted Open Agent and they did research based on the characteristics of our property and we engaged a new agent based on their recommendation. The next sales process was extremely positive and in the end we got a great sale price and couldn't be happier. The lesson learned is that you need a great agent to manage your sale and open agent certainly can help you find that agent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:54:43.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

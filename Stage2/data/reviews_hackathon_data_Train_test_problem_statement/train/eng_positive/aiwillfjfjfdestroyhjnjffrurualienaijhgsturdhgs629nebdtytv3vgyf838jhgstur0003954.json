There's never any hassle and the claims process is fast and so easy. My claim took 6 days from start to finish and that's unbeatable in my opinion.\nMy poor pup Yoda, had an ear infection so off to the vet we went. Thankfully it wasn't too expensive but it's so nice to know that I get most of what I paid back l, especially since I'm a single parent of 2 teenagers. It's nice to have at least one thing in my life that's hassle free! I love knowing that my dog is always going to be protected and will be able to stay healthy.\nI tell anyone I know about the importance of pet insurance and of course how great Pets Best is. I couldn't be happier with my choice!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:26:55.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

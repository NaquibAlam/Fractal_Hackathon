I was pleasantly surprised to find that shipping cost was low and promised no surprise extra charges getting across the border. Also very fast shipping. The dresses shipped within two days and we had them a week later. I was nervous about making such an expensive dress purchase online without having the opportunity to try the dresses on. But the size guide was accurate and the dresses we bought for our twin daughters graduation were both perfect. Highly recommend this site for anyone shopping on a budget. I bought two beautiful grad dresses for the same price i would have paid for one locally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:57:14.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

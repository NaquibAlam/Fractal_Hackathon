Using the advanced search option, if the book is available it will show up. The best way to search for a hard to find book is to make several individual searches: 1. author first, 2. title, 3.keyword , 4. publisher. For my convenience I can place a book on my wish list, then go back and compare it to similar items. Sometimes a book on my wish list is sold to someone else before I get to order it. That is ok. I will find another one. It is a good idea to search for your wanted items at least once a week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T10:48:26.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

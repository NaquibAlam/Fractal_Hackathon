I am so glad I became a customer! They have great prices for the dog food and amazing customer care. When I underestimated how much food the puppy would eat, all I had to do was click \"ship now\" and the next day there was food for Jet. Furthermore, when a collar didn't fit, they refunded me the money and asked me to donate the collar to an animal shelter.\nExcellent company, we plan to be lifetime customers!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:15:59.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

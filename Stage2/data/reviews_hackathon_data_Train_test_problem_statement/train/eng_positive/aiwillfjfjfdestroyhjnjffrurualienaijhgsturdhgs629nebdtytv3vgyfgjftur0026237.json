There is a design maker there too, but I didn't use it. It was as easy as that. The cards came in about a week, they are good quality and fit for purpose.\nMy only suggestion for improvement is the payment methods, in order not to be charged for using a card when paying, I had to pay via Bank Transfer, which was a faff. I don't think a big company these days should be charging customers for using a credit or debit card to pay for products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:52:50.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

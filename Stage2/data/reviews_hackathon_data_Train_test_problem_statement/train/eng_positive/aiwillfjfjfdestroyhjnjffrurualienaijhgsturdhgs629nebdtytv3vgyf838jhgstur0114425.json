On recommendation I tried the One bars a few weeks ago and thought I'd found the best bar out there. Today I spoke to a knowledgeable sales person at my local Popeye's, she recommend two different brands that suited my needs as explained to her. FitJoy was one of her top two choices. I tried a cinnamon one right there in the aisle and was hooked! I bought a mixed box of 12 on the spot then went home and ordered two more boxes on Amazon. These bars taste GREAT! I actually like the taste and texture. A bit higher in calories then maybe my ideal but not by much. The ingredient list seems reasonable and I would consider this a \"clean\" protein bar not full of a bunch of junk. Finding the right bar isn't easy and actually takes some genuine research, I've done just that and think FitJoy has ended my search. Not cheap at $3.50 CAN but certainly comparable to other bars of equal quality. Cheaper slightly by the 12 pack or online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T13:09:09.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I don't mind cooking, but I tend to make the same old things because I have no real inspirations. I also over-buy and cook way too much than we need, and we end up wasting a lot of food. Hello Fresh is perfect for us. The portions are ample but not too much, the quality of the ingredients is wonderful, and everything is included, even milk and spices when required. The meals are delicious and include many foods we don't normally cook.

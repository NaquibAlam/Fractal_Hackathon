I am using Eco Web Hosting with the courses that I am currently taking and find their control panel very well done. It was very easy to setup everything.\nMidPhase works well, however I would like to access my cPanel directly and I have not found a way to do this yet. One advantage is that I can use FileZillla without going to MidPhase first to unlock FTP. After only a few weeks and not being that knowledgeable in this area, it is difficult to give a fair rating. It works for me and my Website is on line without needing any assistance. Some assistance may be required later on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:37:21.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

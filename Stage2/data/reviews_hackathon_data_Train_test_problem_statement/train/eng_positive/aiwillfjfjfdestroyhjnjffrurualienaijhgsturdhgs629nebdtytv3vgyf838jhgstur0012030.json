Patrick was incredibly responsive and helpful in planning our trip. We booked the 10-day Classic Thailand Tour featuring Koh Samui (Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Koh Samui), and Goway's local partner, Asia World, was also fantastic. We wanted to make some changes to our itinerary while we were in Thailand, and Asia World was great about accommodating us, and suggesting other activities as well.\nThe only glitch was that our Bangkok hotel was booked with the wrong hotel (we were supposed to stay at \"The Siam\", but we somehow got booked at the \"Siam@Siam\" instead). We were disappointed since \"The Siam\" had what I think would have been a more intimate and upscale experience (it's also a 5-star hotel, versus the 4-star \"Siam@Siam\"). The error was on the part of Goway, and they stepped up, offering up options for how we wanted to proceed. Mistakes happen, and I was happy at the way Goway handled the situation. We opted to stay at the \"Siam@Siam\" since the hassle of moving to another hotel didn't seem worth it for us, so Goway credited us for the trouble and arranged for a LOVELY dinner and bottle of wine at our next hotel in Chiang Mai. Great customer service, and like I said, a great way to manage expectations and smooth over mishaps.\nI highly recommend Patrick and the Goway team ~ they were a pleasure to work with!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T19:49:22.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

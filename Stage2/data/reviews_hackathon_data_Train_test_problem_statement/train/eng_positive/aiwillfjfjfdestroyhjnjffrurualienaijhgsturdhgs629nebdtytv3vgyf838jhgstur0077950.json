This turned out to not be true for what I ordered. I called up Right Channel Radios and notified them of my situation. Not only were they extremely helpful in pulling up my recent order and explaining exactly what I needed, they also packaged up the stud I needed and got it shipped out the same day, even though it was late in the afternoon. Great service and fast shipping, they will definitely get my future business as well as everyone I tell about them. Thanks for making the process that much simpler!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T23:04:06.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

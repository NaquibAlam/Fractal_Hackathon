It was OK but woke up with backaches and general aches and pain that you would attribute to either old age, stress, not enough sleep, animals walking over you and waking you up, etc.\nDecided to get a new mattress and , like everyone else, did a lot of internet research resulting in a lot of opinions and a general headache!\nHeard about Loom and Leaf and looked at your info and reviews ultimately decided to \"make the leap\".\nOrdered and was kept \"in the loop\" concerning production, advised on shipment, called about delivery, delivered the product and removed the old mattress without any complications! Incredible!\nAsked the Independent Delivery crew, who were very courteous, about the Mattress and was told that of all the mattresses they deliver there are very few returns or complaints with Loom and Leaf and seems everyone loves the product.\nFirst nights sleep and I can say my wife and I slept thru the night and woke up with no backaches or general aches and pains! The \"cool\" claims and spinal support are real!\nMaybe we're \"over excited' about the first night but it's the truth and we'll keep you advised as we progress thru the nights of great sleep!\nThe only problem we encountered was that our cats still walk over us but they love the mattress during the day when we're not on it!\nThanks for the great Product!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:11:29.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

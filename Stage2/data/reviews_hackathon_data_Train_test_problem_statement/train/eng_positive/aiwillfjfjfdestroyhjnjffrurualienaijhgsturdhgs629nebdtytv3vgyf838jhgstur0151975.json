In addition to the \"compare-a-matic\" grid giving me up to 6 machines' specs at a glance, the associated videos provided live demonstrations of most of the machines I was interested in and because of that, I was able to narrow it down to a few that met most of my criteria. When I finally engaged a salesperson, they really DID assist me in narrowing my choices to the right machine for me, not just trying to sell me up to a higher-priced machine (especially when they'd determined that I wouldn't have really appreciated the difference in cost) My ordered machine arrived on time and well boxed (well-protected). For the few times that I've called tech support with questions, they've been courteous in their advice, emailed me links to videos that assisted me in diagnosing problems and making adjustments on my machine and then following up afterwards to see how things went. WOW!! When was the last time a non-brick & mortar firm went to THAT length? This company has \"hands-down\" won my repeat business for my next machine, which (sadly for both of us) may not be for quite a while as I'm confident that this machine should last a long time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:52:11.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I can use their own Control Panel to control the server, and they have FTP access to configure the files easily.\nClanwarz has a FastDL system, which you can sync up with your files by a click of a button.\nI had some trouble with some CS:GO plugins files, where my files wouldn't download to the user properly, so I wrote to the support and they answered within 24 hours (often within 1 hour). And they made sure it worked.\n(I've had some hosts that didn't care about such problems and would just say it was my problem. - But Clanwarz helped me in a perfect way, and that's what you call customer service)\nLets sum it up:\n+ Great Ping/Locations\n+ Much Control\n+ Great Support\nIf you are trying to find a host for your game- and/or voiceserver, then I would recommend Clanwarz.\n- Marc", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T18:40:58.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

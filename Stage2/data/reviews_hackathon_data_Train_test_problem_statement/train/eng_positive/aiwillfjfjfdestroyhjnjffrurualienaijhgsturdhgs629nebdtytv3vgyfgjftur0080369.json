The trip was a huge success! One of our best family trips ever. We have 3 kids, ages 9-15. It can be difficult to find the right excursions and accommodations to fit all of our needs. Robin, was so helpful with all of this and had fabulous suggestions. We were so pleased, we are using Robin again for our trip to Panama this spring. I give her and Costa Rican Vacations my highest recommendation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:25:23.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

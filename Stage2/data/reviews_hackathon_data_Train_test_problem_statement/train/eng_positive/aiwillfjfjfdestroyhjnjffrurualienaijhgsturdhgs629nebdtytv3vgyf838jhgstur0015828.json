The meals have been great, only a few we weren't fond of. It's so nice to not have to grocery shop as much with the delivery to our house, which is consistent. I do wish the recipes came in the book form like they did the first two weeks instead of the giant card form. The meals tend to take longer than stated on the cards, but nothing that isn't feasible. Overall very happy with the decision to subscribe to HelloFresh!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:36:49.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

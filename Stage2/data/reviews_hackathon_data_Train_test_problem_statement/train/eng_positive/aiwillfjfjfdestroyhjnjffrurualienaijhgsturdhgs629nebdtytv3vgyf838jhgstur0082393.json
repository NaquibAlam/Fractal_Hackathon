She was efficient, quick, extremely helpful, and corrected all the mistakes made by the corporate office who locked-in my reservation for a storage unit. It's the people like Janis on the front lines that makes a company successful. I highly recommend trying to work with the on-site managers instead of the corporate offices when you choose a storage company. These \"on-site folks\" are the people that really seem to know the properties and are not giving out false information about the units \"just to make a sale\".\nThe facility and grounds looks clean and secure. And the customer service has been great. Be wary of dealing with the corporate office and just work with the on-site manager so you don't have to redo all the incorrect reservation paperwork. If the corporate staff had been more knowledgeable about the properties (or at least more willing to match the correct unit with the customer), I would have given the review 5 stars. 4 stars isn't bad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T10:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T10:55:54.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

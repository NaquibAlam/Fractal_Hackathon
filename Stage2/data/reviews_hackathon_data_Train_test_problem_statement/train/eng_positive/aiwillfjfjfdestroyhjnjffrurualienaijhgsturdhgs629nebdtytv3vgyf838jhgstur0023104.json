I've never been diagnosed with S.A.D., but I have noticed in the last few years that the short winter days have had a dampening affect on my world. In researching the various offerings, I became convinced that Alaska Nothern Lights had the reputation and product I was looking for. Within a week of using the light 30 minutes each morning I began to see amazing results. I'd always been a night owl, and suddenly I was going to bed many hours earlier, sleeping better and rising VERY early in the morning, without trying, and feeling very energized. I sleep much more soundly, and when I do awaken in the middle of the night, I'm able to fall back to sleep with no trouble. I would NEVER have thought I could flip my day and night as I have. I'm much more refreshed and happier on this more \"normal\" schedule. It is certainly worth a try if you seek deeper sleep and more energy. With their generous return policy, what do you have to lose? Good luck! :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T04:43:11.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

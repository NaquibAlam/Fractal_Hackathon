He responded to emails SO promptly- unlike anyone we've ever worked with before. It made planning our travel super easy.\nThe best thing was that they use Facebook messenger-- so if you run into any snags (like a flight getting cancelled) or you want to add some additional excursions while you're on your trip- you just send them a message and they do everything for you. It is ZERO effort. Our hotels were exactly what they had described, the excursions were fun (not hokey or lame), and the customer service was truly excellent. I cannot recommend highly enough. I shopped around with other travel vendors and none compared. I recommend CRV- and specifically Aaron- to everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:28:19.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

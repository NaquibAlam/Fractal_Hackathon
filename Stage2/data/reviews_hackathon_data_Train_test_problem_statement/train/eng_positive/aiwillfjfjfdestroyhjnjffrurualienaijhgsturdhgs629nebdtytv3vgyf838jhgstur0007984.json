This is a great middle ground between something such as a digital volcano and a Buddha. Doesn't feel cheap and it's very easy to use. Comes with some extra parts, a whip, and two bags. There are usually 2 or 3 glass pieces being used during any given time so I wouldn't recommend it as a party vape, instead keep it for solo use or to use with a few friends.\nThe price was fantastic and shipping only took a few days, I'm sure it would have gotten here even faster if I didn't order it on Saturday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T20:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:39:03.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

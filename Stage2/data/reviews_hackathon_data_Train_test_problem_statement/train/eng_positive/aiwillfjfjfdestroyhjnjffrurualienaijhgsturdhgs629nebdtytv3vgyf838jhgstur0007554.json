The company picked us up at the airport and took us to their office about 2 minutes away from the airport. The paperwork was done quickly and the car was clean and had a full tank of petrol. I was really pleased with the car, it was well equipped, comfy and the engine was pokey for a small/medium car and this was very welcome when tackling the local terrain. The drop off at Christchurch was also efficient, followed by a short shuttle bas ride to the terminal. For the price and quality of car I would definitely use Omega again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:06:27.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

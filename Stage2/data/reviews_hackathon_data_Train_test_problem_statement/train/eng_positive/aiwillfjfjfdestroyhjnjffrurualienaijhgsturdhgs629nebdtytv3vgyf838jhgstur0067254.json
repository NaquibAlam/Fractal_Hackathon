I explained my situation to Kevin and the price point I was hoping to be able to work with. He found some tires in stock that were comparable to the ones I had narrowed it down to online. I was happy with that because I was a walk in customer and I didn't expect that the tires I liked on line would be in stock. Kevin checked my car and noted that it needed an alignment. I knew it would from the way my tires had been wearing. I informed him that I intended to get two more tires in a few weeks when I get paid, and I would get the alignment at that time. He didn't try to push the sale of the alignment which was greatly appreciated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T10:08:51.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This was my 10th ticket through flighthub. I have travelled to 4 continents with flighthub tickets and never regret it.\nThis trip was from Canada to US during a long weekend. Again I found the best deal on Flighthub. Its easy to research because all details are broken down and quickly comparable. Based on my experience, I can always be confident I am getting the right price.\nThis time, upon confirming my booking on the website, I missed the optional seat assignment fee. This option was unintentionally selected and I phoned flight hub immediately to correct it. The agent quickly and effectively corrected it and refunded me the difference.\nThank you for another great stress-free experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:58:10.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

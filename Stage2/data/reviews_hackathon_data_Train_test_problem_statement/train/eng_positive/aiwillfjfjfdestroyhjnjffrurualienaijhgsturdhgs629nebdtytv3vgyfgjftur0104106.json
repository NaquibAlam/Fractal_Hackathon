Trusted Housesitters was by far the best site we looked at. The profiles are thorough for both sitters and homeowners, it is very easy to use, the feedback and reviews give you confidence in your choice of house sitter. There are so many features that other sites just don't have. It basically takes you step by step through the whole process and makes sure you don't over look anything.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:46:53.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

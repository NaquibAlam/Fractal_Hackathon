Took option of having samples sent.. think I ordered 3 lots of samples as we hadn't decided what colour we wanted but settled on one finally. They were quite expensive but I think this is normal for roman blinds. Cannot fault the quality, really good quality. Fitting was easy, try the clips before you put it up. We didn't and couldn't work out how to get them on but once we worked it out it went up fine. Comes with decent screws and rawl plugs so everything is there to complete the job except a drill. Would definitely recommend and will be ordering again when time comes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:51:06.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

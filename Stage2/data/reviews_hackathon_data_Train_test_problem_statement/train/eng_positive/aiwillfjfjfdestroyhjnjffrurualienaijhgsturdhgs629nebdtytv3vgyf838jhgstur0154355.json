It is not only a good way to help others learn about the good and bad with other companies and your own experience but then you can also look up others comments and experiences. I have not only had wonderful experience with this site BUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SECOND TO NONE! I have had a representative by the name of Brittany helping me out because I first review a company under the wrong name, they used to be one name now they are another and then they noticed I had two accounts under different emails. I had forgotten I had made up another account back when I had that old email. Brittany was able to (with my permission) delete the other after I emailed her from that account and requesting it. They have safety in place that I like such as that and also it showed that they do read the reviews and see that you actually are purchasing from the company and about your experience. I am very grateful to not only Brittany but this site also..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T04:28:40.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Alot of work to wear it because it looks nothing like the pic. i also added an elastic strap in the back. i been buying synthetic wigs so the style pretty much comes as seen because its easier to manipulate synthetic hair into a specific style. not the same with human hair. i also tinted the lace because the medium brown was still a little too light. next time ill get the darker brown. i really love this wig. but just know you're gonna have to do some work to wear it and it look good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T14:52:59.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was in so much debt with credit cards... it was insane! I was making my payments on time for years, but couldn't get out of debt. I had heard of David Sklar and Associates Inc. through a television ad. I decided to call them up for help.. it was one of the best decisions I've ever made! The advisor who helped me was professional, non judgemental, and compassionate. I was informed on some choices and felt relieved after having made a decision to go with bankruptcy. I strongly suggest you call up this company for a no commitment appointment. You'll be glad you did it... I sure was! :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T10:39:11.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

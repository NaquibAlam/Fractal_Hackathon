Guess what.... I lost them two months later. Shocking, I know! So not wanting to spend so much again but loving the brand and style I searched online prices for replacement glasses which is how I found Otticanet. I have to admit the price with the prescription was so low ($185 +/- after a 15% discount) that I was really skeptical... but at that price why not take the gamble? Not knowing what would show up (if at all), they took about 10 days to arrive and are EXACTLY like my old ones! Yay! The prescription is even right (I did the silly online eye spacing test which I was sure wasn't going to work... I was wrong, it worked great). The only thing I have to do is go somewhere so they can bend the frame slightly to fit my face properly -- and pretty much any eyeglass store will do that for free. So, Optticanet thank you! You are my new go to for glasses and sunglasses and for everyone else, give them a try. The only possible reason to pay more is to have them in a day or two from a physical store but considering I saved almost $400 dollars to wait an extra few days, you'd have to either be pretty impatient, dumb or desperate not to buy from them. :) Hope this helps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T23:08:32.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

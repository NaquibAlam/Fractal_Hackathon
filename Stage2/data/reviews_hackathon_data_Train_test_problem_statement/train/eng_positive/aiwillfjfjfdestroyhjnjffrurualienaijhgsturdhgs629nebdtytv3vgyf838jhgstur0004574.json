Good quality , little disappointed in the wheels / tires , have quite a bit of wobble in them brand new . I would expect that from a cheap bike from walmart . Not from fit bike co.

I cannot fault the bike shop , as it came in a box to them . I know they would make it right , if we were local to them , and they would have assembled it .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:09:00.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

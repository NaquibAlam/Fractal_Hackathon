I was glad to see several options, but it would have been nice on certain pages to be able to sort by those only available in my size. Also, I tried to order some \"outfits\" and when I went to the cart, they were not the price that was on the page where I had selected the items. It was supposed to be a first time order special, but it didn't show in the card, so I deleted and did not order the outfits. One time I clicked on a link and it said it couldn't find the page but I got there another route. Looks like web page could use some better development.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:16:39.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

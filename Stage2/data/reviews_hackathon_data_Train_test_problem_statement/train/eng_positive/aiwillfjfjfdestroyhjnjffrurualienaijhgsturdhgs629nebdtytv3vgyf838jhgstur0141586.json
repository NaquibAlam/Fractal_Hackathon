I particularly enjoyed the layered service in that the manager comes over after the the sales person presented my app. No haggle, no pressure, they show what vehicles you qualify for, and you make the decision!\nThe only bad mark is for the process. After choosing the vehicle, paying the down payment, it took incredibly long for us to get and go over the paperwork and sign the contract. Improvement needed here for exceptional marks and reviews.\nQuickly Drivetime redeemed themselves by placing a phone call to me the very next day. I was actually impressed and shocked to have received a call from the General Manager. I would recommend my friends, family and foes to shop at Drivetime. The service, professionalism, autos and after care is unmatched!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:45:59.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We were shown into a lovely private room and before we looked at any rings Nicole wanted to find out a bit about us and how the engagement happened, which was a lovely touch and made the visit feel really personal. We then shared some information with Nicola about the budget we had in mind and any particular styles that we liked. After a few minutes Nicole then returned with a number of rings to choose from. Throughout the process we were very much encouraged to go home and have a think about it and let them know our thoughts. The following day we saw a ring in a jewelers that we really liked, however, because we loved the experience with Voltaire so much we sent Nicole some details about the ring and within a few days we received a response that they could create something very similar for us. We went to see the ring on a Saturday evening and we were both absolutely delighted with it and would have taken it home there and then if we could have! Even then there was no sense of pressure to make a decision, Nicole asked us to sleep on it and let her know by Sunday evening. We emailed her on Sunday and picked the ring up on Wednesday and we are still both absolutely delighted with it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:05:35.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

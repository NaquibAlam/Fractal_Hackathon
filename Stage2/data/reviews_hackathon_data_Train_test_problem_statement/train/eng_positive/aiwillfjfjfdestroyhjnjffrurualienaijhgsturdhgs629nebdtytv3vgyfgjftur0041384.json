I always compare prices before I buy so I can get the most bang for my hard earned buck. Thriftbooks was, hands down, the best value. I ordered every book I was originally looking for and even filled up a new wishlist for my next order! I loved that there was an option for not only new books but also for used. I also love that it recommends other books you may like based on what you have already ordered or things on your wishlist. I'm so glad I found thriftbooks and will definitely keep using it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:24:15.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

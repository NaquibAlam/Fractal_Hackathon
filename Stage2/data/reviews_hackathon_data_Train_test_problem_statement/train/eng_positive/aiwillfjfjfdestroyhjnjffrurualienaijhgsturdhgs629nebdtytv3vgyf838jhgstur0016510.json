That being said, I am writing this as my honest first impression of the company, its product and more importantly its customer service after the sale.\nAs a long time console gamer, dating all the way back to the original gaming system \"Atari\", I have always been in search of equipment that makes my experience more enjoyable and hopefully me more competitive as an online gamer.\nI recently purchased a refurbished Benq RL2460 Monitor for myself. I've always played my console games on TV's (of various screen sizes) and while being aware that the true competitive players have been using these special monitors for as long as I can remember watching competitive play but being a recreational gamer though that it wouldn't make that much of a difference. Well in my opinion, based upon my game play since purchasing a gaming monitor, my scores and online ranking continues to rise!\nNow fast forward a week or two since my purchase. While playing my favorite first person shooter I notice some issue with my screen resolution and immediately think dead pixels (but I was wrong) so I contacted Benq customer support by email and am pleasantly surprised by the quick, friendly and informative response that I received. I was given the option of receiving a full refund or a replacement monitor (along with an apology for the inconvenience). My customer service representative \"Robert\" was very helpful and responsive to my needs. He provided reliable information and did exactly what he said he was going to do. It's my opinion he served as a great ambassador of the company and its commitment to providing service beyond the sale. While this was my first purchase of a Benq monitor it certainly won't be my last. I'm very glad that I chose to make this purchase despite having a problem.\nThanks again Robert (if you ever get to see this) for making my experience a pleasant one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T21:11:51.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

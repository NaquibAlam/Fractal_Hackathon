I saw that Always Riding had one on their website, but it wasn't very clear if it was the one I was after and if it would work with my helmet model. I emailed them and got a response very quickly, the lady who responded was extremely helpful and did some investigating to see whether it was the correct helmet insert I needed. Not only was the price competitive, it also arrived within 2 days and was nicely wrapped. Would definitely recommend them!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:38:54.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

With a big thanks to Bill. Once I explained my situation and the outcome I was after, it was explained to me exactly what I would require and why I would require it. And in simple terms also. These guys are nearly 2 hours from where I live but definitely well worth the trip. I am very happy with all the equipment I purchased and installed.

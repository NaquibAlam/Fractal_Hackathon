It would have been very helpful to have had a comment somewhere on the ticket or the accompanying documents, since for a newcomer it is certainly NOT obvious! As a seasoned traveler, I know to expect surprises along the way, so when it comes to travel connections - clarity is good! Makes the trip less stressful. Thanks again.\nWe are travelling Brussels to Paderborn and are not familiar with Brussels transportation infrastructure. The tickets indicate clearly method of travel from Bruxelles-Midi to Paderborn HOWEVER the part from Bruxelles Central to Bruxelles Midi is not explained nor does it show on the tickets: Is this by subway, another train or some other means? How is it ticketed? (It does not show on the tickets but does show on the booking). I guess we will have to research on site.\nVery confusing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T15:00:00.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I can't stop checking what's new. I've purchased an entire new wardrobe these past few months due to a radical weight loss since last season. Shoes, bags, dresses, sweaters and more. The sales are just awesome too. The one complaint I have is that returns take forever to get your credit. I've been waiting on one credit for over a month. Other than that, the quality is acceptable - not top of the line, but not Walmart either! I like the up to the minute style choices!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:49:57.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

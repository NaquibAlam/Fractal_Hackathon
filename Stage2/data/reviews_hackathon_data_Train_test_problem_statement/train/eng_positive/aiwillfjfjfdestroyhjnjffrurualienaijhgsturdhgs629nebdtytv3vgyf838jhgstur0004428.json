Creative recipes that are typically prepared in 30 minutes. The service saves me a lot of time at the grocery store and hunting for recipes. As single person, I found myself wasting a lot of food so the pre-portioned ingredients are perfect when cooking for one. At first, I thought the cost was high but I'm saving money by not throwing away food. Added bonus, I've learned a few new cooking techniques. I definitely recommend this service to professionals looking to add some convenience and eat healthier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:29:47.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

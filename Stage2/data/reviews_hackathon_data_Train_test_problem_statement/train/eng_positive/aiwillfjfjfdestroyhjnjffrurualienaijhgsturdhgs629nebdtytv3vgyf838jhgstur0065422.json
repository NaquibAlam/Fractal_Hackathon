The one receptionist was doing an intake, and excused herself from the new client and checked me in. I was very appreciative. So I sat down, I had to be somewhere after my appointment and seemed to be taking a little longer then I expected. I got up and asked the girl behind the reception desk, how long it was going to take as I had another appointment to get to and she reluctantly got up to ask the nurse who had clearly finished with her client before me. The receptionist came back out to the desk and said the nurse will be right out, when in actuality I needed to go back there, as the nurse was ready for me in the treatment room. Before I went in the room I asked if I could schedule my next appointment with her before I was treated and she said that the nurse was ready for me now and that I can schedule my appointment after the treatment. I finished my treatment and walked out and she was with another client and was not able to schedule my appointment. That's fine, but I don't appreciate the lack of engagement from the receptionist. I have had a great experience with the nurses and most of the receptionists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T07:05:44.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

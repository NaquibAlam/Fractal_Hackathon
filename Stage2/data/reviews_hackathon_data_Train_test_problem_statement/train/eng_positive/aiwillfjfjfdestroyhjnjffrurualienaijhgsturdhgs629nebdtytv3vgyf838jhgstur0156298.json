Every dealer seemed to be the same. They would tell us we qualified, have us come in, and then tell us they couldn't get us into a F-150 but could put us in a different vehicle ( this is something we had done before). We finally decided to take our down payment and find a used vehicle for a few years, praying and hoping it would not break down or that we were wasting our money. Then we heard of DRIVE TIME, decided to give it one more chance, applied thinking it was pointless. We were approved instantly through email, still thinking it was to good to be true I talked to a customer service agent on the phone who verified again that Drive Time would be able to get us into a Ford F-150 of our liking. So we drove to Drive Time in Waukegan, Illinois still skeptical. When we got there the Sales Manager Tyler was very friendly ( although SUPER busy), and began to help us until one of his sales agents were ready. The fact that he took time out of his busy schedule had me SOLD. We then sat down with Kris, went over our finances and what we could afford. Kris was so funny, down to earth, and friendly. He did not make us feel that he nor Drive Time were better then us or looked down on us as the other lenders had. He was amazing. He explained to us that Drive Time offered an extended warranty, and an extra vehicle insurance in case anything goes wrong with the truck.. A WARRANTY... EXTRA INSURANCE....SOLD AGAIN. It ALSO had a carfax!!! Just kept getting better and better! The truck that we picked out was not on the lot, it was about an hour away. Kris told us to go grab our little ones from school and that he would go get the truck and bring it back.. that we could drive it home that night!!! And that is exactly what we did! When it came time to signing all the paperwork we sat down with Tyler, the sales manager, who was very helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. Trust me, if you are looking for a down to earth, friendly, helpful dealership.. THIS IS YOUR PLACE! It's seriously like that dealership you dream of but does not exist anywhere for people with less then perfect credit, or that live on lower incomes then what most dealers see fit!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T15:24:41.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

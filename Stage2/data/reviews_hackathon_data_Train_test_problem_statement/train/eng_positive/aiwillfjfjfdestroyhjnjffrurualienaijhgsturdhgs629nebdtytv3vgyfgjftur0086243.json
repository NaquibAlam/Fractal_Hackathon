We have moved to another country, not knowing anybody here, so it was a struggle to find somebody who we could trust to look after our chihuahua girls. One day, already desperate, while searching for kennels close to the place where we live I have spotted the ad for TrustedHousesitters. My dream came through. No more stress... Girls have been happily at home while we needed to travel without them. There is another of these journey ahead and I am sure that the website will not disappoint me and another nice and reliable person will come to look after the girls.\nThanks a lot TrustedHousesitters!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:46:25.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The issue was resolved with little difficulty, even though it was one outside of their control. But with the information received from one attentive and knowledgeable agent we were able to get my parents on an even cheaper flight to their destination. Since then I go first to flight hub, I travel a minimum of two times for the year, mainly because it is very easy to confidently book my flight. The site is easy to navigate, partners with all airlines, has great tools allowing the user to see the best and cheapest flight options for better planning and booking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:56:14.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The facility itself is exceptionally clean and well managed with knowledgeable, helpful and courteous attendants. They can supply one with many of the necessities for storage and moving. We have been at the facility on different days of the week and times of day and never had any delay or difficulty in accessing our unit. The climate control is cool but not cold and seems to have a constant humidity. A larger moving truck had no problem accessing the facility or the unit. We are very pleased with the service that is provided.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:47:56.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We're a professional membership and scholarship generating organization with 1 paid employee, a strong board of directors and active working committees. Sam's recommendations cut the Administrators clerical time in half which frees her up to work closely with scholarship applicants, recipients, membership recruitment, sponsors and donors. Sam listened, reviewed and gave the best recommendations and built the site to be both a tool and working partner. Thank you Sam and Fixrunner.

I called Customer Service and they sent out replacement meals immediately (even added in some extras)! Wonderful customer service. The meals and snacks are awesome! I've been ordering a lot of the extras because they are so good. Who could believe you can eat this well on a diet plan. I normally don't share with people when I'm on a weight loss plan but I've been so pleased with Nutrisystem that I've told my co-workers. Great customer service, excellent food and I've lost 20 lbs in 5 weeks!

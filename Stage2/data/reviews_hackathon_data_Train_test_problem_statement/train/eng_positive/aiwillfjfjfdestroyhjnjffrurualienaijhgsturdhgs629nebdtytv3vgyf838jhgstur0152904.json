I have been using the College Planning Center for 3 years for both my son and my daughter. Sitting down with the staff has always been a pleasurable experience. They are extremely knowledgeable in all areas of the college world. My appointments have been fast and on point. They take all the confusion out of the application process when it comes to applying for financial aid. I did make one attempt at updating my daughters 2016 FASFA, apparently did it wrong and made an appointment right away to get it fixed. I won't make that mistake again and will always use the College Planning Center!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T22:34:30.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I live in NYC, so am fortunate to be nearby some of the most reputable jewelers in the world. I looked, with intent to buy, at Tiffany's, Graff, and Cartier. Eventually, I came across Leibish & Co. I put Leibish in competition with the best of the best as noted above. Ultimately, thanks to their impressive inventory, exceptional customer service, phenomenal product knowledge, and a no-pressure sales environment, they won my business. Not only is the final product better and more beautiful than anything I saw at any 5th avenue store, the process was an absolute pleasure. Meira, and especially Itzik, thank you. I look forward to doing business with you again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T16:30:14.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Helps in exploring and shortlisting on the cheapest and bang for the buck cars across airports\nLike the fact that the site has a rating for each of the providers on its site.\nWould like to see some more info/details about the insurance packages that are bought on the site. My impression was that the insurance packages bought are from the car rental companies, but that is not the case apparently\nAlso, would like to see textual reviews specific to each car rental company. That would help me decide one over the other. Currently, the only deciding factors are price and rating. Which might not be enough to make an informed decision.\nHowever, my experience has been smooth so far with no problems faced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T15:57:47.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

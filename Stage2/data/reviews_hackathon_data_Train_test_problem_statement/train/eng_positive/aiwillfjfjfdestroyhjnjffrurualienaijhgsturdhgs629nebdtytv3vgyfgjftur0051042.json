MirrorMate to the rescue!! Honestly, I was thrilled with the outcome of this product. First of all, the number of options they offer is outstanding. To the point where I was wavering between 2 or 3 options on their website. As I mentioned above, I couldn't find ONE reasonable option before them. Second, the product shipped quickly, it was not damaged when it arrived, and all instructions, pieces and \"equipment\" needed were included. It was extremely simple to assemble, and installation was also relatively easy with a helper. Lastly, the plain mirror I purchased finally looks complete and classy with this frame.

I had 1 br, maybe 2 for n instant, so I wanted to ensure I had enough boost to allow everyone to use with no problem. It is directional, so you need to make sure you get the direction right and then you may possibly have to \"fine-tune\" it. I had to install the atenna (I bought the whole kit) at the highest point of my house to ensure it cleared the home next to me. Also, be sure you buy the lightening surge protector ($87) as well as a rated surge protector for the inside as well to protect your investment and your warranty (see your instruction). You would think for buying the whole kit at $900, that these items would have been included, but they are not. Price is steep, but I don't have to worry about not having a good 3-4 bar signal anywhere around the house.

I was worried that it just wouldn't work, but Biblio was so quick to respond to my requests that the whole process went incredibly smoothly. Not only that, the book arrived in no time - I think it took about three days total to request a PO, place the order, and actually receive the book! The shipping costs were very reasonable and, again, so fast! We couldn't have done better on Amazon, and of course the book wasn't available there anyway. I highly recommend!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:56:15.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

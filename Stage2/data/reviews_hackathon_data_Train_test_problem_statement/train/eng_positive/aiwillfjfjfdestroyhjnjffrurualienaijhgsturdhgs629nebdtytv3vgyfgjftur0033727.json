When receiving my booking confirmation my name was slept as such: Magdalene Favre-Bulle Favre-Bulle and the return flight was not the one I selected. This is unacceptable. I have taken screen shots from my computer to show that i did in fact select an evening return flight. This issue caused me to be on the phone for almost an hour, for an error that was not made on my part. Yamini was extremely helpful and helped me fix the issue. I was very grateful for your help but very disappointed in eDreams. It was the first time I booked on your website, and will definitely be the last...I now had to cancel my reservation, and rebook and wait 3 weeks to receive my reimbursement. All caused by an error on your part. I book flight frequently for my job and never have experience such a hassle. I'd like a reply to this email with an explanation and acknowledgement on your part of the error that was made. Yamini considering was very kind and resourceful.\nThank you", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:48:15.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

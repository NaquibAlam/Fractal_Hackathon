Extremely welcoming and very warm, kind and easy-going! Her apartment is just lovely and in a most wonderful location. So much good food! We had a blast exploring the city and having her dog, Bonbona be our tour guide. She was such cool dog to get to know, with an exceptional personality and fun and happy disposition. We miss her already! Cheryl's communication and hospitality were awesome! She explained things clearly and thoroughly, which I truly appreciated and was very happy to be available if we ever had any concern or question! We felt so comfortable and at home because she made it easy to feel that way! Thank you Cheryl and Bonbona!!! Hope we can meet again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T13:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:52:41.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

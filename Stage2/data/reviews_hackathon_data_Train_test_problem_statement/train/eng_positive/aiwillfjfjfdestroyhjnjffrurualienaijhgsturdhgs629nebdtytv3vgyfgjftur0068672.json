There is a small fee of course but it is very reasonable. They also accept all major debit and credit cards and also PayPal which is awesome. I find Ding supports all the main mobile networks in every country. Highly recommended and I rate it 5 out of 5 stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:36:20.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Alexa did a great job designing and coordinating the trip. We only had one small problem, which SA was aware of before us, and got right on fixing (you can contact the US office, but are also given a local office contact to help as well)\nYou will be greeted at the airports and escorted to your hotel, so no worries there. The tour guides (private guides and transportation) were professional and knowledgeable and really enhanced the trip. The hotels ranged from very nice to spectacular. The flights (coach, but I imagine you could upgrade) were all on Avianca Airlines, which did and excellent job; clean, modern, and better service than I expect in the US. The cruise ship was small (15 passengers, but could accommodate 24), which allowed fast small tours with an experienced naturalist, 2 stops per day; be prepared for lots of walking and swimming.\nHINT: We stayed at Inkaterra Hotel at Machu Picchu, stay and extra night to enjoy the hot springs and spa after a long day of hiking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:32:48.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

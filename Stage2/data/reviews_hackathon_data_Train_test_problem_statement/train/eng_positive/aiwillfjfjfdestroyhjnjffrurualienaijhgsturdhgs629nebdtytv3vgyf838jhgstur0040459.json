The if's is what we need to consider while putting our keys in the door of our vehicles BEFORE starting the engine, thus making us become more conscious of our surroundings and taking others into consideration when setting out to drive. I would recommend this course as a Graduating Requirement for Seniors of high school as well as a Recomendend Refresh Coarse after 10-15 years of getting a license, because even pros need re-sensitizing. ðŸ˜Š\nThank you,\nZina Thomas", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T15:27:28.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The online ordering is simple and straightforward and dispatch of the items is very quick. Unfortunately I gave in a misleading address and DHL claimed they could not deliver the package. I phoned medpet and they immediately offered to send out the same order again without even waiting for the first order to be returned to them by DHL. You cannot ask for more than that! I will certainly order from medpet again - but next time with the correct address from the start!!! :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:40:41.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

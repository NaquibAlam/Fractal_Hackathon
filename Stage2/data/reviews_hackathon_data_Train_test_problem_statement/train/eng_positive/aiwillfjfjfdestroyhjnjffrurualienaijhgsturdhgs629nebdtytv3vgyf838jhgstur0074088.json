Why? Because I am in Australia and the international postage fee of $50usd was just insane - but now the threshold for free shipping has been lowered and the standard international shipping fee a more reasonable price I was happy to place my first order :D\nI enjoy the minimal design of the site, the photography beautiful, styling cool and love the huge images. Checkout was easy and I was so happy to find you had stock in the size I needed where most other stores had sold out.\nThe next time I'm in the market for a luxury purchase Ssense will be my first stop!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T22:11:41.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

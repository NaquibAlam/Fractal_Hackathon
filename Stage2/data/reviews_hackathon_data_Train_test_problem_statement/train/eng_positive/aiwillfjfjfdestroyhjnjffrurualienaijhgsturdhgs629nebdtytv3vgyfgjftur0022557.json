Yes, I had spent time getting better deals off Amazon but with the \"May not ship to Uganda\" being the limit.\nThanks to USGOBUY who offered me not only a free US mailing address but too ensured that my shipments are delivered in time. It only takes a matter of minutes to create an account and get a free US mailing address since its very easy.\nWhen it comes to shipping, USGOBUY is a service I trust, and one I can recommend to everyone. Yes, sometimes there are some delays which are out of their boundaries but still, USGOBUY gets the item arrived very quick no matter the shipping option.\nMy last delivery arrived in only 10 days as opposed to the 1-7 weeks waiting time when using standard shipping. USGOBY, thanks for the great service..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:49:42.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

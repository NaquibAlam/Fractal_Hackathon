I expect that it will continue in this regard for many years and miles to come.\nPros: Call them or send them an email and they will answer you.\nThey have a good reputation and my experience supports it.\nThe transmission arrived in a plastic crate that fully covered the contents and provided an easy method to return the core.\nThe price was less than a local shop wanted for a rebuild, and the warranty was better.\nShipping both ways was included in the price.\nCons: Only one, you need to plan on sending your core back to them quickly. When I removed my original transmission there were other issues that I needed to address. Since I was only working on this project on the weekends I needed an extra couple of weeks to get it all back together. I also wanted to keep my original until the replacement had proven itself for a week or two. I was told that keeping the core too long would affect the warranty of my replacement unit. Though I have been pleased with the replacement (and ultimately didn't need to worry about it) I would've liked that extra time to keep my core nearby until I was ready to send it back. Mind you I'm not talking months here, only a few extra weeks.\nThat said, my overall experience was very satisfactory. I would buy from SST again and will recommend them if the opportunity arises.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T22:49:42.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

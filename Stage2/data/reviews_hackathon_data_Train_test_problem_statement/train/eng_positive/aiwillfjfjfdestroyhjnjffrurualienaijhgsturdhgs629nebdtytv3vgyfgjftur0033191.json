It took not even 5 minutes to confirm my flight. Then I go look on the official Air Canada website, and my flight was already confirm with my seats. I booked my flight 1 months before the departure.\nThe only reason I don't give a 5/5 star is this one ;\nWhen you search your tickets they give you many prices and the cheapest they can found. And the prices are cheaps. But once you book they will tell the ticket you choose was already taken and they have another one but more expensive. This is obviously just bad marketing. But my ticket was still cheaper than other website. But I hate when companies do that. They just think you are stupid enough to believe them.\nBut like I said, everything was fine, cheap and quick.\nGood flight website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:03:18.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

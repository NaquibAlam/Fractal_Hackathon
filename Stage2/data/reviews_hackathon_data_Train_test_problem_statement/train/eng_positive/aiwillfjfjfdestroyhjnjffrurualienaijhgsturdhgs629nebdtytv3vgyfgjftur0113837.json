I called Verizon and the nicest person was on the other line waiting to assist me, her name was Jensen. She was by far the best. She did absolutely everything she could to get me what I wanted and the price I wanted. She was by far the best experience Ive had with Verizon so far. So was extremely nice, helpful and kept me laughing the whole phone call. She needs to get a promotion or a raise because she was great. So thank you Jensen for making my experience with Verizon amazing. I hope that anytime I have to call Verizon I get you on the other side. Thanks again!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:20:01.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

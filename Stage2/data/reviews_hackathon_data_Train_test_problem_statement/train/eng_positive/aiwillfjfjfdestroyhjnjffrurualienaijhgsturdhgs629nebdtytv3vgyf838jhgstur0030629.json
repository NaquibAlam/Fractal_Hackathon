I fiddled around with lessons as a teenager for a short amount of time and gave it up. With a busy career as an adult really didn't think I had the time, but after becoming disabled and not being able to work anymore, I thought about things that would bring me joy at a time when depression it as a result of my health situation. I again knew in my heart that playing the guitar and enjoying music would help me get back my life again. I purchased a guitar set of DVD's and started the course as soon as I received it in the mail and started at the beginner level only to find I was quickly frustrated with knew I was not getting anywhere. I started researching top guitar learning programs on line and reviews from people and Guitartricks kept coming up as the top all inclusive program for beginners. While looking into the Guitartricks website I was so impressed with the format, the instructors and their skill level and working at a pace I felt would help me learn and make it fun at the same time, that I took several of the free classes and was so impressed that I decided to sign up for full access. I couldn't be happier as I am going through guitar lessons because the site offers so much and instruction through the lessons I've taken so far are geared towards simple steps and I can go at my pace. Instructor is oriented at making you feel like you can achieve your goal at becoming a guitar player no matter what age you are.

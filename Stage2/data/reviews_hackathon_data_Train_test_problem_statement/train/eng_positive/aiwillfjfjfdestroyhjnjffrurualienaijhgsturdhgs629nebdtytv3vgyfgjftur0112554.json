I had not bought from Zodee before but took the chance and rather than asking for a refund, chose to wait for the products to come back into stock. It took a couple of months but just as I was beginning to think I'd made a mistake trusting that they would turn up, the products arrived. Well done Zodee. I'm now about to re-order for both myself and a friend and have recommended your company to a number of other friends. And the products .... pantyhose by Levante in a shade I have been unable to source in Sydney, are great!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T19:13:53.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

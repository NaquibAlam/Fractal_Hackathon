Plus they let you know if an item is in stock, when it will ship, and when you can expect to receive it. Nothing is more disappointing then ordering something that appears in stock from a merchant then find out after placing the order that it is out of stock and will be several days or weeks before they get more in. B&H Photo does not leave you in the dark on these matters.

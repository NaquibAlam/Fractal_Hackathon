Everything has operated as expected and I am glad I bought from these folks. I would definitely buy from them again. They had the best deal I could find and their review videos were one of the main reasons I bought from them. The videos offer excellent feedback as well as home repair/upgrades help for the do-it-yourselfer like me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:06:22.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

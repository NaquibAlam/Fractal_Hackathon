Got another email about car rentals and found much better deal, selected a car from that second email. Everything still went great even at the airport terminal. Went to parking lot to drive off and lot attendant stated there were no cars fitting my request but she said I could upgrade at not charge to the next larger size at same cost, no upgrade fee, great. No problems while using vehicle. Got back to drop off car and the price changed, not much but still it changed, I asked why and I was informed about this vehicle having a larger fuel tank. Now at the time of picking up the car and giving credit card at counter I had prepaid for the fuel to be refilled at the rental place. Now that I got the \"next larger\" vehicle upgrade being they did not have the size I requested it supposedly had a larger tank and that is why the extra cost to refill tank. However, I was able to go and get price adjusted at booking counter, back down to the original amount at time of getting vehicle from rental. So kudos to the staff on this one. Hope I don't get staff into any hot water. I would have given full five stars but does need a little improvement, but very little.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T09:30:37.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

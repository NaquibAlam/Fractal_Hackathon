The outside housing was damaged slightly from shipping . I took pictures of the damage and sent to Boss. There were no questions asks. They had new parts at my door within 2 weeks. The technical support I needed several times was fast. All the questions and issues I had were answered within the hour. Even after a year and a half I needed tech support again. I had a plate under led screen come out, took a few pics and sent to Boss and they sent pics back on how to fix the issue. Resolved in less than 30 min. Once again I want to thank the entire team at Bosslaser.\nDave\nPennsylvania", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:58:54.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

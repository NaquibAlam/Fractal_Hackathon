When my item came from delivery, which was very quick, it was very well protected in layers of bubble wrap. The box was a little misleading, but of course the product was pre-owned so thats acceptable. Product came with a 2 year warranty, was clean and I also got it for a great price. Overly I had a very good experience with CeX and would reccomend to anyone, especially if on a budget.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:39:14.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Until early this year my business was running cash flow positive due to lenders paying immediately on settlement, now they pay up to 8 weeks later. I needed to find a solution for to pay my referral sources and contractors while this money was held up. My bank was no help and after a quick chat with a business associate I tried Moula. They have been without a doubt the easiest finance option I have ever had anything to do with and with 35 lenders on my panel, that is a big call. 24 hours from application to approval and funds the next day. I will be referring a lot of my commercial clients in need of cash flow or quick business funding.

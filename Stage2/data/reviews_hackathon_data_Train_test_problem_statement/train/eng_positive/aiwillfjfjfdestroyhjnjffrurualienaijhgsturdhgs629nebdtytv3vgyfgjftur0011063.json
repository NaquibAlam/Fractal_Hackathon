Found it very quickly through Thrift Books's extremely nimble Search feature! They not only had it in stock, but at an extremely low price.\nThen I thought, Why not look for some other favorite old titles and authors I hadn't been able to get from my local library system and had more or less despaired of ever seeing? A treasure trove awaited me! So many that I didn't order them all, even with the extremely low prices. Some I may never get around to rereading or reading for the first time, but it's a great pleasure just to have them and know more are available for super-cheap!\nMore obscure stuff in foreign languages, which has been lots of fun. (You get the foreign-language version, the English version, a dictionary and a couple of good grammars...reading works in the original language actually does make a huge difference. Or if you just want to brush up on your French, say: get a French translation of an English original and knock yourself out --- loads of fun! I did \"Sex and the City\" [includes the French you didn't learn in school :) ], \"Bridget Jones' Diary,\" and Stephen King's \"The Dead Zone.\")\nI now look forward to email recommendations based on previous purchases. Not all the books ordered live up to expectations in terms of content, but with prices so low and fast, free shipping with a minimal order such that I can't figure out how they even make any money, who cares? So many books exceed expectations that I am a big, big fan.\nI really like the idea of recycling old used books and Thrift Books's attitude to recyclable packaging material. All orders are received quickly. No order has ever been shorted or mis-billed. Customer Support has been very prompt, courteous, and, most importantly, helpful (my ISP is old and presents some problems, which Customer Service has been able to help me work around).\nThe Search feature's filters allow you to search all kind of topics and authors. The \"Wish List\" is a great tool for storing books that look interesting but you're not quite ready to buy, but, most importantly, alerting you when an out-of-stock book comes in.\nHave I said I'm a big fan? Can I say it enough? Thank you, thank you, thank you! I probably sound like a paid shill for Thrift Books, but I assure you I'm just an ordinary old rank-and-file customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T20:43:52.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

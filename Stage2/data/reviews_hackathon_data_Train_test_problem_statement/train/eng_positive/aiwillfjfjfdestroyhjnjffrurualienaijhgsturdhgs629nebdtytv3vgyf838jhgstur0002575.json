The quality of hair was top notch and color matched BEYOND perfect. There are so many individual pieces of wefts that I cannot wear all of them at one time! I particularly love the 4 clip wefts as those feel super secure and the additional clip allows for better placement in my hair (small head). The 3 clip wefts are just as great, but the 4 clip seems to hold better for me. I absolutely LOVE the 4 individual single clip wefts as they can be placed anywhere for added volume or in conjunction with the other wefts! I've styled my hair various ways (after learning how via the many videos offered by the company on their web site) high pony tail, left down, low side braid, high bun etc... ALL have turned out great after some practice!! Bottom line.... fantastic product, you get EXACTLY what you expect and then some!! Should you be interested in clip in extensions, shop no where else but Lucy Hair!! This IS an honest customer's opinion and I have not received my extensions or experience at a discounted price, nor have I been paid for my review simply a customer whom has been blown away by the product!! Luxy Hair has \"it\" hands down!!! Will purchase again when needed!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T09:13:29.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

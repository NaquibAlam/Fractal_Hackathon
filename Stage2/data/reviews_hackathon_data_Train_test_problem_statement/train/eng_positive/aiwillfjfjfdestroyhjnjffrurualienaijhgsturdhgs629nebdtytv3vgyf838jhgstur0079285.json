I purchased them so that I did not have to glue the frames, but I only had to add the pressure springs and the sawtooth hanger.\nThe only thing that I did not need for assembling the frame was a power drill; it is easy enough to just screw in the pressure springs.\nPackage arrived in a timely manner, and everything was well worth the price.

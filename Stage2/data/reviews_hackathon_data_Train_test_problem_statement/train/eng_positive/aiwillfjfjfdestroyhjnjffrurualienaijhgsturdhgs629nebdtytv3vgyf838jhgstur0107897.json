Typically I will check 4 or 5 major sites like Orbitz, Kayak, Priceline etc..I will also search on less used sites. One thing is clear, FlightHub always has the best deals, with the best flights, bar none. In many cases I found flights that were considerably cheaper. Day in and day out FlightHub outperformed the competition. In fact I paid $100 dollars less, for a better flight based on my critera, using FlightHub's platform. If you are looking for a no BS place to find the best price use FlightHub with confidence!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T08:55:40.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

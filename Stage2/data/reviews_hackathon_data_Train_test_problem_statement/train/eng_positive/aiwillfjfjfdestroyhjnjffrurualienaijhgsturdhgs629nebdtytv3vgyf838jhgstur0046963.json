I was notified of the issue and if it did not arrive by the 25th to let them know. After the postman left, no LTB. I let them know. LTB (Taylor) responded quickly to resolve the issue.\nI recieved the replacement box in a few days but, the items did not match the enclosed menu. I notified Taylor and he took care of me, some items were exchanged or substituted but I came out ahead, in my opinion, which is really all that matters. Terrific customer service! Thanks Taylor!\nRick Williams", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T03:20:03.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I really enjoyed the process from start to finish. I called a few times with questions and each person was very friendly and helpful. The process was very easy and only one designer didn't seem to get what we wanted. Really towards the end it was difficult to choose. I loved the option to poll my coworkers on their favorite design to narrow down our choices to the winner. In the end we purchased 4 designs we couldn't live without. I would definitely use the service in the future for designs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:16:59.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

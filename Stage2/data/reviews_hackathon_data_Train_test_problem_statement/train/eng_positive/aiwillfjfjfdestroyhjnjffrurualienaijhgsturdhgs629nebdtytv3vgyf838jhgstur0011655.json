She has to be the loveliest, most helpful person on this planet.\nWe came to her with some very vague ideas of things we were interested in doing while in Australia but nothing concrete, and based on that she helped us plan what turned out to be the best trip of our lives!\nHer knowledge of Australia is very thorough. Her responses were prompt. She walked us through so many different options of things to do and see from so many different cities. We then took her info and crafted a rough itinerary that she helped refine with bookings and further suggestions.\nWe felt lost when we started planning because, let's face it, Australia is enormous so the task itself is daunting. In no time she made us feel comfortable and confident in our choices/itinerary. Everything went off without a hitch while we were there!\nI will absolutely be recommending Goway and Jenn, to all of my friends looking to travel. She really took the pain out of planning and I can't thank her enough, it was a beautiful, wonderful trip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T19:48:42.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

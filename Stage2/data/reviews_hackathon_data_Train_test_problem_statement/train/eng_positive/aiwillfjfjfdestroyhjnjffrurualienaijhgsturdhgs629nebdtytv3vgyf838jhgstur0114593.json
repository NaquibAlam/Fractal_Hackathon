Thank Goodness as the IRS decided they would fix me and garnesh my wages by 80 percent a week before Christmas (very considerate fo them to go against the order to not garnish). I contacted Optima and they responded very quickly to ensure that practice would stop, then and there. Too bad they didn't give it back 'right away'.\nThier Team dove into my return problems and fixed them right away and to my surprise THE IRS OWED ME a considerable amount of money from the withholdings and write offs that I was entitled to.\nI can tell you behind the scenes Mr Santiago earned his keep witht the company as he battled the IRS and insisted on money being returned that the IRS stated 'Past the the time limit for return'\nI was very pleased with the representation by Optima and would highly recommend the pease of mind by hiring them to deal with the profeesional confiscaters at the IRS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T04:47:31.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

No More!!! I have used Currency Fair twice now and will continue to do so for all my transfers. Their exchange rates are highly competitive and each transaction charge was only $4 , but it's the speed and efficiency of the transfers that blow any bank out of the water, I would and do highly recommend you give these guys a try, trust me you will never look back and you will save money with every transaction made and get the best rates too.

I was thrilled with responses when I made requests about getting started. First delivery of checkered box went as promised. I loved putting on the apron after a hectic day at the office - transitioning into a fun cooking experience.\nReally enjoyed trying new ingredients not found in regular market in Modesto and the food was delicious. Directions were very easy to follow and all ingredients were fresh. My husband liked the meals, too.\nI highly recommend Munchery to lighten your day and expand cooking horizons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:28:54.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

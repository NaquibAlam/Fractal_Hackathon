My sister has a mix breed with lots of coon hound in him. One of mine and hers will bolt through an open door and head for parts unknown if given the chance. I've had to search high and low for a dog in the past. Now I am too old and tired for wild goose chases. I searched the market for a tacking device to serve my concerns. I have a vehicle with LoJack. When I found TRACTIVE I realized it's like LoJack for dogs! If the day comes when one or both of the dogs manages to run off I will be able to find them easily. I discovered the heavier duty unit has a longer battery life (fewer rechargings). Went through customer service to do my upgrades. They were very helpful and got me fixed up! I don't usually do reviews but I love my dogs and want them safe. I know others who love their pets feel the same. This device is a godsend. I used to keep horses. If I had Tractive then I would use it on trail rides so people could find me if I didn't make it home. I can think of MANY uses for TRACTIVE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T06:36:45.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

As a Melburnian resident interstate, I absolutely love my (women's) Parkville and Collins watches which keep excellent (and beautiful) time - the fine detailing, including casing and watchband,is superb and of good quality. Like the men's watches, the appearance is \"conservative quality\". - I am just awaiting MWC to decide to produce a few zany coloured, but same quality leather, watchbands, ie RED!! MWC, please let me know when you have one!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:17:54.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

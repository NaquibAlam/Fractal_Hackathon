After a few days of updates I got a little tired of so many messages in my Inbox, but in retrospect I was very glad. I became aware that the prices for our itinerary were starting to climb, so I changed the date slightly and set another alert and another departure city. In effect I ended up with a range of dates and prices and was able to lock in at a very good price just by leaving and returning a day later in each case. I also found the options very clearly laid out so it wasn't hard to pick the best itinerary, dates and price for us. Very satisfied. My only caveat is that if you choose not have insurance (I have other coverage) you have to decline in two different places or it is automatically applied to your total.\nI also liked the connection to booking.com with which I am very familiar and was able to reserve a hotel room that meets our needs, that works out better for what we wanted than the one I had picked myself by scrolling directly through booking.com.\nIn summary I found the whole process very straightforward and quick. Now we just have to wait and see if the flights live up to our expectations. But if they don't it won't be FlightHub's fault.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T17:25:38.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The website is excellent, easy to navigate and to use. It was easy to set up our business account and the transparency of the fees and rates each time we do a transfer (EUR or US$) is marvellous. The transfers are much quicker than via our bank. Also we no longer have to use an intermediary bank in the USA to route our payments. I spoke to TransferWise customer services several times with queries before we used the service and each time found them very helpful - it was great to actually speak to a person and not have to go through automated answer options to do so. My only slight concern is the use of Captcha (select street sign images etc) when logging in sometimes. I often get error messages with Captcha connections generally on the internet and worry I may not be able to log in to our account to make payments at the time I need to. However, I guess this process helps to make the site more secure so will probably just have to see how it goes and hope for the best. Overall I would recommend TransferWise to any small business. It's good to see such an innovative platform challenging \"the big Four\" banks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:36:40.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

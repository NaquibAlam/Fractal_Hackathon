Prior to Bitbond I invested on numerous other p2p platforms and learned quite a lot. This has stood me in good stead here, as I can avoid some of the mistakes beginners always make, like investing large amounts in a few high-risk loans.\nIf you're a beginner, use Bitbond with caution and start off with small investments across many loans. Try to stay true to your risk appetite and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:56:05.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

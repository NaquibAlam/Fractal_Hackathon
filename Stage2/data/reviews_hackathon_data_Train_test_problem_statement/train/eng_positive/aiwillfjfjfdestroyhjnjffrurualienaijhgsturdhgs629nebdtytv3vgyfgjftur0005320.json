I stumbled across your site accidentally and imagine my surprise when I found the same dress my daughter fell in love with at another store (selling for $500), and I found it on your site for $150, including shipping! The dress was on our doorstep in less than a week too! It was exactly what she wanted! Having 3 daughters, I will definitely be buying from you again and I have already recommended you to many of my friends and my daughters' friends' parents.

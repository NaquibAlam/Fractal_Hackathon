We walked in having gone to many other carpet stores and not being able to find a carpet we loved. We spoke to Will who instantly started to take us around the store showing us only carpet pieces that matched what we wanted. He did not pressure us or try to tell us what we wanted. From that point forward he was with us every step of the way and always made sure we were updated and answered every little question we could come up with. On the day of the installers showed up on time and were very professional and pleasant to have in our home. Even when an unexpected power outage set us back, they took it in stride and worked around it as best they could. This company did an amazing job for us from beginning to end and we will be recommending them to all of our friends!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T09:58:01.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

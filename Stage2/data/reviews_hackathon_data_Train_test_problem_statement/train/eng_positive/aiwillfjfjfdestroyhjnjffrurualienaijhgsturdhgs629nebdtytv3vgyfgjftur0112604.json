Having used three other international cell phone service providers in the past, I can honestly say that OneSimCard is the most reliable and affordable service provider I have used. The service worked perfectly on my trip to the UK, and I particularly enjoyed having the option to purchase a data package. Checking my balance was straightforward, and the OneSimCard app helped with dialing international numbers. I'd recommend this company to anyone and plan to use them on my next trip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:19:42.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

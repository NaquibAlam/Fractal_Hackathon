Our first experience of Trusted Housesitters was brilliant. After 3 years we were finally able to take a break knowing our animals would be cared for and comfortable in their own surroundings. Our House Sitter was fantastic and we've make a new friend too. It was such a relief - we've already booked our holiday for 2018 and will be using Trusted House Sitters again next year.

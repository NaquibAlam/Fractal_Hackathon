We went with Quasar on the recommendation of friends. We were so pleased with our experience. Our two guides, Kristina and Sam, were great. Victor, the captain, and Steve, the cruise director, were outstanding. In fact all the staff and crew were terrific. Our cabin was spacious - queen size bed and large bathroom- with a porthole. The ship was very stable- no sea sickness. The food was excellent. The outside decks were comfortable and the hot tub after returning from snorkeling was especially welcome. All of the above made for a very compatible and happy group of guests. Lastly what we all came for, the animals and the geology, was very professionally explained and shown to us. I felt I understood why and how all the unique characteristics of the Galapagos came about. All in all a marvelous learning adventure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T22:42:48.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

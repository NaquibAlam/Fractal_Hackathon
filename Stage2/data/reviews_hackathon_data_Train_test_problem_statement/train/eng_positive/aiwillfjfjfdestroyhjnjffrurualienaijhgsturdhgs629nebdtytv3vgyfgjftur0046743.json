The Zicasso site asks for some basic information about your desired cities and activities. Once I entered the information, I was referred on the same day to two travel agencies located in Germany. I was able to review their recommendations and choose one to work with. We were so pleased with the agency that planned our tour that I once again used Zicasso to find a travel agency in Italy where we will take our granddaughter in summer. Again we had two agencies to evaluate and we chose one that seemed to have the best fit to our ideas.\nIf you want to find an agency to plan your overseas vacation, you will be pleased with your choices. Our expectations were exceeded at every step of the planning and actual vacation experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:14:23.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

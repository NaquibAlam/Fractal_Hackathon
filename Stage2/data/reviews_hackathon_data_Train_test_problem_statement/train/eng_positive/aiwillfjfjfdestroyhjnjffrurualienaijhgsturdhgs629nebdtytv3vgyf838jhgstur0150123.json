Suddenly, I could no longer stream my favorite TV news programs. After a couple of email inquiries with SaferVPN tech support that I was unable to execute, Robert Sage not only tried to walk me through the trouble shooting via Skype but even took over my computer briefly to trouble shoot a particularly sticky aspect of the repair. He did it on a Saturday. And he did it promptly and efficiently. I am a most appreciative client of SaferVPN.\nThank you Robert and Thank you SaferVPN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:50:27.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

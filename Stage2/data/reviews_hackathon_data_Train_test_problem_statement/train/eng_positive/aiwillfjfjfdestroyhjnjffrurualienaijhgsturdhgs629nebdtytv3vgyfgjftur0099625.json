Turned around Quote: s ASAP and talked me through the design considerations considering we are new to pallet racking in our warehouse. didn't push stuff we didn't need and gave honest info about products as we were looking used and ultimately went new. I also picked up and their loading dept assisted greatly in making sure we had everything and got it loaded properly. Competitively priced for both new and used.\nGreat for a small to medium sized business and wouldn't hesitate to recommend! Will definitely use again when we build our next warehouse this summer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T15:51:33.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

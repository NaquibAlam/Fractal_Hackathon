The last time I called, I was so frightened about something that was wrong with my goldendoodle named Charlotte. She had a gigantic wart that had grown on her ear and it just looked awful and I was beside myself. The young woman I talked to was so kind and so understanding and said \"don't you worry Chantal we will take care of this and your Charlotte will be fine.\" Suddenly, I felt 100% better and indeed they did take care of it.\nI signed up for auto deposit which by the way, is a very good thing to do and they had refunded my money for my claim in less than seven days. I know I sound like I work for pets best but I assure you I don't. I live in Sun Valley Idaho and I do dog rescue and hospice care. They are simply fabulous.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:26:42.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

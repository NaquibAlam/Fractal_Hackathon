Every order is packed well and includes a card of the person packing my order. To me this shows integrity and pride in there work to say \"I did this.\" The quality of the equipment is excellent according to a long time member of my local bee keepers association. I do not know if the PMTC is a large company but they seem to have a small town family feel. I've called the PMTC once and the person answering my call was polite and professional. She answered my questions without having to ask someone else and the best part she new who I was when I introduced myself. Yes, just like your own mom and pop store down the road.

One in Liverpool, one in London. One set of tickets was easy--they were sent via email and I was able to download and print ahead of time. The other set was a bit trickier due to the ticket system in Liverpool. However, the customer service department did a great job keeping in touch with me along the way and getting the tickets delivered to my hotel the day prior to the game. My only criticism would be that I didn't understand--until after the fact--that it might have been difficult to deliver the type of tickets rec'd to my hotel in London, prior to departing for Liverpool--and that part might have been more difficult. I just don't know. Fortunately, despite the short time window between my arrival in Liverpool and the Match time, I asked for Liverpool Hotel delivery. In the end that seemed to make more sense for them as well as for me--I just didn't know that fact when the company Football Ticket Net was communicating with me about a UK delivery address. They came through on everything. Tickets were great for both games.\nOne other comment. My husband ordered one set of tickets using his email, and I used my email to order the second set. Despite emailing customer service multiple times with both order numbers, and asking them to please communicate with me and my email, they continued to communicate with his email re: the one set of tickets. I sort of understand that need, but at the least, customer service could have added me to his email communications since my credit card name and number was verified for that order and I clearly identified the two orders and the two order numbers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:57:15.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

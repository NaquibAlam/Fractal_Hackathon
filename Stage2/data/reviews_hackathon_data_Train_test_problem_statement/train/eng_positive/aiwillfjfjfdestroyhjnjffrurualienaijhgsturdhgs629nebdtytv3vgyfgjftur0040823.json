After I applied & sent my ID, I tried to complete the application on 2/3/17 but was having problems. All the links did not appear on the page. I wanted to get this done as soon as possible because I am starting a new job & want to have my paycheck deposited in my Goldmoney account. I hit the link for help & within minutes I got a reply from Craig. I tried the link but it failed. I tried help again & again within minutes I got another email with a link. I tried again & same result. This happened 4 or 5 times. Every time Craig responded very quickly. After the last attempt he apologized from the problems & just set me up himself. The card did not come yet but I am eager to start buying & spending gold off my Goldmoney account. I was a bit concerned how Customer Service would be if I ever had a problem, but now all doubts are removed.\nThanks James Turk, Peter Schiff, Goldmoney & thanks Craig!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:33:30.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

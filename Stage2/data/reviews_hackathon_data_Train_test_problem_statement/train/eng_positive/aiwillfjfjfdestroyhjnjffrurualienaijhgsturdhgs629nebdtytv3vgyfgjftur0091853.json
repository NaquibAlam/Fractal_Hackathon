Fortunately they were packaged well in bubble wrap and boxed in firm cardboard which offered protection. The blinds work well, look great and are well finished. However, the chains are too short and are approximately 2/3 the length of the blind, so I need to stretch up to reach and the blinds need to be lowered slowly with several pulls. This is more awkward with the kitchen blind which is above the work top as I have to go on tip toes and stretch over to reach. I find the threads at the back through the hoops are flimsy and came loose easily when adjusting the blinds when fitting. The blinds fit well into the brackets but are too difficult to remove. Overall I'm pleased with service and recommend blinds 2 go but there needs to be an option for chain length.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:59:22.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

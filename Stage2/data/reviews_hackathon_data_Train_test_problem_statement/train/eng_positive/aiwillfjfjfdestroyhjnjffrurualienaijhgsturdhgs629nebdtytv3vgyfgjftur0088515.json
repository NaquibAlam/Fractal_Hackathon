First, I had to get beyond the uncomfortable feeling about having complete strangers live in our home. Second, the website originated in the U.K. and we live in the U.S. Was it a difference in culture that explained my unease? And last of all, we live in a small, one-stoplight town in northern Nevada. Would anyone even be interested?? But I LOVED there idea that Loki, our 12-year-old German shepherd, and Jackson a young and precocious cat, could remain comfortable in their home while we took a snowbird vacation for 2 weeks to sunny Mexico. So.... first, I emailed 'Help' for more information. I was assured the sitters were amazing individuals and took hold care of both pets and property. I've actually traveled successfully numerous times with Airbnb hosts and have toyed with the idea of listing rooms in our home.... This would be a great introduction for me. I had just over a month to prepare and if no one inquired, I had a back up plan. My niece offered to take Loki and neighbors would check up on Jackson. To my surprise, there were 4 enquiries within 24 hours of my post! And even more surprising, they were all AMAZING! Three were from states quite distant from us and the fourth from Eastern Canada. We choose a couple with high interest in the outdoors - there's a LOT of that here. They also had friends to visit about an hour and a half away. They arrived in the afternoon before our early morning flight so we had some time to become more acquainted, although we'd kept in touch as they traveled across the U.S. I felt completely comfortable, like they were good friends, by the time we left. Steve and Jayne kept us informed of their activities with our pets, sending a pic or two of Loki on a hike or Jackson napping. When we returned, there were flowers and a Welcome-home/Thankyou card on the kitchen table, and happy, extremely relaxed pets to greet us, with no signs of separation anxiety (following us EVERYWHERE, every waking moment) Our home was tidy and spotless, as we had left it two weeks before. What else can I say, but that I am a believer in this wonderful concept and absolutely SOLD. I've told several friends about this pet/house sitting discovery but also to wait until we returned for a follow-up from me. I am happily spreading the good news far and wide!

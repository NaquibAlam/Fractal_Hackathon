He took me right to what I asked him I wanted to see. Did not get it that day. Show my husband picture of it and then I came back into the store Thursday, Heath, was not there (day off). That's when Sara, helped me. She remembered me and I said I wanted Heath to get the sale and she was so nice. She is new in your store and I know she is going to make you a good sale person. It's nice to walk in a show room with people that do not bug you while you look around. Tell Sara and Heath thanks again for their help. I'll be back to look for recliner chairs. Thanks for having a great sale. I guess that's another reason I ended up buying from Home Zone. Keep the sale coming and your sale people happy, because that's what made a sale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:00:47.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

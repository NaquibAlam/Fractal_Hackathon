We have never done a trip like this so Lindsey directed us through the entire process. We tried going through a AAA travel agent and through Costco Travel and he found us our best bang for our buck we feel. The only bummer was I had a $100 off voucher that I forgot to tell him about before booking and by then there was nothing I could do.But that isn't going to ruin our trip!

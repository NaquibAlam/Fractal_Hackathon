I am a return buyer for years now and each lambie I have purchased is dearly loved by its owner. My grandson, now nearly 14 was so attached to his, it shrunk or was rubbed away by him down to something very small. I cant speak more highly of this company, my experience being that it is a very caring company giving each and every customer, a smooth and fair price purchase experience.

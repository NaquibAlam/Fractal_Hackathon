Trusted Housitters is exactly that. It matches people wanting their house and pets looking after while away with animal lovers who want to travel and live in a home as opposed to a hotel.\nThe concept is good but it still needs to be executed well and the website and service is outstanding. We have used the service 3 times while we've been away and had 3 fantastic sitters who have all been lovely, friendly and most importantly, great with our two dogs. The peace of mind it gives yyou cannot be underestimated.\nWe have regularly recommended the service to our friends and family and I think that says all you need to know. It's brilliant and that's all that can be said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:39:29.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

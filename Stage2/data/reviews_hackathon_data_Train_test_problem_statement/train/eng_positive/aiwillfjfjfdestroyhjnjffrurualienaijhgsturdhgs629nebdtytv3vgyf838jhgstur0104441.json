I have bought so many books that otherwise I have told myself were just too expensive because they are so cheap here. I am amazed by the quality when I get them as well. For $3 or less I am expecting a pretty well worn copy to be honest but so many of them come looking like they are right out of the bookstore! The only potential complaint would be that the shipping takes longer than an Amazon, but the cost savings is absolutely worth the extra few days wait for the books in the mail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T22:50:00.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

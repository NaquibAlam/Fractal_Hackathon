One company wanted me to change the logo and used the words only and not the artwork, because they said the logo's resolution wasn't high enough. Another local company was just too expensive. CustomUSB's price was good and I didn't have to change a thing. My USB drives arrived before the date I needed them and everyone at our conference loved the graphics. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T13:38:56.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

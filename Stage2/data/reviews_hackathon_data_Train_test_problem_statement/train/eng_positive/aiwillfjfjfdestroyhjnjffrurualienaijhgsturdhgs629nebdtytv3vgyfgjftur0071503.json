I tripped the thermostat that I had previously set at 15 degrees up to a snug 20 but nothing happened.\nIts 5pm on a Friday night, the forecast is for snow when I phone CORGI who after a short interrogation say that I can expect a call back from the engineer within 24 hours.\nI thought that as it was Friday I would be lucky to hear anything before Monday and started to get the log burner going.\n6pm telephone call from the engineer who said he would be half an hour - on the dot of 6.30 he arrived and by 7.00 pm he was gone - job done tested and working just fine.\nNow thats what I paid for and am so pleased with the service I have taken the trouble to type this up. Excellent, first class in all respects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:17:18.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

She was a fully developed and gorgeous little girl. I couldn't function, let alone fathom having to bury my only baby. I tried to order her marker dozens of times, but I would always breakdown crying. I finally tried to hold it together long enough to order it, and I succeeded. I selected every word and design. I didn't see an option to add extras, so in the shipping comments, I asked if they could add a butterfly above her name. I refer to and view my baby as my little eternal gorgeous butterfly. To my amazement the proof was beyond perfect and the butterfly was there. I'm beyond Thankful and happy. I couldn't give them a more perfect review.

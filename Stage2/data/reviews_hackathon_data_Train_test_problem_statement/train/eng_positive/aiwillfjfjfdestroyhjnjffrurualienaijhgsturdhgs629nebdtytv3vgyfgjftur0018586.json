Music by the original artists--just the way we heard them on the radio. Cassettes arrived in factory condition and the music quality was fabulous! I will absolutely order from them again! The only con I have is--one tape did not arrive(I was not charged for it)and I couldn't tell from the invoice if it is back ordered or simply not available.

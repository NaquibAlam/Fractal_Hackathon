I couldn't source a pre-owned one in Ireland and was delighted to see it on Watchfinder. I exchanged two of my existing watches towards the new one. The WF process from start to finish was amazing. My sales advisor, Tom Holland, was prompt and thorough with his information and got me a deal with relative ease. I spoke with him on the phone a couple of times and he was really helpful and reassuring - nothing was a problem. The emails at every stage were great but I also could see every step on the website. I was a bit concerned dealing from outside the UK but I needn't have been. The process from when I made the deal to when I received the new watch was a bit over a week. I couldn't recommend WF highly enough. Excellent in every way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:25:22.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

So I started researching. I found the process of trying to secure Quote: s from various companies overwhelming. Then I found Quotacy, I think through nerdwallet.com. Quotacy allowed me to get Quote: s from most of the major companies all in one place. In the end, my husband and I ended up with policies from different companies because Quotacy worked to find the company that would give us each the best price and value. My agent Tanya was very helpful over the phone. Then a medical person came directly to my home to do the health exam, which was incredibly convenient for me. I can actually rest much easier now still hoping that nothing bad happens to me or my husband, but at least knowing that our survivors will be well taken care if one or both of us dies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:51:48.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

And it comes well wrapped. Third time i ordered free shipping and it doesnt come with a tracking number so I don't know how much it took to arrive.\nAlso I have a good experience with custom service, they were really nice and took the time to check what I asked them and solved problems.\nYou have to be smart to choose where you buy from tho. There's stores that have their own sties, own models wearing the clothes, and all so you know those are legit. I ddint have any problem with the products I bought!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T11:09:12.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

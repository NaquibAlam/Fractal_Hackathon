With the majority of books being under 4 dollars, I assemble an order of 3 or 4 books at a time and my orders rarely exceed 13 dollars. That in itself is amazing, but it gets better with free shipping for orders over 10 bucks. Double awesome! I also enroll in their reading rewards, which simply means that for every 50 bucks o spend I get 5 dollars off my next order. Sounds like not that much, but that's basically a book and a half, for free! I recommend them to everyone. There was one time that a book I ordered was missing pages making it unreadable. I contacted customer service and they credited my card for the book, no need to send it back to them.

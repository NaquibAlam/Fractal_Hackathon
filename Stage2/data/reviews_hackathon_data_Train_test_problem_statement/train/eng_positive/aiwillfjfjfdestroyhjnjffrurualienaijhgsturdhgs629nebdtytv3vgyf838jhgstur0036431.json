I have a post office box only so we always have issues with shipping packages to us. I had someone from TicketCity, an actual person email me and ask me for a new location to send it to because they cannot deliver to a PO Box. I then continued to ask her about the delivery time etc and she responded within minutes. They seem to have GREAT customer service. It is so nice in a time when computer responses are so common to hear from a person. I received my tickets within 3 days even though when I ordered it said it could take up to 2 weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T05:44:44.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

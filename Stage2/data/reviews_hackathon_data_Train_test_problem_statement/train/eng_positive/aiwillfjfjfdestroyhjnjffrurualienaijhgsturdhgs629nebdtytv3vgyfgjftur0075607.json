We had just moved in to the area with very little furniture, so we purchased an entire bedroom set with king mattress, and a couch/love seat with coffee table and two end tables. We both love the mattress, completely worth the money so far, as well as the furniture. The coffee table veneer where the feet touch the carpet is a little weak and has pulled away a bit, but nothing bad. Easy to put together, and super fast delivery. The couches are fantastic, and we got them discounted because we wanted them immediately, so we got the floor models. The only other aspect was the customer service: the guys were very attentive, in my personal taste, a little too much. They obviously want to make the sale which feels a little pushy or perhaps not as trustworthy, but, as I've said, I love the furniture, so it all worked out. And they were all very nice, just a little too obvious about their attempts to sell ASAP, for my own tastes.\nOverall, very positive experience, and we'll probably be back to look at dining sets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:07:57.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I chose Brian Gavin with care, this being my first large international purchase. I wanted a diamond that did not compromise on cut and, just as much, I wanted it to be strong fluorescent blue. Found! A year later I chose a setting and, finally, now I can wear my beautiful Brian Gavin Blue pendant.\nI chose a local jeweller who gasped on first sight of the stone. It wasn't the largest diamond but the quality was obvious! There is nothing like the sparkle of a perfect cut.\nSince then, I went to visit the Electric Ladyland Fluorescent Art Museum in Amsterdam. It was near Anne Frank House so my boyfriend and I quickly located it and went in to discover the fluorescent art and the history and science behind it. While there, my boyfriend mentioned my diamond and asked the guide if he'd like to see it. I took it off and he put it under fluorescent light and said he'd never seen one like this! My diamond was a very strong blue in his light. Next he called the other museum visitors to have a look!\nThanks to the Brian Gavin Diamond team, I felt immediate trust and security in ordering a stone from them and am very glad I did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T12:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:40:03.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

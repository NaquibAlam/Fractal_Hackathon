No less than 20 hours later a mini cot bed arrived in flat pack form to my office.. (The ability to use an alternative shipping address is always a bonus!)\nThe packaging was complete and care had been taken to ensure no damage would deflate our initial joy of Kiddies Kingdom's very competitive price structure. The build was completed in less than 30 minutes that night (Bravo OBaby on an excellent product and simple design!) and we our now the proud owners of our first born's first cot bed..\nIt may have been fluke or luck but as a manufacturer, retailer and consumer myself, I cannot fault the service or speed at which Kiddies Kingdom completed my order and have no doubt that I will be using them again in future as my journey as a first time father looking for competitive prices and fantastic products steps up a gear in the third trimester..\nYour sincerely,\nA grateful father to be with growing online needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T10:46:14.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I've found the U.S. sites to very expensive for booking Cuba due to political stipulations. So when I found a very good rate through Gala, I booked it. It wasn't until finding another \"to good to be true\" rate for a U.S. chain hotel that I became skeptical. After researching GalaHotels.com on the web, I was growing terrified that I may have made a terrible mistake. However, after calling the Cuban hotel directly with the number provided on my Prepaid Voucher, my fears were put to rest when the hotel employee verified that our reservation was in fact already there and that everything was in order! As far as the overall hotel rating is concerned, that has nothing to do with Gala, as they are only the booking agents. I will follow up with an update when we return from Cuba in April.

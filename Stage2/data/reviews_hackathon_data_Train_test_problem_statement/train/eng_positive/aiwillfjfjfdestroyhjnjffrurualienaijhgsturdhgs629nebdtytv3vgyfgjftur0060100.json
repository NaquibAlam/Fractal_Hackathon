With other flight websites, I had to re-try booking 3 times and it still didn't work! Flighthub is reliable and always searches to give you the best deals and options. I love that they include ways to save on your trip. Highly recommend booking through Flighthub for your next vacation!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:51:12.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They offer all styles of music, as well as DVDs of older movies and television shows. Most retailers of music and videos (if you can even find one in today's market) focus on the music and movies that are the most popular (i.e.., those that appeal to the under-thirty demographic). They offer less of the older, back-catalog titles that are more likely to appeal to folks who are looking for 50s, 60s, or 70s music. Oldies.com offers lots of this kind of music. My recent order was delivered promptly ( I commend them for using FedEx Smart Post, too.) I am very pleased with my purchases from Oldies.com.

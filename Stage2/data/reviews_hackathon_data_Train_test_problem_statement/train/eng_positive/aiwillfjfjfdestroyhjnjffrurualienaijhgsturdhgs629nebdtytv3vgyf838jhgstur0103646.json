My husband and I visited 3 seperate locations including the Auburn Hills location 3 times before making a purchase. Just a suggestion but you may consider educating your sales people a bit more. Once each of the salespeople showed us the most expensive mattress in the store and said everything else was junk we decoded to leave. As you could imagine, we left without making a purchase since we weren't in the market to buy a six thousand dollar mattress. Salespeople should be able to state the pros and cons of each item, not simply state their opinion on products which seem to be based solely off how much commission they will receive for that sale. Apparently any sale, isn't better than no sale!\nThere were two men, not sales people, who were very helpful in our final trip to the Auburn Hills location. I think they may have worked in the warehouse. They went above and beyond to help us and make our final shopping trip a successful one. A big thanks!\nThe delivery men were very professional. They were timely and curteous and they even made sure I saw that the adjustable base worked correctly before leaving. Thanks for the professionalism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:07:37.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The books I have gotten so far are old with respect to publishing date, but are in perfect condition and I bought them at low prices, for the most part.\nI wish there would be a way to put items in the shopping cart and then choose to which address each would go to one by one instead of having to divide up the order to send to two or more addresses. I would also like more clarity on the book I am getting, like if the different cover means it is not the copy I wanted. There are also several typos on the site which makes ordering confusing. For instance, I wanted \"The Survivor\" by Jack Eisner, and the site lists it as the Survivor of the Holocaust by Jack Risner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:51:19.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

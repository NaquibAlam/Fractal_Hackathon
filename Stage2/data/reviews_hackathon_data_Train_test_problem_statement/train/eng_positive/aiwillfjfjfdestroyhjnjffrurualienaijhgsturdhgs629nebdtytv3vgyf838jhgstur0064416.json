Before making a decision, I ran a Google search to see if I could secure a better price. Most of the more affordable options were overseas, European vendors. The majority had questionable reviews. When I looked at Giarre.com, I was impressed by the long history of positive reviews and decided to drop an email to test the legitimacy of the company. After a quick reply and further email exchanges, I placed an order for the Orgreen frames and lenses. The total price was half of what the Seattle vendor was asking! Leonardo sent regular updates and within 5 weeks I had my glasses. Am already considering ordering a second pair from Giarre. Customer service could not have been better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:34:52.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

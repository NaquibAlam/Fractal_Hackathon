We were going on a 5-week, overseas trip and were at a loss on what to do with our beloved Maddie. Boarding her for that long was not an option, and we were ready to bite the bullet and hire someone to stay in our house. Enter Trusted Housesitters! I uploaded a picture of Maddie (the cutest Australian Shepherd EVER!!) - wrote a description of our needs - and within an hour started getting prospects. I finally had to cut off the request after 2 days because I got so many excellent responses from around the world. After carefully reviewing the applicants, I picked one, interviewed her, and we agreed on the sit. It worked just great, and I will definitely use this wonderful service again when the need arises.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:40:19.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

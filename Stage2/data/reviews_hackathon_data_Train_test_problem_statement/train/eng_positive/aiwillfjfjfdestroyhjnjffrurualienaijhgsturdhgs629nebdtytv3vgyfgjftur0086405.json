Website is great, ordering is easy, all things needed to sell a product online. What i would like comment on is the service after the sale. I purchased something that was time sensitive. I needed it quickly and that is what i got. The service dept was great (Genevieve in particular). They kept me up to date on shipping and followed through on what they had promised. 5 stars!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T18:27:52.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

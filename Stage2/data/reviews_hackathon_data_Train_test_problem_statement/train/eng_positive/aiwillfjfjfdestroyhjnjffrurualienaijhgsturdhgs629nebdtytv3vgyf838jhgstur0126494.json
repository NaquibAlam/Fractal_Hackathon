After months and months of high turnover with employees who just don't care, I started to use ZipRecruiter and another service called Talent Sorter for all of my hiring needs and between the two I have had unbelievable interviews with great applicants who are serious about the positions posted and my turnover has decreased significantly. The ONLY problem I have with ZipRecruiter is that they pull resumes from a pool based on keywords and so you never know if the applicant is really interested in the position or if ZipRecruiter just put the resume on your dashboard. You really start to notice the pulling of resumes when 40% of the resumes don't match the licensed position you are hiring for. Other than this one issue with ZipRecruiter, I would recommend this service to any employer, small or big!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T05:17:02.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

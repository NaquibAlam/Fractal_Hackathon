These two have obviously worked together for some time as there was quite a lot of humorous banter between them which I liked. Anyhow, working as a team, they got my two tyres replaced swiftly, and Steve let me know additionaly that my rear brake pads would need replacing soon which was a nice touch.\nA great team, great service and at a great price. Thanks T.O.T.D. I would have no qualms in recommending you.\nGlenn Langford", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:07:33.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Well made and looked amazing on. The only thing I would recommend is order your true size. I measured my daughter and going by the sizing chart she should of been in size 8. She wears a size 12 so I took a chance and ordered size 12 thinking if it was too big I could have it altered. The size 12 fit PERFECT! So therefore I'm glad I didn't order the size 8 or would have had to send back. I Will totally buy her prom dresses from here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:45:10.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

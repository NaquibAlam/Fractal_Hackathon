After a couple of hours, he texted, I'm really feeling this in my calves. At the end of the first day he texted, \"my calves are really sore - in a good way\". I had to tease him, \"so much for being in great shape - crossfitter. :-)\"\nAlso he was the envy of his co-workers, who couldn't wait to try his Wurf board. Those who have, have loved it.\nThe conclusion - he loves his Wurf board and \"will use the heck out of this\".

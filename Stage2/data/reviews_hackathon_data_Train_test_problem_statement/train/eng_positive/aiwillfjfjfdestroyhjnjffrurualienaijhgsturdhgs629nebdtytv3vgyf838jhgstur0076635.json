Staples said they no longer carried them. I googled the HP cartridge we needed and found Inkfarm. Liking the name and their website, we gave them a call. Very nice, very professional, and very helpful. Guaranteed that we could return the ink if it didn't work. The cartridges came quickly, they were reasonably priced, and they worked beautifully in my mother's old printer.

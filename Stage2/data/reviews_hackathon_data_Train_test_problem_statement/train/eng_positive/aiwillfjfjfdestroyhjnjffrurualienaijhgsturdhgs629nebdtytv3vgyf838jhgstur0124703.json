This is our one and only criticism - we weren't told who our courtesy bus was with. We were looking for Rentalcars.com, and then were looking for Ace Rentals (who our car was with). It was only because another friendly bus-driver (plenty of them aren't!) told us that our courtesy bus was Busy Beaver that we were able to get to our car minutes before they closed for the day and we wouldn't have been able to pick up our car!!\nWe had seen 2 Busy Beaver buses stop, pick up people and go right in front of us.\nApart from that one thing, the people at Ace were fantastic. Polite and efficient and our car was wonderful. It was clean, newish and economical to run, comfortable and was just perfect really.\nDropping car back was seamless.\nWe would not hesitate to book again using this service - especially now that we know which bus to get on!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T02:41:27.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

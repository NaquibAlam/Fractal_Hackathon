All the modules were challenging, and well presented. I have worked with plants in my gardens in Southern California for many years, but recently retired from full time employment, and am looking for a new career in the garden design business. Although the native plants featured in the modules were the ones present in the United Kingdom, I can take that information and translate it into focusing (mostly), on designing gardens utilizing the trees and plants that are native to Southern California. The construction materials noted in the hardscaping sections described throughout the modules are pretty universal, so the information found in them are applicable here as well. I thoroughly enjoyed working my way through the modules of training, learned a lot more about the physical nature of garden design, but maybe more importantly, about the \"behind the scenes\" planning that is also very necessary to setting up a successful business; this includes the business plan, financial, and insurance aspects of garden design. Thanks again to Blue Mountain Training for providing this course", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:49:01.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

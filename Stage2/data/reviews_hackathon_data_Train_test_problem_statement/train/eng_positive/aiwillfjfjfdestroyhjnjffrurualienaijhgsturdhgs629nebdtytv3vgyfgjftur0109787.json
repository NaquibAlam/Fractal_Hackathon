Ridgmar mall area of Fort Worth. He was pleasant, professional and knowledgable of furniture. Jeff the manager was very pleasant as well. This store is great! I'd recommend Heath to my peeps! Very clean and organized store. Not at all stuffed with too much product. Very easy to picture furniture in my home and easy to walk through all areas. Thank you Heath and Jeff for making my decision pleasant!

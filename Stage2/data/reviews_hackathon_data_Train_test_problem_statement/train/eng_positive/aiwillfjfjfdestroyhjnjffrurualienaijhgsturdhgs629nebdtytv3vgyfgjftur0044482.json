Only buy the same product each time but would like some more info on the non genuine cartridges offered. For example, my Canon Inks are archival, are the non genuine? My XL Canon Inks seem to last ages - will I get the same mileage out of the non genuine? As an artist, quality is important but I always like to save money if I can. However, my genuine Canon Inks are def. cheaper through Inkstation. Maybe Inkstation needs a quick star rating customer review page on ink quality. Think how helpful that would be for people considering buying a new printer. At the end of the day, for most people it is the recurring cost of inks that make a printer successful or not. :-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T20:13:25.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

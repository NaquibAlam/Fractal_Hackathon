To support development of a custom barcode technology for a client, I contacted Toptal for C++ programming of the barcode technology, and development of Windows-based graphic demo programs.\nToptal Manager Pedro Alves Nogueira rapidly understood that I was looking for the highest level of programming and technical support, and assigned to me Dr Sasa Mrvos in Zagreb. Sasa not only understands and quickly delivers what I want programmed, but also understands the engineering and mathematical basis of what I am doing. He went on to provide me a C++ barcode decoding package which will save my client thousands of dollars in software licensing fees. Through Toptal I have found a R&D colleague as well as a superb programming support.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:16:53.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

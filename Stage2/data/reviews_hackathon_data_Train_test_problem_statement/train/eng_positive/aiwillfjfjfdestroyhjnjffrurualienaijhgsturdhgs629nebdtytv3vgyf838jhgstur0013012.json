The corners are reinforced and the edges stitched very securely. There are plenty of elastic stays to hold music and the two folder pockets are more like pouches. They will expand as you break in the leather like material the entire thing is made out of. The elastic for the pencil, extremely secure even for a full length pencil. The see through pocket will be awesome for order of program information etc... It comes with a binder that easily can be taken out. It fits over the middle elastic stays using two strong tight elastic loops that catch the end. I am betting those will hold lots of music as well. I added lettering on the outside of mine. I was worried that the gold lettering on the front would easily rub off over time as it bounced around in my music bag with my water bottle etc... Nope, the letters are actually embossed into the leather like material, like stamped into it or indented. Extremely professional look and user friendly folder. It has all a performer needs. Very pleased with purchase, thank you. I will recommend your company to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T20:08:38.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The representative I had the pleasure of working with Kristen Cinque was second to none. In the beginning stages it will be challenging because the only way they can help you is for you to send the information that they request of you. Everything is time sensitive therefore if you don't take it seriously don't bother wasting your time.\nFolks this works. I actually saved over $170,000 dollars in reference to my Offer n Compromise. All the request and constant deadlines that I responded on time and took very serious paid off in the end.\nToday I have a fresh start and I owe it all first and foremost to a spiritual aspect an second to Omni Financial and my Rep. Kristen Cinque. She no doubt is the best in the business.\nLast I just want to say its never too late to get a handle on your tax mess. The longer you procrastinate the worst it will become. It doesn't go away it gets worst.\nPickup the phone right now and call Omni Financial and ask for Kristen Cinque or her assistant they are the best. It feels good to have a fresh start with the Internal Revenue Service.\nRespectfully yours,\nR Neal", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T18:40:19.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

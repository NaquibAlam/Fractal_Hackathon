As they were floor tickets at Festival Hall we could choose where we wanted to stand and move if someone tall was in front of us. We were not far from the stage in the centre so we had a great view of the show. We would do it again in an instant. Thanks so much for managing the resale of tickets through your official site. Otherwise we wouldn't have been able to go at such a late stage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:33:32.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

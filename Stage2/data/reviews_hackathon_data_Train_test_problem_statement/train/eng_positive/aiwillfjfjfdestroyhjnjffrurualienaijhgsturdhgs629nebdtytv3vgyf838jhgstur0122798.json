Very knowledgeable with the furniture. We were able to take our time to look over various types of styles without being pressured by staff. Once we found the one my wife and I liked we decided to take 24 hours to think about it before we made the purchase so we told our sales lady what we decided to do. She understood our situation and proceeded to tell us that what she does herself before making a big purchase of any kind. She gave us her business card and told us whenever you decide to buy the dinning room set to give her a call and told us her work schedule the next couple of days. So the next day we decided to make the purchase. I stopped by after work and she was there and it didn't take long to order the furniture & sign the papers. With in 20 minutes I was out the door. Next day shipping with the times I wanted. Great overall experience. We will be back again for other furniture needs that's for sure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:56:27.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

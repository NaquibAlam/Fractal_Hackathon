It was a great price and hard to refuse. The day after I placed an order I noticed all the bad reviews this company was getting on Facebook . I wanted to cancel my order but it was already shipped. My experience was EXCELLENT. Customer service by email was great, my purchase arrived in 3 days with no hassle. I believe they are authentic and came in mint condition. Not 100% believer if they are authentic , the knock offs keep getting better. Still a happy customer with the quality and cost of the glasses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T04:13:27.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

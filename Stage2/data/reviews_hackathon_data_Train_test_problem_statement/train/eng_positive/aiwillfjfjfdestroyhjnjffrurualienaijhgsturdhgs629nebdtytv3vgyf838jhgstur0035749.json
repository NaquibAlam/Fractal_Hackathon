And that is the first company I look for good deals. Had problems with one airline due to flying with my pet. My advisor was willing to help me and looked through all the options he had to get a better flight that would accommodate my needs for for my pet and I . My Advisor was friendly I it seem that it was his mission to get me the flight I looked for and even called me back to offer me a better flight . I was pleasantly surprised that he gave me a later call and offered me that flight that I have right now . Special thanks to the advisor that helped me through my craziness dealing directly with the Airlines . I would give a 100 for his knowledge and compassion and professionalism in his job . That is what I call perfect customer service and perfect customer care. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:02:04.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

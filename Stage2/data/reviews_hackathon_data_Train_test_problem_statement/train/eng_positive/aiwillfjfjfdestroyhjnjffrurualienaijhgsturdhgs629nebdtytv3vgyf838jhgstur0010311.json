We requested access at Sydney Airport rather than a more remote bussing location, as we had a lot of luggage. The office was busy, but we were not in a hurry. We used the car around Sydney for a week then returned it. We didn't use much fuel and intended to fill it up somewhere near the airport. No petrol stations at the airport (most have a nearby petrol station) or anywhere remotely near the airport meant that we had to pay the high price for the fuel.

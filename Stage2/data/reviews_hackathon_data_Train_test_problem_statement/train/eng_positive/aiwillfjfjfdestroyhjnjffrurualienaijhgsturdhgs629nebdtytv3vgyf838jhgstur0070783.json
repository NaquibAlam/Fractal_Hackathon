Not only did it come super fast but it has been an absolute god send. After 18 years of gymnastics i already suffer with my back but from having 2 major operations this past 18 months its become even worse. I was loosing all hope not only on being able to get through the day without being keeled over in pain but i have been longing for at least 1 decent night sleep since god knows when. Its brilliantly made, very sturdy and does exactly what it is supposed to do and the size fits perfectly with the adjustable straps to suit your needs. I was a bit wary at first thinking it was only for people that lift weights etc but after speaking to my specialist and physio i thought i would give it a go and for the price you cant complain. I don't think i can recommend this product enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T07:29:53.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

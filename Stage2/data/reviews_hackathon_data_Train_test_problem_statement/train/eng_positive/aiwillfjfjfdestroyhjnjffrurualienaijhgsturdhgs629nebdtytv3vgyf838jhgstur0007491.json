Yes it's a Bootcamp for fitness and nutrition but also it gave me so much more. Mentally I feel so much stronger than I have in a very long time. I booked a week in Portugal but decided to stay longer and finish two weeks with Staff R and Staff W (also Staff F for week 1). The commitment they all show in helping us all get the results we so craved is commendable. They have so much passion which comes from years of experience and the ability to listen to feedback over the years has made them in my opinion the best in the business. I would never ever consider using another company when it comes to my health and wellbeing. I will be returning and cannot wait. The chef was outstanding and quality of food was excellent. Also, I feel friends for life have been made. That wasn't really an intention but sometimes it can't be helped when for a week or two weeks we all had goals in common and helped each other when the going got tough. I can't thank Prestige enough and they deserve all their accolades and some Simon C.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T15:40:17.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

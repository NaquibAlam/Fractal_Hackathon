Their prices were the best that I could find in Canada, that along with the free delivery made it an easy decision. I placed my order late on Thursday evening. By Monday Fed Ex was calling me to say the hitch was in Winnipeg and wanting to arrange for delivery on Tues. Was delivered to my home by 9:30...can't ask for any better. The only thing I did not receive, was the email from Fed Ex along with a tracking number that Hitchweb said would come. Not too big of a deal given that Fed Ex called by monday to arrange delivery.\nHitch arrived in great condition, well packed, with excellent instructions and went together very easily...anxious to tow with it.\nExcellent experience with Hitchweb and would not hesitate to use them again and to recommend to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:17:03.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

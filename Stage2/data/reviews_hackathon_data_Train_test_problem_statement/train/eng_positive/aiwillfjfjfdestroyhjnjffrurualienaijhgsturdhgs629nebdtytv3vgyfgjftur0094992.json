They were lovely artic white wooden and lasted up until now, no problems whatsoever! I moved out & left them at the house. I completely forgot about Blinds2go when I moved into my new property and had Quote: s from other companies in the £100's for 2 windows. Luckily for me I recommend Blinds2go go to family and friends and my best friend reminded me where she got her blind \"Remember Blinds2go you recommend me\" . I have done my 3 bed house including kitchen and two bathrooms again with Blinds2go. I'm going to estimate I paid around £400 in total. The quality is....**speechless. I will forever use Blinds2go and please if you're reading this and looking for made to measure curtains/blinds 100% you wont regret it! I would like to say so much...but I'm pretty rubbish with reviews.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:52:31.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

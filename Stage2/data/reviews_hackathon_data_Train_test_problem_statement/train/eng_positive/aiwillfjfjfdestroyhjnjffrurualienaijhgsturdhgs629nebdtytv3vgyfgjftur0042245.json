They really do work hard to help ensure that the customers are satasified with there services, product, and purchase! They are very friendly and on top of that their glasses are super stylish, affordable, and just excellent quality! I would honestly recommend to everyone and buy more myself, its so good to have different choices of glasses wear and not being stuck with one frame that is expensive.

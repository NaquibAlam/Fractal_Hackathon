But on top of their attractive prices, I trust B&H and their website entirely. The buying experience is seamless, and in the one case that a parcel got lost by the post office and later turned up after B&H had sent a replacement for free, I was offered to keep both items with no extra charge. The only thing that prevents me from buying more is that I would have to pay import charges, which would make my purchases less attractive. But this of course has nothing to do with the store itself, which I recommend without reservation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T12:34:55.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

You guys always have what I need, with a great selection of OEM parts at a price that's hard to beat. Shipping is always fast and out of all the times I've ordered parts online I have only had to call customer service two or three times, with that said though the issues were always minor and resolved within one phone call! The customer service representatives are always friendly and very helpful to talk to.\nAll in all my favorite website to shop at, and I recommend the site to everyone for all their European car needs!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T14:05:11.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

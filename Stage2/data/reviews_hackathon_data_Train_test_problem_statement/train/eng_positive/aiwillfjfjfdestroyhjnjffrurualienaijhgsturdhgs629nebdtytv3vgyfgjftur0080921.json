Waterfalls, zip Lining, white water rafting and so on.\nI didn't expect to fit it all into my week. But when I got the first proposal I was amazed, we switched some dates for the tours around. We added some tours, it turned out to be a wonderful vacation and experience. Dyionne did an outstanding job, checked always for the availabilities of the tours and made things happen. I probably will book with Namu again. Everything was perfect, the Hotel, the tours and how it was planned.

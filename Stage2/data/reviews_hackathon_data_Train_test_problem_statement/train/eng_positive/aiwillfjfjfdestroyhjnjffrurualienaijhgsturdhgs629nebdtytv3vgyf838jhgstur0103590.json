So we had been talking about investing in a high dollar mattress to help with her pain. We needed something much more better than what we had so she started researching about the many different styles and brands. She narrowed it down to three brands and styles. We headed to the Gardner White at Hall Rd and Hayes but it was closed do to high winds knocking electrical lines down. So we called the 14 and Ryan store and they were open. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by this guy named Mike. I was thinking here we go this guy is gonna take us for a ride and tell us what we wanted to here but this guy was really here to help us with her back pain. Mark Gattinger wasn't that guy just to make a sale he was really knowledgeable in what we were looking for. He told us he's had training and even went to the factory to see how they were made. Im so glad that the store wasn't open at Hall and Hayes or we wouldn't of never met Mark. Thank you for helping my love with her pain.\nJoe Goclowski", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:12:50.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After sharing with them our ideas of what we would like to see, they created a plan to see everything we could in the 10 days we had available for our family trip. Their experience in the region of Patagonia was so helpful and they arranged fantastic hotels and tours for us. Every guide and driver was so informative and helpful. We will definitely book our next trip with Jacada Travel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:05:31.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

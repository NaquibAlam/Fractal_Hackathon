I purchased a Medium-sized shirt, as I normally do, and found it to be a bit smaller than most Medium-sized items. This, of course, does not reflect on SSENSE, but on Vetements, as each brand's classification for sizing can vary.\nWhat some webisites do is provide a brief description of the fit of the shirt, and some will even provide suggestions such as \"buy one size up from your normal size\". I think this would be a valuable addition to SSENSE and would enhance what is an already successful platform for shopping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:50:50.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I bought one each - crew neck and V-neck, both in Tall Slim. I'm 6' 3\", 180 lbs I was on the bubble of regular Tall and Tall Slim. Since my main issue with standard T-shirts is length I decided to order the Tall shirts. These underehirts are plenty long, and As such I really don't need the extra length of Tall. I found the V-necks to have a bit too deep of a V for my preference. Many shirts - especially white allow the V to show through, and it's quite a bit lower than the last button I close.\nI just placed an order for more crew necks in size Large which I think will be perfect. If the V-necks were offered in standard depth V or a deep V, I would order the standard V.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T16:25:03.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

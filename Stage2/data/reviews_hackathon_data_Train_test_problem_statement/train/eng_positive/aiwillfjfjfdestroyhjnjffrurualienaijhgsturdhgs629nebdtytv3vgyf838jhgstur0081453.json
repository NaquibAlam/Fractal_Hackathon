I paid through paypal and was amazed at how quick I received the item. After getting a letter to say I had to pay import tax and paying for it on line, it was with me two days later. All in all took around 10 days but I had no problems what so ever. Absolutely fantastic customer service and would definitely tell anyone else to order from them. Thank you once again for saving me quite a bit of money", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T20:21:23.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

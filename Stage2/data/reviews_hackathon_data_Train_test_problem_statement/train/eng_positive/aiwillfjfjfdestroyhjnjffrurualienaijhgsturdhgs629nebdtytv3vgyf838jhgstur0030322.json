I was offered a fair price for a mixed selection of old books. Yes, I MAY have been able to get a little more for them via online auction, but it would have taken a LOT more effort, with no guarantee of success anyway (anyone who has tried selling non-collectible books online will know how hit and miss that is).\nHaving agreed the price, I packed the books, took the parcel to a local shop/pickup point, got a receipt - and that was it. Several days later I had an acknowledgement from Ziffit, and, after checking the books, confirmation that payment was going to be made. A day or so later the payment was in my Paypal account.\nCouldn't have been simpler, and I shall certainly use it again.\nDave Dale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:44:34.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

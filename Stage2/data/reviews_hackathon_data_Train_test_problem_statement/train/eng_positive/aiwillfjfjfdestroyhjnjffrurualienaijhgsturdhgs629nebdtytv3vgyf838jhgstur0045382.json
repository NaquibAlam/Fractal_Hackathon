Congo through Orange. I always wondered why but there is not an amount like 2, 5 or 10$ appearing. It starts at around 9.75$. I would have been even happier if there were more choices to choose from.\nOther that as stated earlier, this is a great app to use. I encourage you to go ahead, put some voice credits and break any bridges distance may have built between you and your loved ones!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T08:00:45.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We found Display It by web search and began the process of creating an order. We found the web site to be very clear and instructive. Once we created on order we quickly were contacted by Display It and we received a proof of our artwork to review/approve. We made some minor tweaks and within a few hours we approved an updated artwork. Our booth arrived a few days later- well packaged and and perfect.\nThanks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T22:18:17.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

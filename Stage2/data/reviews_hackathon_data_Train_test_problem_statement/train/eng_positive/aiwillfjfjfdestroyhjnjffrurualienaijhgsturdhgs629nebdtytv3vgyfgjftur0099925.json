I admit I was initially a little apprehensive about handing over my house and the care of my cats to someone I did not know for a couple of weeks. However, any fears were soon allayed when I met my sitter. She has just finished sitting for me for a couple of weeks and she has been brilliant, sending me regular photos and updates on my cats. The site works really well and is a great solution for anyone who worries about leaving their pets and burdening neighbours with feeding favours!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:41:47.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

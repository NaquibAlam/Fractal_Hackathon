Alot of other companies want thousands of pounds which people cant afford but e-careers is affordable which is great because it doesnt put you off doing what you want to do. The customers service is outstanding, I contacted them about a question in my test and they sorted it straight away professionally and sincerely. You can trust e-careers in helping you find the right course for your career path. I love it! Everything is there for you. I finally accomplished something and stuck to and im so glad I completed it, there's no pressure or deadline which is exactly what I was looking for. Thankyou e-careers! Thank you so much!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:53:46.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

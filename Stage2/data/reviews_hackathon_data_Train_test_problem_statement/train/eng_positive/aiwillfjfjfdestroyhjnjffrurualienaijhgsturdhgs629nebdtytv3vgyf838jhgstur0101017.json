Justin Elliott was my Specialist and he knocked it out of the park! My items in question were not only removed from my credit report in under a month, but my credit score increased 100 points!!! I was shocked when I looked at my reports this morning, expecting to see maybe a 20-30 point increase, and saw a 100 point increase and my score in the 800's!! If you are looking to repair your credit in order to purchase a home, car, etc., invest in WJ&A and ask for Justin Elliott.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:55:06.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

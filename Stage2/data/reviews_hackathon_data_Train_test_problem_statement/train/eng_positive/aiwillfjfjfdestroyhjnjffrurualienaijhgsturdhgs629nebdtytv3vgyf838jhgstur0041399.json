Thats important when you're on holiday, you don't want to spend your time worrying. We kept in touch which was lovely, photos of the dogs, and just to give us peace of mind which was very thoughtful of them.\nI think it speaks volumes about Phil and Nic when we said we would look them up in Australia when we visit. They were interesting, chilled and funny, and I would genuinely love to see them again.\nI think Trusted Housesitters its a great platform to find a match for your animal and house needs, and if used correctly can work time and time again.I certainly hope it does for us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T12:54:53.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

She doesn't cook, ever, and this got her in the kitchen and enjoying it.\nI love that it gives my husband and I a variety of meals. We have a habit of getting into a recipe rut and eating the same dozen foods over and over. With Hello Fresh, there's always different recipes to try.\nThe food is fast. With opposing schedules, we don't always get a lot of time to spend together, but we both really enjoy the half hour we spend making dinner together on Hello Fresh nights.\nThe food tastes good. Out of all three of the boxes so far, I haven't had a single meal that was bad, and only one that I wasn't crazy about. That's pretty good odds for me.\nThe meals are balanced. We're always saying we're going to add more vegetables to our diet, but it never really happens. The meals from Hello Fresh have a good balance of protein, starch, and veggies, including some veggies we'd never tried before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:34:10.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

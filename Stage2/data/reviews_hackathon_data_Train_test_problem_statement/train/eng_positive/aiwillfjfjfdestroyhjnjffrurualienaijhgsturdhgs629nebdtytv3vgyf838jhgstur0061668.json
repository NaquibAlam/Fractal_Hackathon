There are always plenty of opportunities to get a good sale on clothing and shoes and there are plenty of cute things if you look long enough. Granted some things are a bit too revealing for me, but there's tons of adorable pieces in there. I've bought quite a few of the 'dresses' and wear them as shirts, and have gotten tons of compliments. Buying on here is cheaper than in most stores around me anymore. I just wish there was an option to use more than one coupon code at once.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T21:34:08.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I was really afraid to do so since I like silhouette frames which are pretty expensive and didn't know if lens would be correct. I couldn't be more pleased. Prescription is correct. I haven't had the frames adjusted yet but will eventually since I had to pay my local optician $30.00 to measure my P D for me, but he will do any adjusting that needs to be done for life of glasses (these don't wear out). I'm so pleased that I intend to call and make arrangements to send my rimless silhouette frames to them to put new lens in them to have a second pair as a backup. Also, and very importantly, the customer service people that I emailed and talked on phone with were very knowledgeable and helpful---highest rating for quality of work and customer service people. Thank you. You saved me about half of what I would have paid in local optical shop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:55:15.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

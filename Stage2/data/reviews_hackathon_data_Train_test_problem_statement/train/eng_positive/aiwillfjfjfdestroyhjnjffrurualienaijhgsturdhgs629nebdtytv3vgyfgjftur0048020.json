I had two $200 gift cards to Tiffany. I was a little hesitant about sending them both at the same time in case it didn't work out but ended up sending them both in the same envelope with two different order numbers. The first gift card was processed quickly. The gift cards arrived at their P.O. Box Friday and they processed it Monday. I was a little concerned since the second one didn't process at the same time despite them being in the same envelope and being the exact same gift card. I emailed them that evening and they replied that same evening and said they aren't always processed at the same time but they did have the other gift card. I waited a few days and it still wasn't processed. I emailed them again and a couple hours later the gift card was processed. Overall it was a really good experience and a fair price was given for two unwanted gift cards. Would definitely use them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:13:27.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

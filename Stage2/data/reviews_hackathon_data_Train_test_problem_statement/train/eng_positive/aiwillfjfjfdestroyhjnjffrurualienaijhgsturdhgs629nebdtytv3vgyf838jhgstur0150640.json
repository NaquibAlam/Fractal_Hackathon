In total we have placed around 50 different name tag orders, along with name plaques. we order frequently, and usually order more than one tag at a time. They are Great with timely service and the only complaint that I have is that we ordered a name plate, and unfortunately my fast fingers got the best of me, and i misspelled a name. I called to see if we were able to get a replacement sent ot us for free, since this particular name tag we had ordered before. They were only able to give us 20% off, and while I don't think we are their top client our business should still be valued at more than 20%. We will still continue to use their products because other than that issue they have been great.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:04:53.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We were new to our area and in need of a nice kennel for our dogs to stay at while we traveled. One of our dogs does not do well in a kennel environment due to separation anxiety. Rover was our answer. Our dogs had someone with them continuously and they were well cared for. We had no worries whatsoever while we were gone. Pictures were sent to us regularly showing our dogs having the time of their lives. Prices were in line or slightly cheaper than most commercial dog kennels. But like the title of my review says, you can't put a price on peace of mind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T14:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:05:36.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

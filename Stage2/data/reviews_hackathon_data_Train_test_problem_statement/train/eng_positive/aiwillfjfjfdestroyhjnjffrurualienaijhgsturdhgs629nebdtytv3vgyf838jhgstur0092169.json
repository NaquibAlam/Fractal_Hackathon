This company is the ONLY company I will recommend for anyone moving locally or relocating.\nThey arrived on time, took great care with my things. Got everything packed up with precision.\nMoving is stressful, even in the midst of joy but the team did a great job!\nThe team went above and beyond just wrapping and packing my furniture and their team in India also helped me to set it all up at the new house and recommending where things such as my bed should go in the room so that all the furniture would fit.\nFast, careful, and gentle with breakable items. Definitely a 5-star recommendation.\nThank you for making that leg of my move smoothie and hassle free.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T10:33:12.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

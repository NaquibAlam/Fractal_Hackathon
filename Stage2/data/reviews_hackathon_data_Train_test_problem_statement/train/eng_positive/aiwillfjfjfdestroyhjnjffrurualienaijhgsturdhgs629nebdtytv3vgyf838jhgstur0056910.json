We signed up as sitters in Australia last year,have completed sits in Aus, UK and now in Canada.\nThe membership payment is very reasonable for the access you get to host profiles, we could easily fill up the next year with sits. Because of the verification and reviews i xam be confident the host is genuine.\nThe website is easy to use and always improving, i love the new welcome pack option.\nI had a question when fisrt setting up my profile so just popped onto live chat and the agent had everything answered in minutes. Would recommend any animal loving travellers use this site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:53:22.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

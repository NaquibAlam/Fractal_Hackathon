I do a lot of my shopping online, especially for my kids school clothes as well as their Christmas and Birthday toys/games. A couple of my favorite sites to use through TCB are Amazon.com and JCPenney. I spend a lot of money at these two stores in particular and it is nice to know that I will see a return on some of that. I typically cash it in for more Amazon codes and I have Amazon Prime but if I'm strapped on cash or planning a roadtrip, Paypal it is.\nSuch a wonderful thing to be able to use and not a pain like Ebates (that site is so hit and miss).\nI really enjoy the different activities and deals they have as well. I had purchased Easter baskets last year through Kmart and saw quite a return on that one. They also did a little scavenger hunt as well with perks depending on how many \"hummingbirds/eggs\" that you found. Overall, super impressed with TopCashBack as a site and I will absolutely continue to use them in the future and recommend them to everyone I know!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:19:02.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

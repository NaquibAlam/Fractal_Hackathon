I knew I wouldn't find any of the books new, so I decided to give them a try. I signed up and received an instant coupon. They have a wish list where I can save any books I am interested in. If an item is not in stock, they will send you an email when they receive it. Their prices and sales are great, and free shipping on orders over $10! Each book is rated as \"new, like new, acceptable\" etc. I have purchased quite a few \"acceptable\" book copies and when I received them, they were almost brand new! I will definitely be buying from them in the future and I would recommend them to anyone!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:38:02.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

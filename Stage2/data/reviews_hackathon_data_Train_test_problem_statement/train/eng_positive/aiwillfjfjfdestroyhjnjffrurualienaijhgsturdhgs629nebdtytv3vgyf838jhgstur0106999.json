I have never had an issues in the 3 years I have been using it with my rebate crediting. Cash outs are easy and it can be for any amount, even $1, which is awesome, I hate having to have a certain balance before I can get my money out. Paypal pay outs come quickly and you can even get a bonus if you choose gift card cash outs instead.

At least once a year I buy a 2 pound bag of their apricot kernels and dose myself to head off anything that might be attempting to manifest itself in a negative fashion. Apricot Power always answer any questions I have in an expeditious manner and ship whatever product I order very quickly. I would recommend anyone researching natural treatments for cancer or how to boost the immune system just as a precaution utilize these folks as a resource for both knowledge and product. I base this on my own research and of course, Apricot Power does not sell any of their products as something that can cure, treat, prevent, or help any disease, illness, or health condition, and of course, they do not make any claims about any health benefits with their products, my conclusions and choices are based on my own research as to which course of action I take to prevent, treat or cure any condition without having to jump through the pharmaceutical hoop and cause further damage and insult to the body.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T05:16:16.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

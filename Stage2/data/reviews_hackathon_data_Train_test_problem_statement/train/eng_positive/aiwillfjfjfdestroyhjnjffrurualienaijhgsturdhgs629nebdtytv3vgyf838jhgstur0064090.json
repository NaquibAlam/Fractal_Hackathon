The site is easy to use and getting the emails with new sits listed has been fantastic. We also like the fact that we've been able to be 'police checked' via the site. It gives the homeowners that extra needed reassurance that their property will be safely looked after. Also having feedback from previous sits displayed on our profile for potential sits reassures homeowners. Very pleased!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T13:14:50.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The guest bathroom has a 6 ' x 4 ' unframed mirror. I saw Mirror Mate on line and liked what I saw. I ordered the frame and it was delivered I a short period of time.\nThe installation directions are spot on! My son helped me due to the size of the frame. Everything went perfectly and I am VERY HAPPY with the end result. The bathroom looks updated and the frame quality is GREAT. I am going to do my small half bath next! Thanks MirroMate for this impressive product!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:48:38.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

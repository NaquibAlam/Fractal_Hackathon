I constantly buy the less than $5.00 bundles because they are usually well worth the value in both quantity and quality. Not every game is a gem, but they are often games you'd never find otherwise. For the most part, I've never seen a game before finding it on a bundle page, never seen it on steam's front page or any kind of queue. If you pay $1.00 for 29 games it comes out to about 3 cents per game. Even if a game isn't inherently entertaining you can at least find some joy in it, even if it's in how bad the game is. Almost every time you are able to find a gem well worth the dollar and every other game might as well have been free.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:44:39.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

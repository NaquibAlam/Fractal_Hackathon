I was desperately looking for some place I could bring my puppy while I was away for the weekend. Rover exceeded my needs. I highly recommend meet and greets prior to booking. That is what we did with 2 different people and I was then torn on which to choose! I can now leave for a weekend and know that my puppy is at a safe place where she loves to go and I can relax without any concern! No cold, chaotic, inhumane kennel care for this pup. The app was a little bit cumbersome to sign on, navigate and figure out initially; however, it was definitely worth the time and effort as now that I have the hang of it, it is simple enough. As a new customer, who happened to find Rover while searching the internet by accident, my only advise to Rover is to advertise. Many people with pets do not know what Rover is, how it works, or that it even exists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:04:15.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

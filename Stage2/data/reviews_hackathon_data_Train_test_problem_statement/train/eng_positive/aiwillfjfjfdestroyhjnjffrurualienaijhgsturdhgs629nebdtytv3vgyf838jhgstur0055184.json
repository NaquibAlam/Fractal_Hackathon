He confirmed that my refund had been processed. He also assured me that my case would be reviewed and dealt with accordingly and even gave me enough credit on Game Cheap for a free game. While the original experience was... not very pleasant... it is nice to see a company that is willing to right some of their wrongs and personally reach out to their customers who may have had bad experiences. I can't quite justify a 5 star review with all the turbulence up to this point, but my experience has gone from about a 1 star experience to a 4 star one. Thanks Jordan.\nSo I pre-ordered Horizon Zero Dawn from gamecheap in early February. The website states that I would receive the game on release day. However, the day before release, I still had not received a shipping confirmation. I contacted customer service and after telling me it looked like my payment hadn't gone through yet (which my bank statement said otherwise), the representative finally told me the order would be on its way and arrive to me in two days. Which was a day after the release day, but no big deal to me. However it wasnt until two days later that I finally receive a shipment confirmation and it said the package was out for delivery in Austin, Texas (I live in Nevada). So I message them asking for a refund, with no response. I finally receive a package on Saturday and think to myself, \"Whatever, I finally got the game... I'll just keep it and steer clear of this website from now on.\" Only to open the package and find Zelda for Wii U waiting inside. I honestly didn't know whether to be upset or amazed at the magnitude of the tornado that this experience had been. I sent a request for a refund that day, again to no response. I was finally responded to yesterday (3/9) from a representative saying they would be refunding me, which is the only reason this is a two star review rather than one. We shall see how long that takes, however.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T11:23:45.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

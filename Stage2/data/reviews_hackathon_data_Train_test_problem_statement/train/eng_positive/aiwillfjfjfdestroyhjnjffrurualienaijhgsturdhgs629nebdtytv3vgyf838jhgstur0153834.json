The arrangements were easy and well done. We tweaked the itinerary during the trip, at the suggestion of our driver. The one we had was too packed, it was a great suggestion. Our driver was very good and patient as we had my 84 year old father with us. He was great with him, and even went above and beyond helping us find our family roots. We stayed at very nice modern hotels, that made traveling with a senior easy and comfortable. The falconry at the Castle in Cong was an unexpected treat, just a great way to spend the afternoon, this was also at the suggestion of our driver.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:49:20.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

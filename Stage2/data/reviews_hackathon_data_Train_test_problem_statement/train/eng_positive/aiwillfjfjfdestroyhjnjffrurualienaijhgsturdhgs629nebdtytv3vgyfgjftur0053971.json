One problem we've had is that the code behind the scenes sometimes does quirky things. I'm a website designer, so I understand most of what is going on with the code, and can usually fix it. But doing copy and paste even within an email is difficult - it loses the formatting that I want and has to be done over. Customer service is always knowledgeable and helpful. The Chat feature is a great time saver. So if that problem with copy and paste can be corrected, I'd be very happy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T17:25:31.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

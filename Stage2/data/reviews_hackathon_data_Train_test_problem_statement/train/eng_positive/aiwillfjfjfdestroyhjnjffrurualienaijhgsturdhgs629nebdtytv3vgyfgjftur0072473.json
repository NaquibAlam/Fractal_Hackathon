Our regular dog sitter ended up in the hospital the night before we were scheduled to fly out of town at 8am the next morning! Boy were we in a panic! We'd never had to use a back up before so we didn't have one. I went online trying to locate a place to board our baby, but nothing stood out especially last minute. Then up popped Rover and a competitor. I was shocked that such a service existed! I read through the providers and found one that was familiar with our breed (American Bulldog), her diet (Raw) and she had hundreds of excellent reviews. Now if she would be willing to take our Snowy in for EIGHT DAYS without a meet and greet. I signed up, emailed her and minutes later she responded with a yes! I could have cried. One of us was going to have to stay back with Snowy if we couldn't find a sitter. We loaded her up and went to Tia's. Tia and her American Bulldog met us at the door and everyone was introduced. It was a bit scary just leaving her without her understanding what was going on, but we were also glad to be able to leave her in a home where she was actually being cared for and not just in doggie jail. Tia sent pics every day. Snowy was doing fine. It was a loong stay, but we felt good knowing she was being cared for. We picked her up without any issues. It was well worth the money and the peace of mind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:02:09.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

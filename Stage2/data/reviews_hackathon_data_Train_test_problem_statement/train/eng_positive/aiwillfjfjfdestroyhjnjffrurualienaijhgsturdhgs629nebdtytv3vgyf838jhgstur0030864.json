I read online reviews that were all disappointing. My sister in law just had a baby a year ago. She hasnt been able to get the weight off of her she works as a new private practice Veterinarian so she has more time to complain than workout. I have always been a big runner. I was diagnosed with MS this past few years. I became a Personal Trainer and Dietician for my own health. Around the holidays we were together this past year, she had on a pair of Fabletics leggings and I had on an almost exact pattern in a crop on (not Fabletics). I couldn't believe the quality! Or the difference! It was like night and day. I just made my second purchase in 2weeks. I am hooked! Getting out to run today in my new Salar crops hope they make my run as comfortable as they feel. Thank you for bringing something to the table of good quality, the option to skip, or purchase more. I think that I am going to enjoy being fab with Fabletics! (Nerdy I know!)\nV/R\nJessica R.

Below are the positive and negatives:\nPositives:\n- Skipper was flexible, had a lot of knowledge of the area and accommodating for all passengers.\n- Locations / islands are amazing and the best way to see them all is via sailing.\n- Boat was large enough to avoid feeling cramped and each cabin had it's own toilet and shower.\nNegatives\n- The Trip Notes Intrepid provided were in accurate. For example - the details on where to meet on the first day were incorrect. The notes also mentioned that some meals were included however this was not the case.\n- The first day was disappointing due to lack of organisation for purchasing of food and location of the first night wasn't anything great.\n- Although the vessel was large enough, it was a bit dated and comfort of the bedding could be improved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:44:14.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

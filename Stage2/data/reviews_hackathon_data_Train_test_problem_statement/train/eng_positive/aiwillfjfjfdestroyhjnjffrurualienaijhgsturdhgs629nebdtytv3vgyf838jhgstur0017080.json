My first order was an outfit put together by the site. The first order consisted of: Shape\nBronte Millie L/S Tee, Petal Capri, Dash Seamless Bra II. I love every piece that came! They were all very, very cute, and extremely comfy. My second order should arrive in a week and I will be reviewing: Femina Tank & Brogan Mesh Legging. I'm very excited for these items. All in all, I love cute workout clothes which this site offers. I think the prices are too high at times, so I tend to pick items based off what I would normally spend. I skip a lot of months, and purchase a new outfit maybe every 3-4 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T11:20:42.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

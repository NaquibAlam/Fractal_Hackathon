I am a bible student going to a 3 year program. Sometimes finding some books can be difficult or just expensive. When I found you on google, I could not believe what my eyes were seeing. You guys are a hidden jewel! And I say \"hidden\" because a lot of people don't know about you.\nI got 4 AMAZING books in GREAT condition for only $15 bucks. I was expecting to get something with low quality but to my surprise, the books look great. I will definitely continue to order from you in the future. As a matter of fact, my classmates will do too. I just gotta give them my code. If there's anything I could do as a customer to help you become more popular, I'd be glad to do it.\nGod bless the work of your hands and may your business grow and be very prosperous.\nXoxo from PA,\nMJ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:46:30.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

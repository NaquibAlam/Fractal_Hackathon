Originally, I was skeptical about ordering from SmartBuyGlasses due to some negative reviews recently posted regarding the length of time in receiving orders. After contacting Customer Service, they explained to me that certain frames might be out of stock which may delay an order. (If it doesn't say \"Ships: FREE Same day Dispatch\" under the frames you are viewing, they are NOT in stock and your order will take longer.) The frames I ordered were in stock and it took only 8 days to receive my prescription glasses. That's faster than my local Sears or Stanton Optical! Frames and prescription lenses were exactly what I ordered.

The order & shipping was carried out without a problem. Notification on delivery status is on a professional level.\nThe phone had the unlocked bootloader and the correct twrp recovery was already flashed, which made the whole process of installing Combo Rom quite easy. Grossoshop rom was not bad, but i like to experiment.\nNever tried 2-year warranty and hopefully i won't have to:) but from what i heard, this is much better handled than by other sellers, who sell chinese phones. So far it's been a great experience with grossoshop. Prices are a bit higher then the competition, but makes sense with this kind od great communication and a 2-year warranty. Can only recommend grossoshop.\n5 Stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T21:21:54.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

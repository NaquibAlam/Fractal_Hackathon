Part of my order was out of stock but Mikey from customer services politely emailed me to say my purchase may be a day or two late. Even offering an instant refund if I wasn't happy to wait. To my surprise the pads I'd ordered Sunday did in fact still arrive by Thursday. Most companies wont take the time to personally email customers let alone ones with such small orders so Micks Garage has been more than impressive. Won't hesitate to use them again come MOT time.

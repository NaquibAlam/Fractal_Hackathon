I had questions about how to order my prescription goggles. I called up and a live person answered the phone and resolved every question. I also needed them on a rush basis for an upcoming trip. When I placed the order I was given a discount I didn't know my product qualified for. The goggles got to me in time--no problem! I got friendly service. The site is easy to use and if you have further questions, there is a friendly, knowledgable person at the other end of the telephone line. I will not hesitate to order from them again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T23:31:14.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

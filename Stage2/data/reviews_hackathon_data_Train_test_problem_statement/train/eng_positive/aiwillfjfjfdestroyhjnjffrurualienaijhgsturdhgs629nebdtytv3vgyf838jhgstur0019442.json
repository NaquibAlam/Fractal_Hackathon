I got it because I love the watercolour design, but I didn't expect the quality is so good as well. I am the type of person who always drop my phone but Casetify's case is so sturdy that I don't have to worry about breaking my screen anymore. Even the packaging itself is very nice. I really recommend Casetify for anyone who is looking for phone case that got both design and protection, and their phone case is a really good idea for gift too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:26:38.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

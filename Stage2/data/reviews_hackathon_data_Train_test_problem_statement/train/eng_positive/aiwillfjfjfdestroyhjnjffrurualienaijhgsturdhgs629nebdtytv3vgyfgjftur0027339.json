I thankfully had Gap insurance so everything was covered. I expected it to take about a month for everything to go through but two weeks after the accident I got a call from Darren who said everything was complete and I could come down and pick out a car with ZERO down!! I originally had to put $1000 down on my last car so I was so relieved when he said ZERO down. When I got to Drivetime Darren was so awesome. He was caring and understanding about the situation and really listened to what I wanted and didn't try to push other vehicles I didn't want on me. All of the sale people who helped were so great and I left in a new car with ZERO down and lower payments then before. I will always recommend Drivetime and after how great they were yesterday I will even more!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:50:26.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I literally went from over a hundred emails daily to only have to look at a dozen or so. They're all there, tucked away in other folders, but the important ones are all left in the Inbox where you want them.Training the service is as easy as can be, and you can customize quite a bit about how SaneBox sorts your incoming mail.\nTo me, what's even more important is how great the SaneBox team is. When I lost my job and couldn't afford to renew my service, SaneBox gave me seven months of free service so I could have time to get back on my feet! After I explained my circumstances to them, they even sent back an email with well wishes on my job search. At every step I felt treating like an actual person, not just some hypothetical customer.\nI couldn't recommend SaneBox more highly. Honestly, I am an IT professional and it ranks among the top two or three positive technology experiences of a two-decade career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:08:34.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

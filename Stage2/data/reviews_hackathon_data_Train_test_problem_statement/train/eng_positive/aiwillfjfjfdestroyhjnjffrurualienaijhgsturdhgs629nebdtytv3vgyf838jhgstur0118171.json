My husband and granddaughter have reservations about going on a cruise as they both get seasick in normal boats and ferries.

Being first time cruisers, he told me what to expect and gave me lots of tips on what to take etc. My husband is a lot more settled and is happy to embark on our first ever cruise in a few weeks time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T11:39:20.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Upon meeting David, we instantly liked him; he presented professionally and was extremely knowledgeable and clearly experienced in the real estate of the area. We knew that we had found the right person to sell our father's home. David communicated with us constantly from before our property went on the market to finally sticking the sold sticker on the advertising board. David's good work involved wasting no time with photography and advertising and it wasn't long before he had prospective buyers attending the inspections. David, with Richard Lowe and the Nelson Alexander team of Essendon sold our father's home in five weeks for a price we only dreamt about. We couldn't speak more highly of David and the amazing service he provided to us, and we have no hesitations in recommending Nelson Alexander to anyone looking to sell their home.\nThank you for all your assistance!\nMarilyn Cocciardi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T05:22:23.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

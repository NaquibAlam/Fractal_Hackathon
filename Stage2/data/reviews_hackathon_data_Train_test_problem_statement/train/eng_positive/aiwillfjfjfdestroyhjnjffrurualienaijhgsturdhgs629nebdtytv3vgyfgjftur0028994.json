Once in the last year I switched one of the email sources to a new email client and the transition was seamless.\nI feel I'm just scratching the surface on how I can use this application to help me. Yesterday I dialed in to a webinar between SaneBox and TextExpander. I have also used TextExpander for a number of years and I was blown away by how these two applications can work together with email to save me time.\nI was introduced to SaneBox through a couple respected podcasts and I'm very happy I first tried it out and then became a subscriber. I recommend anyone who wants to control their life and productivity and not let the constant stream of email take control, try out SaneBox.\nThanks,\nBob W.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:08:16.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

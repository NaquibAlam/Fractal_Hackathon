Upon Rechecking the Cartridge, I noticed that the Black ink was leaking. I took it out, and put back a Brothers Cartridge. Printer just got worst. I noticed that their was ink all over the place, so I put it on Manuel Cleaning, and then put in a NEW Bk Cartridge that was sent to me as a replacement, and EVERYTHING NOW seems to be working just fine. What started out bad, ENDED UP WELL!

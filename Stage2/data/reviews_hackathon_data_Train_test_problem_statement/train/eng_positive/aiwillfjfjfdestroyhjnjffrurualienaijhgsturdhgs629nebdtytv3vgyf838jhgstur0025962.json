Dad is 97 and Mom, 90. They continue to live on the Monterey Peninsula in our family home of over 100 years old. A very loving, rich, colorful, spiritual life is what they have lived. Even with 21 immediate family members, we couldn't come up with an idea for a \"gift.\" After all these years their greatest joy is our family. Needless to say they are very non-material people. I remembered someone who visited my office shared a beautiful idea he had...so at that time I said, well if you ever actual DO IT... my parents are having an Anniversary in the coming years. It never occurred to me that this person would remember our conversation. He changed businesses...went on his way...we kept in touch. One day I received an email from him and he asked me about my Parents Anniversary. He asked me if I'd like Songfinch to write for them. And so it happened. It was emotional for our Parents, the Family, the Few Guests. There wasn't a dry eye in the place. To MISQuote: THE ORACLE OF DELPHI -- The greatest blessings come by way of MUSIC, indeed of MUSIC that is heaven sent. THAT IS SONGFINCH. THAT IS THE HEART OF THE PERSON WHO IS AT THE CENTER OF SONGFINCH. THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT SUCCEED. I THANK THEM.

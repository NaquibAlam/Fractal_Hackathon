Delivery was so quick. Paid for tracking checked after receiving a shipped email said still in Ireland 15 mins later the knocked mr postman with the pushchair. It's solid but light to carry. Easy to set up. We got the rainbow dots and it's stunning. Love how the actual pushchair lies back straight ideal for sleeping toddler. The design of the chair is great the foot is made out of what i can only describe as car mat rubber. No more muddy shoe prints. The only drawback is the changing bag. Although matching it looks cheap and tacky. Yes it's the same as the rest of the pram/car seat etc which again I will state is stunning somehow it doesn't gel right me and my daughter jut looked at each and said no not using this. So yes overall very satisfied in fact I'm about to order another as I'm so lucky to be blessed with 2 more grandchildren taking the total to 6. And uberchild has to be the best travel system we have had so far", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:24:05.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The app is very good to use and as someone with no knowledge of the language, I'm learning a lot in a very short time. The app is well structured but could use some efficiency updates as sometimes it's slightly slow on the response to my answers etc. I'm looking forward to continuously using this app and I would recommend it for most people interested in another language. Very priceworthy and easy to use. I review my lessons on my way to work and practise new lessons when I come home in the arvo.\nGreat product!

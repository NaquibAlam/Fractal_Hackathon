I had a couple of run in with the guys at Melbourne airport, they have some weird rules. For instance if you're from the same state that your renting the car from you have to pay a $1000 dollar security deposit. But apparently this is due to past issues with people giving fake licenses and stealing the car. Also they want proof of address other than drivers licence. Which is weird, but again with the stealing of cars thing.\nThe guys at Sydney airport were better organized and generally friendlier.\nThe other thing is that you pretty much need to get insurance. Any little scratch, no matter who is at fault, is gonna cost you $4,000. Unless you get their $35 a day insurance, or otherwise have it covered. Having insurance isn't such a bad thing, but be sure to factor it in when you're seeing the cost of the car.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:49:28.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

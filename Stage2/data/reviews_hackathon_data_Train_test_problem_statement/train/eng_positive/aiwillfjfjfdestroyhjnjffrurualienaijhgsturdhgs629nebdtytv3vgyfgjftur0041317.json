We had a few months before we had to go, but the dates were not flexible as it was for a wedding, and the times were very specific because of the van that was picking up all the guests on arrival. Over several weeks I received notices, from FlightHub and other operators. FlightHub consistently had lower prices. Then an incredible $200 drop in price per ticket arrived in my Inbox. I jumped on it and booked our flight (for all four of us). Easy and straightforward and immediate. Only one suggestion I would make is to have the last screen before booking a little less cluttered with information, showing only what you are committing to. Not really a big problem since the end result was so good. My tickets and itinerary arrived via email a minute later. Really pleased with the service!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T23:21:41.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

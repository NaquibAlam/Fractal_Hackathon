I ordered a Patagonia Retool pullover in the beginning of February. I got $10 off my first order and had free shipping so it brought the total down the one of the cheapest prices on this jacket I wanted. With the free shipping it was 5-7 business days, and I am in California so I expected the longer shipping. To my surprise, they shipped it that day and I got it 3 days later! So easy, super fast, and I will definitely order through Uncle Dan's again, even despite the longer distance I am from them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T14:57:53.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

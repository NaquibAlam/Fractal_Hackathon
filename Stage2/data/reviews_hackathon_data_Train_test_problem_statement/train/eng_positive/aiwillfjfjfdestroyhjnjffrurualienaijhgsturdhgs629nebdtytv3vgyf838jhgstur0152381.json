The tour guides, the experiences, the people we've met, as well as those who were accompanying us on tour, all contributed to wonderful holiday memories. We have appreciated being able to see how the locals live in an authentic, safe and respectful way. We've learnt that keeping an open mind to new experiences and being flexible are key ingredients to getting the most out of our holidays. We look forward to more Intrepid adventures in the not too distant future!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:45:42.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

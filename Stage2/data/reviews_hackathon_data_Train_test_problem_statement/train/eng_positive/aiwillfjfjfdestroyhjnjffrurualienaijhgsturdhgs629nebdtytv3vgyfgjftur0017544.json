On arrival to each destination we were greeted and cared for . Glen proposed hotel Le Bua in Bangkok where we stayed 2 nights, it was a great hotel and the sky Bar was out of this world , a must to see !! The staff were great and the break-fast was very nice. Also the staff from Destination Asia who collected us from the Airports and got us to our hotels were polite , and very help-full. From Bangkok we flew to Koh Samui and stayed at the Peace Resort, the accommodation was a deluxe room and was truly wonderfull , couldn't have wished for anything more! Perfect ! the hotel bar/ restaurant was however a bit disappointing , it really needs up dating ! Food was average ! and also sunbeds could be up graded ! There are many good restaurants in Koh Samui, we tried lots would recommend Poppies , very nice Thai food , a must ! Eat at Fishermans village , great variety of restaurants ! We also went to Dining on the Rocks , this is a special treat as is expensive but truly worth it if you love fine dining and a great location !\nWould recommend Dial a flight !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T17:41:22.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

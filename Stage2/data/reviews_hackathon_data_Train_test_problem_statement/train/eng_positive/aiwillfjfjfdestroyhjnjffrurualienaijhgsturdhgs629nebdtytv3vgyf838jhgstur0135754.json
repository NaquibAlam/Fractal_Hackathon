I placed the order in late November or early December. All throughout their website it was stated that shipments would be made in around 10 days. Four or five months is NOT 10 days.\nThe trees arrived March 10, as much later promised. Our area was reeling from the first real cold snap of the season, with night time lows around 5F. I called and was advised I could store the saplings in a dark cold location, which I did. I actually planted the trees March 22. I do not know yet if the trees have survived. I'll have to wait and see.\nMy suggestion for this nursery is to state on their website that delivery is not necessarily 10 days and to confirm to the customer the shipping date PRIOR TO PLACING THE ORDER.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T08:48:59.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

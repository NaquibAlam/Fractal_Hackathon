The website was easy to navigate and check out was a breeze. After searching long and hard, Flighthub definitely gave me the best price and shortest trip available. I chose the flexible dates option and with only a 2 day difference, I was able to save $340! Not only that, the flight was 8 hours shorter compared to other flights which I would of paid more for to begin with. So with a savings of $340, shorter flight, I am one happy camper and will definitely return! Thank you Flighthub!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:25:06.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

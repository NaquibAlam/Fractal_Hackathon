It was beautiful.\nCheck in was fast and easy. The cabin was just a 5 minutes away\nThere were 4 of us- 2 couples. The 2nd floor bedroom is open to the game room and sound does travel since the stairwell is open.\nThe beds were very comfortable. We loved that they gave us extra pillows, some soft and some firm. There is actually a full size hide-a-bed on the 2nd floor in addition to the king size bed.\nThe hot tub was perfect! It is under roof, too, so even in the rain it can be used.\nWe have rented other cabins in the area where they were very scant on trash bags, toilet paper, and paper towels. Not so with outrageous cabins. They supplied extra of all of these.\nThe only complaint we had was the kitchen was not as well supplied as it could have been. There were only 4 dinner plates, so we ran the dishwasher after each meal. There were only 3 wine glasses. We really needed a large skillet, but there were only 2 small ones.\nWe will rent from Outrageous Cabins the next time we are visiting the area!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:17:00.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

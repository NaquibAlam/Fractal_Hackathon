I opted for the least expensive \"e-cig\"/vaporizer, which was all I can afford at the time and it was enough to deal with my nicotine cravings AND not even want to smoke a traditional cigarette. They have more nicotine strengths than other companies and a TON of different flavors so I will never get bored.\nGreat customer service. Depending on the time of day you complete your order, it usually ships same day and it usually arrives within 2-4 days. I am a loyal and happy, happy customer! Thanks Totally Wicked! I owe you my (hopefully much longer) life!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:29:36.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

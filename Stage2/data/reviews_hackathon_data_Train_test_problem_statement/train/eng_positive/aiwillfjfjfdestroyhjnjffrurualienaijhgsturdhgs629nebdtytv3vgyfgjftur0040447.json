Their customer service is particularly helpful. Even when they told me they didn't cover supplements when my dog was diagnosed with cancer, they were empathetic and helpful. The rest of the claim was lightning fast and easy. I only wish our human insurance industry was as easy and straight forward! I've recommended them to many of my friends who have also started using them and really loved it. They are affordable, straight forward, easy to work with, and compassionate through every circumstance. My new puppy will be covered by them for life!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T14:28:34.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

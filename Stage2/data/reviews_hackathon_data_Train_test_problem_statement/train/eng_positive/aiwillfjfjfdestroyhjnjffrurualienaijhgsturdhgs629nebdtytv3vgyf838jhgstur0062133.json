I was a little disappointed to get an email asking me to send my design before giving me an estimate since the point of an estimate is to know how much you will be paying before you go ahead and design or purchase your items.\nNonetheless I went ahead and settled for the sizes available in the automated calculator and received my order very fast.\nThe quality is pretty good, being a photographer I'm quite picky about that because my flyers display some of my photos and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality.\nSome of my business cards where not cut even but I've notice this is pretty standard when bulk buying with most companies.\nTheir customer service is amazing, they answered all my questions and where very helpful.\nOverall I'm very happy with the results and looking forward to use all these goodies at my trade show and will definitely reorder from them in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T23:42:01.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

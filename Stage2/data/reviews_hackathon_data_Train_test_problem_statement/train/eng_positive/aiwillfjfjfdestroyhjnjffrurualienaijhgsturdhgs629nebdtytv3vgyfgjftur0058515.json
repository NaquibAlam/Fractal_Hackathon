I left a landing strip in my pubic area. I started this process a year ago and I can tell you that results start from the very first session. Not dramatic but noticeable. I decided to try laser because I was really unhappy about ingrown hairs in my pubic region as well as ongoing hair growth on my back. I had tried to maintain a clean landing strip but the shaving caused many ingrown hairs and scars. The LaserAway technicians are super professional and made sure that hair was removed from shaft, genitals and butt area.. LaserAway team is really great about handling these sensitive areas!!! After three sessions, I noticed fewer and fewer ingrown hairs as well as a noticeable change in skin smoothness and less hair regrowth. After six sessions, there was almost no hair regrowth and now my pubic and butt area are smooth and free from hair and no ingrown hairs. I wanted a small landing strip in the front and it turned out to look exactly like I wanted, cute and pretty. Two points of validation on this. I went to the doctor for a physical about a month ago and the female assistant saw my area and landing strip and as she had me sit in the chair she said \"very pretty\". Then I went for a massage the other day and the therapist actual said \"How cute!\" when she saw my area and landing strip. The really neat thing about it now is that my skin is actually as smooth or smoother than satin! The other great benefit is that a year later the scars left over from shaving and ingrown hairs are about 99% gone. I could not have expected a better result. Super happy about LaserAway!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:43:33.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

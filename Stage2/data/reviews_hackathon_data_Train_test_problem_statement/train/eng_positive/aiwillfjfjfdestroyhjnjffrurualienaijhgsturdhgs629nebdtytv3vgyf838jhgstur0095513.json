What is being done to minimize or limit the amount of cancelations cause the 5 minute mark is not fair for drivers. I can drive over 7 miles in 5 minutes just to have someone cancel the ride just before the 5 minute mark and we get nothing but lost gas\nAlso line rides are horrible for drivers, we drive for over 30 minutes and make 2 or 3 stops just to make 10 bucked total.\nOn rider pays 6.50 and other pays 3.00 for over 15 miles and 30 min and with booking fees and your 25% you make almost the same as the driver and you didn't pay any gas. Not a fare deal for the driver.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:11:15.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

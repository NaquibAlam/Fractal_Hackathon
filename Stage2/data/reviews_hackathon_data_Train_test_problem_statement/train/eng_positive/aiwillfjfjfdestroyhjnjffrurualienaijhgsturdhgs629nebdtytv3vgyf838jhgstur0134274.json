Tracking is basically useless and provides very little detail and in top of shipping delays, my order had three shipping companies involved, you also need to deal with customs. I like Wiggle but I'd like them a lot more if shipping was solid and predictable. Although, to be fair. As soon as you ad customs in the mix all bets are off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:26:20.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We were not disappointed.\nThe hoped for “small group” was just that; only two of us in Nepal, six of us for the time spent in Delhi, Varanasi, Agra, Ranthambore, and Jaipur; down to four for Udaipur, Mumbai and Aurangabad; and back to two of us for Cochin and Kerala Backwaters. The small numbers allowed the Tour Director and Guides to provide us with individual attention and flexibility which would not have been possible in a large group.\nAccommodation and food was exceptional. Easy Tours had advised us that the hotels in Nepal and Varanasi might not be quite as good as the others but they too were totally acceptable and offered everything one could want. Staff were attentive, food delicious (we ate buffet the whole way but á la carte international fare was available), everything was scrupulously clean, wi fi was a little “iffy” in places but that was not the hotels’ fault. Lunches were taken in good and surprisingly cheap restaurants recommended by the guides. Nobody in our group suffered stomach upsets.\nArpita, our Guest Relations Manager, phoned several times to ensure everything was to our satisfaction and our guides and drivers were professional and exceptional in every way.\nRaja Gautam in Nepal had the knack of showing us exactly what we needed to see in a relaxed manner, added in a couple of interesting walks, and immersed us in Nepalese history, politics, religions and life-style, so we came away with a much better understanding of this little known country.\nIn India, our Tour Director, Hitesh Sharma, who travelled with us by plane and mini-bus, from Delhi to Mumbai and all stops in between, was fantastic. Hitesh has an encyclopaedic knowledgeable of his country and an enthusiasm to match. He is also personable and incredibly kind and considerate. Nothing was too much trouble. He, along with local guides and our drivers, notably Deepak, did everything possible to ensure our trip was comfortable and smoothly and safely run. We will never forget the little bar of chocolate at the start of the day’s itinerary, the cough sweets for those suffering from traveller’s cough, the readily available supplies of cold drinking water, the hand sanitizer at every stop, and last but not least, the breathtaking driving expertise!\nIn Cochin, our number reduced to two, we were royally treated by Francis (facilitator), Vinayan (a relaxed and highly knowledgeable guide), and Thilakam (driver) all of whom went out of their way to ensure our stay was informative, entertaining and individual. Aside from the anticipated tour programme, Easy Tours arranged (at a small charge) an unexpected highlight - a day tour of an Eco-Village, with lunch and a rest-room provided as our flight did not leave until late in the evening. Our driver Thilak’s great pride in this, his own village, his knowledge about tropical fauna and flora, and a visit to the village school and a local home, gave us an insight to the area which we would not otherwise have had.\nWe cannot speak highly enough of Easy Tours, their organisational skills, the quality of their staff and the high standards they impose every step of the way. We recommend them wholeheartedly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T05:06:41.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

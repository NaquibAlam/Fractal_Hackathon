We searched the internet for so many different places but couldn't decide on a place to go. Finally, with only 5 days before Christmas, we contacted Dyonne at Costa Rican Vacations. I told her that we would like a memorable 10 day stay. I didn't expect her to actually find accommodations on such short notice, but she surprised us with a complete solution. We absolutely loved the first location in Jaco beach; and although we didn't love the second hotel, I could tell that Dyonne had listened very closely to my requirements when she was planning. The travel experience team was very responsive to our needs when we had issues with a tour guide and was absolutely amazing in making a last minute change to get us back to San Jose early enough on the last day to take advantage of the wonderful culture of the Costa Rican people on an awesome city tour. We rarely vacation in the same place twice as there are so many wonderful places in the world, but I can say that Costa Rica is a place where we will return. And when we do, you can bet that we will book with Dyonne at Costa Rican Vacations!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:50:13.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

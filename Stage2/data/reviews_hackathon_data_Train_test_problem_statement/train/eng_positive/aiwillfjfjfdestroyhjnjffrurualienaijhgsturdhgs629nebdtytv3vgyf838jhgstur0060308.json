This might be a 3 hr course for someone with base knowledg of laws and regulations but certainly not for someone new to boating...took me about 2 full days to complete all the chapters/tests and the final exam. There is so much information to take in i dont see how any one without a photographic memory could possibly pass these tests by simple reading and reviewing the chapters and to think a child (12-15) could even pass these tests is rediculous. There is a lot of repetativeness in the chapters that make them longer than necessay and some questions were not even covered in the chapters. I will says the visuals were very helpful but this test was much more complicated and time consuming than implied in the begining.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T12:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T22:52:06.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

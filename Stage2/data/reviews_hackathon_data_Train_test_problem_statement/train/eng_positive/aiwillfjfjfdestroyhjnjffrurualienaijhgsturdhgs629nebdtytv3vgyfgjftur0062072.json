Our salesman Eric McKenzie couldn't have been more helpful or professional. He made sure we got the vehicle we were looking for at a great price. Excellent financing and low low down payment considering our credit was less than perfect, the optional plans and warranty packages to protect us without the hardsale. We'd recommend DriveTime to any and all of our friends and family looking for a great vehicle at a great price from a company that keeps it's promises.

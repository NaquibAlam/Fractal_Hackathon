As far as the Rover site it is easy to use and seems like a good way to search and get in touch with people that sit, care for and walk your pets. The features of drop in cards were nice, straight to text is also nice when on vacation. Overall the Rover platform seems like a good one and as someone who has been needing a pet sitter instead of dog boarding for years this was a great find. But, our pet sitter is the real reason I feel so positive, I'm not sure how much Rover would be able to help if that had been a negative experience. That said, my pet sitter also was able to vouch for another sitter and that extends the circle so it is a nice way of building community too. I highly recommend giving Rover a try, and I think that the meet and greet before booking is a good step that they have built in to the process.

We did, however, have problems with our first puzzle--snowmen--I had to actually glue several of the faces back onto their puzzle piece. They had come completely off their backs! Never had that happen before. We have just completed our second puzzle and are ready to start on our third...no problems with the second one. I love how putting a puzzle together brings the family together for a fun time from our 10 year old grandson to his Poppy who turns 65 next month.

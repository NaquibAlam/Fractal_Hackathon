The system was easy to install, all the sensors are wireless and preprogrammed,... programming the base station took a bit longer than I expected, but it connected right off the bat, (through the AT&T network), and it connects almost immediately every time I log into it. I also got the Alarm.com smart thermostats, which I highly recommend, I can control the heat through them and I also get a real time temperature reading through the app on my phone. It can be programmed to give you a low temp alarm, a temperature you can set yourself not a predetermined temp like other companies. In the two and a half months I have this system, this feature forewarned me, (on two occasions just in the last 18 days), when my boiler failed and the inside temp dropped below the threshold I set while I was away. Either incident could’ve been a disaster with the outside temps in the 20’s, headed home immediately; (very happy I didn't come home to frozen (broken) pipes and flooding issues). I also have cameras installed, you can peek in whenever you want and the images are pretty good compared to other systems. I’m very happy with the system, keep up the good work Link!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:17:50.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I've been searching online and offline to find the ideal person or place that could take high quality photos of my product with quick turnaround time. I contacted Squareshot and after speaking with Alex, I felt comfortable to give that company a try. Alex was very professional in responding to my questions and clearly understood my needs. I love the photos they produced. The photos came out perfect with quick turnaround time - just the way I needed them. I've tried several different photographers with this same product and Squareshot produced the best of all. For the quality they produce, their price is more than reasonable. Excellent job Squareshot. This will be my stop for all my product photo needs! I highly recommend Squareshot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T09:33:29.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

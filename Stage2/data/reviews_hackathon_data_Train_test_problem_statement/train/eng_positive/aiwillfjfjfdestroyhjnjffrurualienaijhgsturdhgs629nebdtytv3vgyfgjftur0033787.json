First of all, I had questions in regards to them installing a Zagg cover if the screen had to be replaced. Shauna was great to work with and told me how to enter the order. So I dropped the phone off and later called customer service to see if the screen actually had to be repaired. Jessica at customer service was awesome, said the screen needed to be replaced and I paid for the service. I then got a call about 2 hours later and Jessica said their repair team got the Zagg cover off and the screen was actually not damaged. It was the Zagg screen that was cracked. Jessica refunded the entire amount and said there would be no charge to install the Zagg cover. What a GREAT and HONEST company! I am glad I got an email a few days later to review them. I tried to leave a not on the Dave Glover website but couldn't. Would recommend this company over any other cell phone repair companies. Nice to see old time values of honesty and good customer service back in a business nowadays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:30:30.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

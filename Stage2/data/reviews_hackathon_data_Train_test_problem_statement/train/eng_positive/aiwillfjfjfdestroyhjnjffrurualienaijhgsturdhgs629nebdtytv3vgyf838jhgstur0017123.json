A little research via model number and a replacement was found. I ordered it and with 2 day shipping, had it in hand for only $58. I studied a few similar videos for this screen and changed it out in less than 15 minutes. It works fine with no issues. Best Buy wanted $300 and the laptop for 3 weeks to fix. Do it yourself and save the cash. Very happy with this experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:09:18.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

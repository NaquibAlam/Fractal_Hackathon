Indeed, good is not enough --- I would say brilliant! I was kept up to date at every stage, and even the item you could not supply merited a very friendly reply and explanation from John Galvin. The lens for an indicator light supplied was the correct model, very reasonably priced, and well packed so that it arrived in undamaged condition. Many thanks to Louise and to John Galvin for an enjoyable buying experience.\nKind regards - John Oldham ( edward@ Manx.net )", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:10:14.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

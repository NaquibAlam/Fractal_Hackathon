Cooking after working 10-12 hours? Nah I'm good, I also HATE cooking. It's messy and long and like stated above, NAH. But munchery has been thee best thing ever.. freshly cooked meals whenever I want and I buy dinner the night before or a couple days of meals in advance and I don't have to worry about grocery shopping, cooking and cleaning the mess, SIGN ME UP!!!! Menu rotates so I don't have to eat the same boring shizz all the time, also my delivery drivers give me updates on when my meal is gonna get there and it's always on time! Bless this and bless the munchery!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T14:24:49.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The instructions were helpful, though I did have a problem that was not addressed. The sign is corrugated plastic, which produced a proliferous number of bubbles. For 20 minutes I pricked half of them, but aborted that thinking I may be doing harm plus the tediousness and amount of time it was taking, and that if it could just last long enough for a sale everything would be OK.\nAlso, I took extra time to give this feedback because the original photo was unsendable, so I drove the hour back to the property to use a different camera to get another photo. That was good in a sense, because I got to look at how the lettering was holding up. Unfortunately, because of the time I forgot to look up close to see how the pricks were doing. However, from 10 feet away the lettering is holding up good.\nOne other thing is that I shouldn't have to accept the Terms and Conditions of TrustPilot. DIY is the one using this website to have me give a rating; I'm not being paid and have other things to do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:17:53.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We called one place and was rudely told they were closed, then we called Storage West in Tempe. Christy and Eric are a married couple that run the place and they have been so sweet from the very start, and we can tell they really enjoy their jobs. A simple tour to get familiar with the place, the friendly smiles, offers for help, the clean and secure facility, all of the little touches really make a difference.

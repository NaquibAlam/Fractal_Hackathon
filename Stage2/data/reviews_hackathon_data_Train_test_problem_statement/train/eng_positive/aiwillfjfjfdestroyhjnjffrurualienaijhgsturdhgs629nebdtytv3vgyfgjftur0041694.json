Surprised that RLE offered transitions at such a low price, I decided to give them a shot. I sent in a pair of my Ray Bans and tracked them to make sure they got to RLE. I originally thought that they did not receive my frames because USPS tracking deemed the location \"undeliverable as addressed\", however, the next day, it showed them as delivered. Unsure whether they got the frames, I sent an email an was told they had not received them yet. Worried, I requested that just the lenses be sent to me in case the frames were returned to me by the USPS. I was updated when my order into the lab, when they were finished, and when they were shipped out. Worried about the location of my frames, I sent an email to RLE the day the package was to be delivered and was assured the order included my frames. The best part was that RLE shipped my frames UPS next day air so I got them the day after I was notified that they were ready. I now own a nice pair of transitions at a reasonable price! Thanks RLE!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T23:25:53.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

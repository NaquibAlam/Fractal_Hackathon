Shae was prompt, informative and answered every question with the details I was looking for. Nothing was a bother and our requests were respectfully attended to eg booking hotels with balcony views on a high floor.\nThe guides and drivers were wonderful and always aware of our comfort, safety and personal interests. They shared knowledge and ensured the tour organisation went smoothly. All arrangements went like clockwork, with the guides mostly ahead of the clock! We never had to wait anywhere.\nWe were very impressed with the service from Eclipse and the tour companies they used in South America.

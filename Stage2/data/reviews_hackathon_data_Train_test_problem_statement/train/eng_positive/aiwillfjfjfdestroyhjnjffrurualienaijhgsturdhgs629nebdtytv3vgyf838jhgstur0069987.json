There are reviews of sitters, what their preferences are (i.e weight, allowed on couch ,walk schedules). It cost me roughly half of what I would have paid at the kennel and I know my dog had a better time in a quiet/ chill environment at my sitter's place. I will definitely be using this service again and now have peace of mind to be able to book a vacation without having to worry about my dog struggle in a kennel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T13:14:16.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

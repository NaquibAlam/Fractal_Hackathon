This way, I tend to get the best deal possible. When I compare the flight price with the actual airline's website, Flighthub always seems to come out cheaper.\nThe one hiccup I had once was when Flighthub had to cancel my ticket within 4 hours from booking it because the airline had not issued a ticket for my flight to Flighthub. Fortunately I was able to quickly rebook at the airline's website shortly thereafter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:54:05.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My partner and I drove out from BC, the rest of my family drove out from Ottawa, save for my dad who had flown out ahead of time to be with his father. Interestingly enough, the visit with my Pepere was a gift he was able to astonishingly grant to each of his 8 children, 18 grandhildren, and even a few of his great grandchildren. Joking and sharing stories to pass on what he has learned and simply being in a graceful state of bliss. It was a real gift. A blessing. At the end of it all, my entire family was left with now trying to figure out our journeys home. As an independant contractor, spending time away from home can be costly. We dont get vacation/sick/compassionate leave days. And my options had become, wait here for some of the family to drive back out in two weeks time, or fly back. I needed to get home. After a launch of searches for airfare options on the internet, Flighthub rose to the top and made life that much easier. Cheapest seats, least hassle. In a rollercoaster ride of grief and closure with family, I needed cheap and hassle-free.

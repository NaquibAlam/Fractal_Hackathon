I was speaking with someone throughout the entire process and was never left in the dark with what was going on from day 1. The system used to make updates to my website is very easy (and I'm not a tech head) giving me confidence to always update my website with new pictures and information keeping my site fresh. The design I could not be happier with, I spoke with a graphic designer directly throughout the build of the website and he nailed it. But the best part of it all is the support. If I have a question on how to make an update to my website, I just call up or send an email and they walk me through it. Its refreshing not being put through to an overseas call centre, you just know you are speaking to someone in Australia and they are all friendly and very helpful. Will definitely recommend to friends & clients in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T17:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T18:50:19.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

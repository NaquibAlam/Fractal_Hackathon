I shopped online for the best quality, price & style that i loved.\nI was torn btw 2 options & it came down to price. Gardner White was more expensive but the brands & quality stood out.\nI decided to go to each store to physically touch my top choices & rate the experience with the store staff.\nTom Neely was my assistant at the Canton, MI location. He was prompt, Thorough, knowledgeable and really friendly. Our conversation went beyond furniture to my personal preference within my budget. We also talked about comic book movies & our DIY hiccups. I enjoyed the experience with Tom.\nI learned something about mattresses & box springs. This was a very new experience for me & Tom helped me reduce my anxiety & fear.\nAs a survivor or trauma, Apart of my healing is \"self care\". I took a chance & bought myself a new bedroom set with a quality mattress. Tom had no clue he was apart of my healing journey. Im happy to create a new sanctuary for rest & not feel guilt for my purchase.\nI got the Queen Saxon 5 piece set.\nThanks Tom\nPs- countdown to \"Logan\" release! #Wolverine", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:23:40.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

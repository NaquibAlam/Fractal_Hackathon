After installing it, I noticed the picture was not as clear I has expected. I immediately all Tadi Brothers and talked to Eddie. After about a 5 minute conversation, He recommended that I use a wired system since my rig was almost 60' long. He gave me full credit for the one I purchased and my new one at my home in 3 days! Now, 2 years later, my wife and I were at the Tampa Super RV Show where I saw that Tada Brother had a booth set up. I went over to look and inquire about upgrading my camera to a Hi-Def camera. To my surprise, Eddie was running the booth... We talked for a few minutes and I purchased (at a discount) the new Hi-Def camera that he recommended. Now again, today, couple of years has past and I decided that I wanted a wireless camera that had better reception / display. I called Eddie, told him what I wanted but it had to be compatible with my current monitor and he again gave me a discount and it will be here in 3-4 days.\nI wouldn't think of purchasing any of the equipment that Tadi Brothers sells from any other vendor! Give them a try, you will be glad you did!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:26:48.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The invitation options are so impressive, modern and easy to use. The ability to add music, maps, photos, as much information as you want really, is brilliant. The program takes the stress out of organising an event for the planner with the ability to email, text or Facebook invitations, and makes it easy for guest to reply instantly. Overall, it is so professional, and helps makes sure no errors are made by the party planner, due to the way you can personalise the data needed and collected (attendee numbers, dietary requirements, invitations not opened, etc). The staff at Greenvelope were so helpful and prompt with any query I had. I'm so glad I stumbled across this program, and will use it for all my future events. ðŸ˜€", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T14:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T05:41:20.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

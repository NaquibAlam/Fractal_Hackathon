Weirdly, the process reminds me of online dating websites from 10 years ago. You basically have to trust that people are basically good. After all you are giving them a key to your house and free access to all of your possessions! The process could be open to abuse on both sides which is what happened to online dating so hopefully TrustedHousesitters will have a solution to that particularly for new sitters who haven't yet been reviewed. Maybe some insurance?\nThe website seems to have thought about most things including creating a welcome pack, calendars and flexibility to contact available sitters. The whole site is very intuitive and works across browsers. We have had a great first experience and have already booked our Housesitter again!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T13:07:57.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

So easy going and helpful, and didn't pressure us into increasing our budget, or buying anything until we were certain. They encouraged me to test drive as many cars as I wanted to get a feel for the cars. They were such a pleasure to do business with, we came back a week later for my partner to buy his first car too! Great service, would definitely recommend! :D", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T09:21:19.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Michelle was a fantastic guide. She showed us all interesting placec and explained evereyting in a comprehensive manner so it was easy to get the big picture how the different influences on the cities development are linked.also she gave us a lot of hints and tips where to go for having dinner or go dancing. It was fun to follow her on the bike while she was picking the best route for us where we could see everthing and still it hasnt been too crowded. I really recommend this tour, its a relaxed and fun way to get to know Barcelona.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T13:57:20.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

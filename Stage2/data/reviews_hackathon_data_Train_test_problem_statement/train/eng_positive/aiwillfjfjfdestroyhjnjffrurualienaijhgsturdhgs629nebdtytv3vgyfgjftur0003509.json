Every site gave me a Quote: of $1500 and above but when FlightHub pulled it all out for just under $900, let's say before it could sink in that the price was real, I didn't waste a fraction of a second to book it.\nIt was my first time using the FlightHub and as they say, \"You never forget your first\", oh boi, ain't they right. I'm never gonna forget this. From now onwards, FlightHub is my guy for everything related to travel. I can't wait to brag about this great deal I got to my friends. I cannot thank FlightHub enough. There's a reason they are known as \"Flight\"HUB\" because they are the freakin HUB of world class flights with relatively great offers.\nI'm looking forward to my trip and the money that I saved from this deal, boi looks like I don't need to save more for the next trip, the money I saved from this deal is gonna do the trick for me. Thanks a ton guys, thanks a ton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:59:20.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I wasn't able to find anybody in our area that could take pictures with the German specifications. Luckily I came across mypassportphotos.com. This service is excellent. We were able to take the pictures at home and upload them in minutes. It made it so easy, especially with my baby, since he was releaxed and comfortable. I used the expert service to make sure the pictures were acceptable and had them sent to my local CVS. The turnaround was so quick, I was able to pick them up the same day! Easy, fast, fantastic!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:08:02.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

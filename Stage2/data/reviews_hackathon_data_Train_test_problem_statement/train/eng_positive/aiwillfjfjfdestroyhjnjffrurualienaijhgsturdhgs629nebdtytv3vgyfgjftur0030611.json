Everything worked well, except my bed. My bed has three height levels, the lowest is meant for using with a box spring, which I am not, and they assembled it in the lowest one. I noticed that the mattress was very low, kind of uncomfortable, but I thought that it was a bad bed from Ikea (Hemnes), but after researching on it, the bed is actually good, the issue was with the height level used (lowest). Anyway, I changed it to the second one, and now it's ok, but I had to spend some time on it, which was not the initial idea when I hired them. Besides that, everything worked well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:28:16.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

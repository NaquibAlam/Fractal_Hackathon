Everytime I have compared them to the rates offered by the banks they have been cheaper. 1-2 times a month I transfer from my Australian account to my New Zealand account. It takes approx 1-2 days for my funds to reach Currrncy Online and 1-2 days for them to be deposited in my New Zealand account. I receive text message notifications throughout the whole process so I know how the transfer is progressing. Customer service is very helpful, I think it was a little daunting for me at first, but they talked me through everything, and now I find the service very easy to use. Highly recommended if you want a few more bucks in your pocket. Also recommend for travelers! My parents used Currency Online when traveling Europe for 3 months, they opened a bank account in Germany and topped it up when funds were low from their Australian account. Avoided all OS bank fees and got a better exchange rate than if they had used their Australian cards in the ATM's.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:27:42.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My parents are working more puzzles, partly for my father's therapy and partly for fun. We all love jigsaws and White Mountain pieces are thicker and seem easier to handle. Some pieces are a bit rough around the edges but no big deal. I would suggest more 300 and 550 piece puzzles. We all have limited space and they enjoy finishing a bit quicker.

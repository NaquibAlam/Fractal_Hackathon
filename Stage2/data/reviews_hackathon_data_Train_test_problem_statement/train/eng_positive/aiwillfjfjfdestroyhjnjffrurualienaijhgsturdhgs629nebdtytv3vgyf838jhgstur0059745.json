When copies are that cheap, it makes everyone, myself included, wonder if this site is on the up and up.\nBefore buying from here, I tried to buy from Kinguin, and my buyer protection on my credit card refused to let me make the purchase. So even though many people have had no problems there, that sets off some red flags for me.\nSo, I saw this site running a deal for an OEM Win 10 Pro digital download for 40 bucks and decided to take the plunge. No buyer protections flagged, Got my download key right away. Downloaded the USB installer from Windows directly, and the key they gave me worked just fine. Authenticated instantly, without a hitch.\nTLDR;\nI was skeptical, but this site delivered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T11:16:06.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I will comment though that while the big items are reasonably priced (with respect NY prices, dollar conversion, and GST and the very expensive shipping from the US), but ancillaries like Li-Ion batteries, stands, and bags are relatively very expensive to buy here.\nStill, the old adage \"caveat emptor\" applies to on-line shopping as it does elsewhere, so potential buyers can do comparisons themselves.\nA perfectly satisfactory experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T22:03:17.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Houzz made it so much easier to decorate in the style chosen for the next 20+ years (LOL) by providing not only the decorator items, furnishings and special touch items but also provided access to advice and experience of interior decorators, contractors and all related professionals to making a house a home. The customer service provided by Houzz is excellent and efficient. Their Customer Service department has been very helpful and works to resolve any issues expeditiously. Highly recommend Houzz as a go to source when redoing any aspect of a home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:52:37.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

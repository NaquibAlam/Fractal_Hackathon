No issues with financing, numbers, etc...One piece that was left out was the origination fee, which I understand after the fact. However, when we were discussing numbers, this wasn't mentioned. Only at the point of clicking \"yes, fund me\" did it show a line item for this.\nMy only other issue was my Funding date was a Tuesday, and the first payment was Thursday the same week. 2 days doesn't seem like an adequate amount of time for a 'weekly' billing to take place. So, from the money I borrowed, more than $3k was taken before I could set any plans in motion. But it's okay, Like I said the process was easy and I asked to borrow more than I needed. If you're going this route, factor these costs into your expected loan amount.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T21:50:18.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

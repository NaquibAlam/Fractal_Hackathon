So let's start at the beginning;-) I was new to the whole \"planet\" of vaping...and just got online to look for a Rockstar place. I burned through a handful then stumbled onto POTV. I liked what I saw. I studied their site and products...and eventually ordered the Flowermate V5 Mini Pro (because I \"thought\" I wanted a super small vaporizer).\nThe \"Mini\" arrived within 2 days of placing the order. Bam! That was Rockstar no doubt. And the Mini was exactly as it was described on POTV's site as well as what I researched elsewhere. I gave it a whirl for a week. But quickly grew impatient with the short battery life and need to refill so frequently. And the joke was on me because I was the one who thought I wanted/needed a super small vaporizer. And I got it. It's like losing a contact if you drop it;-) The damn thing is tiny.\nDon't get me wrong. Again, if I was truly looking for a very small, portable vape, something that I could chill with discretely, the Mini may have been my choice. But alas, I decided I wanted to give something else a try (mostly because my imagination got the best of me = I thought I would have a need to chill with a vaporizer at a party or something...but then remembered I don't go to parties)...and emailed POTV about the return process.\nI received feedback from Jerry promptly. He helped smooth the return process, as did Solan ultimately. (Yes, Solan is someone's name. Freagin' sweet name!! I'm officially jealous). Anyway, thank you both!! And sorry, Jerry, for not being as stoked about your name;-) You ultimately made up for it with your ever-so-wise advice. Maybe change your name to Jedi?! Seems more fitting. But then again, maybe not. When you get mindblowing guidance from \"Jerry\", it double blows your mind. Crap, now Jerry is really gonna start to feel bad about his name not being as cool as Solan's?!\nMoving on. The bonus is that this is where the mega rockstar experience started! Jerry Jerry bo-berry Banana fanna fo-ferry helped guide me to my mucho awesome Arizer Extreme Q (We are bestest of buds now!!! We, as in me and the Extreme Q!! I don't think Jerry considers me his friend...yet!) Jerry figured the Extreme Q was what I would dig after asking some mindful questions about what I was looking for in my vape experience.\nI took Jerry's advice and had the darn Arizer Extreme Q on my ol' desktop in 2 days from placing the order (again!!!). Damn! These guys must be cousins of Zappos or something?!\nJerry must be hiding some crystal ball looking vaporizer somewhere (I didn't see one on the POTV website...yet!) because his guidance was spot on. I freagin' love the Extreme Q. I love the flexibility of it (pun kinda intended...per the whip). I love the quality of the vape it generates. I love how sophisticated it is. And sure, not as awesome as the Volcano, but also a few hundo less. It's just perfecto for what I want out of my vaporizer at this point. Haven't tried the bag. But I do likes whipping me some herbs! So damn simple to use. Now I just gotta figure out how to strap it to my head (like those hard hats with the beers on the side) so I can enjoy it on the fly! Seriously though, the Extreme Q is a solid desktop vaporizer...something that I could afford...and Jerry knocked it outta da park by guiding me to it! Thank you, Brother!\nLong review coming to end, I just gotta say \"thank you to the entire team at POTV!\" From my research to date, there's a lot of options (and crappy ones at that) out there for vaporizing gear/products. But POTV has proven to me that they have awesome products and even more awesomerester (yes, I know that's not a word...yet!) service to back up their products.\nOh, and by the way, I received a full refund on the Mini within a matter of days from returning it. Yes, I do carefully handle products that I am not sure I am gonna keep. So that may have had something to do with the smooth return process. But as we all now, not every place online makes returns easy (regardless of how careful you are with the product and return packaging + process).\nFortunately, POTV is the fizz schnizzle! I feel like I found the best place on the planet to help guide me on my vaping journey! They should call themselves the planet of the vapes. Instead, they call themselves POTV?! What the heck does that even mean? Oh wait. Crap. I'm stupid. Oh well, time to hit my Extreme Q so I can remember how smart I am!!\nSuuuw t job, POTV! And I gotta give a shout out to the Vape Critic dude because he is how I discovered POTV to begin with. Nice work, man!

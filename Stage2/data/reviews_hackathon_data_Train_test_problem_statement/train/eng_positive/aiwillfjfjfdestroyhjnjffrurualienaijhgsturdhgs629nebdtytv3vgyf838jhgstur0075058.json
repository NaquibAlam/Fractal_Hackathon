I went to Antique Lamp Supply on a whim. Much to my surprise, they have the greatest selection. I was able to find exactly what I needed. I have two lamps I use together. This chimney matched perfectly. I ordered two in case there was a difference, so now I have a extra one. I am so happy I found this site. In addition to having what I needed, the prices are very good and the order was received quickly. I only had to wait three days to get my replacement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:18:15.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

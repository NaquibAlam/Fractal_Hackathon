No, they are not all like new, but that's okay because the important part is what's on the pages. I always check thriftbooks before buying any book I find interesting in a store because it is such a great deal! Three of the $3.49 books is enough for free shipping (order of $10 or more) which honestly couldn't be much better. They don't take long to come, just depends on how far it has to travel. I love this site and think it's great, I would - do - recommend to everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:02:00.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

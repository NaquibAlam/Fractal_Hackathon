It was four very full, very productive days. I walked away with a firm knowledge of the contents of the PMBOK and armed with study tools and an exam strategy guide. We had a small enough class that allowed our instructor, Michael, to thoroughly answer everyone's questions, but it was large enough that we had a broad range of fields and experience levels to draw knowledge from. Michael is an excellent instructor: clear, attentive, and knowledgeable.\nAs soon as you register for the class, you are given access to study materials right away. After you complete the class, you continue to have access to Project Management Academy's online study materials, but you also have the physical materials provided in class including a copy of the PMBOK, a binder with all of the slides and notes from class, an exam strategy guide, and some fantastic study guides. Using all of this in combination with the online materials and practice exams, I easily passed the PMP about a month after completing the course.\nProject Management Academy offers a pass guarantee provided you complete the recommended training. Thanks to the exceptional instruction in class and the fantastic study materials provided, I won't need to take them up on their offer! If you are looking for a prep class for the PMP, this is an excellent choice!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:55:28.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

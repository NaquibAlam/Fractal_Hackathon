Didn't know what to expect, but delighfully surprised how organized and involved you maintain DesignCrowd.\nWe thought we might get an awful recording, or deal with long hold times, etc. But that didn't happen.\nYou answered, listened to our questions and concerns and immediately handled the requests at hand.\nKnow it wasn't you that applied for the designers to add that \"extra fee for requesting them\" when we never did. Thank you for taking care of that as well. All around FABULOUS service you provide.\nIt really could not have been easier, more simplified and successful.\nThank you again for making it so easy to reach so many talented people from all over the world, obtain 2 projects we are really proud of.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T17:12:17.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

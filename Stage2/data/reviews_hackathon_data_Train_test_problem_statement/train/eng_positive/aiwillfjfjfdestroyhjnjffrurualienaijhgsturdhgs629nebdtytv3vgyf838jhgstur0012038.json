We had a great time, everything arranged was fun and gave us a good view of the parts of the country we saw. I've mentioned Goway to others when talking about the trip and we met another couple in Cairns whose travel agent recommended Goway to them. They also had said they would definitely use Goway for future travels. And we had a pleasant surprise for our 30th anniversary from Goway and the Outback Pioneer Lodge - nice way to celebrate.

When I venture an opinion I want to be honest and say what I know to be true. If you continue to read and sort through this this review and find it useful, congratulations!. You're on the path to iMazing enlightenment, and will likely be satisfied, iMazing advocates and customers, as we are. We've used iMazing to back up our iDevices on our Windows 7x64 system over the past year. There are very few effective 3rd -party solutions for backing up your iDevice and files and iMazing is at the top of this short list. iMazing is everything that iTunes could've/might've/should've been, without all of the unnecessary fluff that iTunes packs around, unless you like or need that sort of thing. Imazing is indispensible if you want to backup and archive your files and apps, in the privacy and security of your own home. DigiDNA works to continually update and improve iMazing, which has resulted in a focused and finely-tuned program. Given Apple's ( iTunes) increasingly frustrating -some would say maddening- security, and the new Apple file system restrictions now coming out (Feb, 2017), it has become ever more tedious and complicated to perform the most basic of functions, a local backup, using only iTunes. A word of advice; A note first; Apple doesn't want anyone to know about its file system and they also don't want anyone fooling with their idevices. That's why Apple promotes iCloud. ICloud is bandwidth intensive, among other concerns. Yes, it's been possible (and still is, for now) to backup your iPhone or iPad to your PC/Mac with iTunes, but it's not pain-free; it's meant to confuse you. After all, why would work at backing something up on your own, when you can pay someone else, (iCloud) to do all of that? Other reviews here touch on a painful subject; if you upgrade to the next version of iOS without knowing how it's going to affect you or your iMazing backups, get ready for a shock; Apple doesn't care. As with all things, there's a learning curve with iOS. If you don't or won't take the time to read the fine print, the manual, and do research prior to allowing your device to update, please don't blame DigiNDA or iMazing. The Apple Genius people are always happy to help you, if you can get to one, for a price. I don't recommend automatically updating iOS for several months (at least) after each and every update of iOS, just because it's available. Every iOS update changes something, which will have an effect on your device, and directly affect your happiness, or unhappiness. Study, then study some more, and take time to know your device, and practice using iMazing; you'll have few problems with iMazing if you know what you are doing. Apple has iPhone and iPad manuals available free for the downloading from the App store. Read them and learn from them, and the many fine (free!) user forums available. When iOS works, it's really cool, but if it stops, you'll be unprepared and unhappy. All computers and operating systems are that way. Apple used to say 'It Just Works' and thankfully it does, most of the time, but not all. You do get out of it what effort you put into becoming your own Genius. When you think you've learned everything about your device and iOS, Apple updates and that always changes something, or everything. Now for the good iMazing review part! We purchased our new devices from Apple, and the frustration factor of using iTunes for backups was immediately an absolute drag. Older versions of iTunes won't work with newer versions of iOS, though you can still download them from Apple (so far). Unlike working with a PC, once you've updated or upgraded your iOS device, Apple doesn't permit you a do-over or go-back; you're stuck with the upgrade, bugs, excessive battery drain and everything you didn't know about. Our iDevices aren't jail broken; we wanted the security Apple provides for these units, and Apple is spending large sums to improve their security infrastructure (the jail-breakers are really having a rough time of it). It's understandable why some like jail-breaking, but we haven't partaken. Whether or not you approve of jail-breaking, iMazing is the ONLY solution you'll need to backup/restore your iDevices or files, with no iTunes frustration. IMazing runs at warp speed for us; backups are insanely fast. Having instant access to unlimited backup archives locally means not fooling with iCloud, or any cloud. Our files are backed up where we need them to be, on multiple USB dock-drives and or USB flash drives; one is in a fire-proof case. Not dealing with pricy cloud storage frees up a great deal of time and removes the expensive bandwidth/remote storage issue. We're in a remote area and have a limited ISP. The first time we tried an initial iCloud upload was also the last time; the laborious upload failed halfway through the struggle. iMazing has performed flawlessly and to date, it has never failed us. I worked on various systems and in IT for years; I'm happy as a clam with the speed, control and security iMazing provides. Our offline archives are far cheaper than online storage and we'll never run out of space. There are many who don't worry about using nameless, faceless data-centers, which can be (and are) accessed by unknowns. If you have unlimited bandwidth, or don't care about such niceties, nor the value iMazing offers, you -can- limp along with iTunes, but should you? DigiDNA has been prompt to reply to our queries and they continually improve iMazing, which deserves our support. We don't often recommend software but iMazing is exceptional at what it does. We will continue to support and recommend it as long as it is developed as a 3rd-party application and independent from Apple. If you use iMazing, you'll wonder how you got along without it. Our review isn't a paid product endorsement and I recommend iMazing without reservation. My wish-list for iMazing is very short; sadly Apple is unlikely to help with the first item, the ability to restore the original signed IPSW image anyone is allowed (by Apple no less) to download and use to upgrade your device to the next iOS version, instead of using OTA/Wi-Fi. If OTA fails, you have to start over, so iMazing can restore your backup. If your phone or tablet acts strangely and you want to restore it via DFU from scratch, you can't; you're stuck with whatever you have, and then you have to upgrade OTA, one more time. iTunes used to be able to perform this function, and still can for a limited time - when your image signature is expired or replaced with the newest iOS version, then the files is just a space hog. Secondly, I'd love to have an iMazing power user manual to print out and read from paper. Give iMazing a try; be prepared to be Amazed.

All three contacted us within days and supplied Quote: s in subsequent days.\nInterestingly, three Quote: s supplied with three technologies, String Inverters, Micro Inverters and String Inverters with Optimised panels. The technologies in two cases were based on recent aerial photogtaphy showing shading of our house across all four seasons.\nWe could easily see how orientation of the sun would affect our Panels. The computer app was also able to show proposed positionong of the panels on our roof.\nWe could see that 6kW of panels connected to an Inverter via two strings on East and West roofs would suffer little from shading.\nWe have placed an order with the Company that proposed this solution.\nVery happy with Solar Solutions, all three suppliers and the one ultimeatly chosen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:17:37.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

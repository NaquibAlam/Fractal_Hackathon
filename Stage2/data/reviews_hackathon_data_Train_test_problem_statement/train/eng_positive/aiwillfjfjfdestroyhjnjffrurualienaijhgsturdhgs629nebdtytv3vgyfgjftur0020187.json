We have been using havealook for over 3 years now and for the following reasons, we are absolutely delighted with them:\n1. Excellent value for money\n2. Simple and easy to use web update system\n3. Highly responsive customer service\nFrom time to time we need to update our web site, instead of employing an expensive IT consultant which would cost time and money, I simply log into the system and make the relevant changes.\nI am not an IT person but relatively tech savvy (which may help a little bit) however if I haven’t done an update for a month or two and forget how to do something I simply ring the service line and they walk me through it.\nWe upload files, photos, text, etc all with ease and for free. I like it because we make changes to the web site instantly and it does not waste management time or money…..\nI cannot recommend Havealook more highly.\nPS. I have used other web site management systems that use word press in my opinion Havealook's is much easier and far superior.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:23:07.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

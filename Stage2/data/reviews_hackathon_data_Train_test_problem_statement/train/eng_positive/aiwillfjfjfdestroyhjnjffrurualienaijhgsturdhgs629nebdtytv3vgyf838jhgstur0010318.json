They would not really listen and just want me to go away and pay them no matter what had happened in my situation. I became quiet distraught and afraid of how they were dealing with my situation. I heard about Optima on the radio so I turned around and contacted them. They were very professional, courteous, and patience in helping me calm down and know that I was secure. They kept me informed and abreast of what was going on with the IRS in my situation. If not for Optima I know, I would have gone crazy trying to handle the IRS. They helped me have peace of mind and solved my problem with the IRS. Thanks again for all your fine professionals help in this matter, and you helped me feel more in control with my life.

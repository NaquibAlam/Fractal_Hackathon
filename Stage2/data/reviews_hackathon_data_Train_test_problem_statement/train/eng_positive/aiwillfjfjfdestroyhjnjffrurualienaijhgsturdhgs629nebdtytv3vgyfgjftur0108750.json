I walk in, and it was a little busy, but was greeted and asked if I needed any help with anything or have questions. I told him what I was looking for and if there was any kind of specials. He did give details and even showed me an example of the price and what came with it. As I went and looked around for a sofa and loveseat set, I was greeted by others and they asked if I needed help in finding something. Other places are not this friendly , and very happy that I chose homezone for my new furniture..You guys are amazing!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T21:12:14.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

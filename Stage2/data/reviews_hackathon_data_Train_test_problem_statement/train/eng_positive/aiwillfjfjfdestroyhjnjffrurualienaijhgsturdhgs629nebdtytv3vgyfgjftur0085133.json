Had this been pointed our up front I could have saved time. After receiving my certificate I delivered it to the court clerk who informed me it was not the correct certificate, it needed to specify the court. When I contracted I drive safely staff about this problem I was at first informed that I would have to pay the $25 fee again and retake the course. In escalating this matter I found retaking the course was not necessary and that if I paid $10 for the municipal court certificate and had a Student Affidavit notarized I could obtain the certificate I needed. While this was acceptable to me I still don't understand and agree with having the student affidavit, especially since I was able to take the course and obtain an insurance certificate without the affidavit. Thanks. I am overall satisfied.\nRegards,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:22:24.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

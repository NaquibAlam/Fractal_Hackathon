To give creditability to his claim, I searched, I found, and signed up. My first problem was the unsuccessful loading of Leadpages plugins to Wordpress, frustration set in. Clicked support to live chat then explained hastily. But that didn't matter, the tech support identified the problem in seconds, explained, then executed the solution. My latest problem was confusing the redirect and autoresponder. Again, the technician broke down what each component does, added screen shots, and supporting documents for my knowledge and reference. My business account meets my needs, with help and support unlike other hosting companies. Midphase was recommended to me by a stranger online, this recommendation I vouch for from personal experience, it is quite simply the best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T09:18:38.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

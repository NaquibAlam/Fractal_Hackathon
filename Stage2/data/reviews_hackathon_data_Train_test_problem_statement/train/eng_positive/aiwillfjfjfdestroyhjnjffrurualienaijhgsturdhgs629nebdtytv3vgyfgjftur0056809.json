One corner of the matte or the mount would be a little low or a little rounded over. I assume these are cut by machine, and I expected uniformity. I realize that those edges will be covered in the frame, but that 32nd of an inch kept me from giving the full 5 stars. I will definitely continue to use their products and will recommend them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:54:16.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I ordered a snowboard helmet for my upcoming trip from a different retailer. The helmet i originally ordered was the wrong one (they had the wrong picture on the site). While they were very helpful and gave me a 10% credit on my purchase, they did not have the one i wanted. They also offered me a free return label in the event i decided to return it. So i frantically searched the internet for the correct one, and i stumbled on Erik's. It seemed they had the one i wanted and it was on SALE! Bonus!!! Once i placed my order, i received an email from them, letting me know the status of my order and to reach out if i had any concerns. I told them my only concern was getting it in time for my trip. I received an email back saying that i should receive it in plenty of time. While nothing extra had to be done to get the helmet on time, i was most impressed that i received an email from someone that i could actually reply to. And that they replied back. Online ordering has become so common for me, and i have developed a sincere appreciation for being able to contact the seller if i have any questions. i will absolutely shop with Erik's again. Oh and P.S - i haven't heard back from the other retailer since i told them i wanted to return the original helmet.

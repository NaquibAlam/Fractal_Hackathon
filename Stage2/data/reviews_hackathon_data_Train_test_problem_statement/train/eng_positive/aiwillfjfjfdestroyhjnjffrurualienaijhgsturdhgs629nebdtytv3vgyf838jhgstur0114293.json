It has multiple options for how you want your files transferred and backed up which is nice - some information I want in the csv format, others a pdf is just fine.\nWhen I had a question that I really anticipated was too late to inquire about - I thought I missed the opportunity for the offered coupon at purchase and the student discount - the customer service was blindingly fast, personable, and accommodating.\nI am so glad I found this great product and without a high cost. I have been looking for months now to just do some text message transfers, and I even tried a few other softwares which I almost immediately removed.\nThank you!\nStephanie", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T09:19:01.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The prices are great and the quality of most things, especially with products that have good sales, is decent.\nBefore ordering, I did my research and everything seems to check out. The quality is either good or \"what you pay for.\" Shoes seem to be the least popular, but that's not what I'm here for.\nI know sites that ship part of your order normally, even if another product will take longer to be available (and be shipped later with it's own package). It's convenient, but I don't like it. With this site, the order is only shipped once everything is available, which saves on the money, packaging, and fuel used in overseas shipping and makes it easier for the company to keep track of each person's orders, lessening the chance for mistakes. It might take longer, but that's okay with me.\nI've also read good things about their customer service, which is fantastic.\nI would actually recommend this place to people who want to get their partner (or themselves) cute stuff on a budget. This is also perfect for young couples who probably don't want to go spending hundreds of dollars on jewelry for each other.\nIf I can edit this review later, I will do so after I get my items.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:21:44.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

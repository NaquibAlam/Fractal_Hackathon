Can't say enough about that visit. Unfortunately, Trey was not available Tuesday, so Sam assisted us and promised to share the sale with Trey since we were his return customer. Very upstanding young man you have in Sam - he didn't have to do that. The man showed ethics! However, That is where the positivity must stop. The delivery people were awful! Nothing like our first time. They were rude, obviously in a hurry, I had found scratches on both pieces of furniture and wanted different pieces returned. They stated that \" G-W provides them a special pen for just those types of problems. (Scratch cover pen) Thank you and now, let me take a picture. \" No clean up after themselves, nothing. I was truly disappointed in the delivery service. They were AWFUL. Didn't even finish putting the bench seats together. My 68 year old, Disabled Veteran, husband had to finish them. How sad was that!?! I have loved your store twice now, on my two visits back home,, but this one really ended with sour grapes!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:55:59.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was tired & no longer fit for purpose (I'd realised that I virtually never used the bath preferring to shower). In addition, in anticipation of the effects of aging, I'd concluded that in later life it was likely that a wet room would be more accessible.\nA visit to Porcelanosa at Braehead showed a range of possibilities. I was impressed by the interest of staff in the project & their helpful suggestions about how some of their showroom designs could be adapted to meet my particular circumstances. This included advice which made high quality design more affordable.\nThe showroom manager advised that whilst Porcelanosa did not fit wet rooms (or other facilities) a number of customers had used Mathew Wright & Co for such assistance.\nAfter making contact I was impressed by Mathew's enthusiasm & commitment to realising the proposed project.\nHe offered design advice (which improved considerably what had originally been suggested). He gave firm dates for the realisation of the project & an indicative price (which turned out to be slightly less than was eventually paid. The wet room was installed during a holiday abroad (it was a delight to come back to a modern, iconic facility).\nHe also proved to be responsive to last minute requests for specific features.\nWhilst away his team had access to the house which turned out to be cleaner & tidier than when I left. He also liaised with Porcelanosa to store the various bits & pieces required for the project (none of this was stored in my home-it was delivered on a just in time basis).\nThe project was exactly what was expected. The design is bright & modern. It is easy to clean. In short it exceeds expectations. The quality of the installation is of a very high standard. Some minor design features were left until my return. This was appreciated. It allowed the placement of some of the accessories to be placed specifically where I wanted them.\nThe quality of the tiles & accessories from Porcelanosa was as expected. They were comparatively expensive but most definitely worth it.\nIn short the wet room experience exceeded expectations. It came in on budget. It came in on time. It caused no disruption.\nAs a consequence the renovation of my kitchen & the installation of a new down-stairs toilet will use Porcelanosa wall & floor tiles & Mathew Wright & Co will do the work. There can't be a greater recommendation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T22:45:16.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

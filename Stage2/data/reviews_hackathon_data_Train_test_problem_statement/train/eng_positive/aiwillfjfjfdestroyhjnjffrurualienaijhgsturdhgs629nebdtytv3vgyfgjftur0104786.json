She was very knowledgable and helpful throughout the entire process. The best part is she sold us exactly what my church needed well below the budget that I requested. There are so many projectors out there at a wide variety of price points that it was very difficult to find what we needed on our own. Carmen was able to narrow down our search by finding the projectors that would give us the best picture for our needs. She first asked information about how we were going to use the projector, and was able to match us up with the perfect fit based on the screen size, room size, throw distance, and room lighting. She was not pushy in any way and just gave me the information and let me make a decision without trying to \"up sell\" me on any unnecessary products. If you need a projector for any reason definitely call projector people first. The shipping is free and the prices seemed to be as low as I could find anywhere else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:49:00.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

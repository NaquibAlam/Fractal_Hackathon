That being said, there are many things they need to work on...one thing I really dislike about their service is the reports on how they are coming to these numbers for our payouts are very confusing to understand. I decided to finally sit down and try to figure these out and while I did not get a full understanding of the reports, I was able to find the fees we were being charged and found out we were charged over $2300 more than we were supposed to be (we should have only been charged around $1700).\nI am very glad I was able to find this out on my own because I do not think they would have brought it to my attention or noticed on their end and we would have continued to have been charged around double what we should have been.\nAll of that being said, once I got in contact with them they initially tried to make it sound like they were \"hidden fees\" which I was not happy about. I was persistent with it and made them dig deeper into it and once they realized that they were in the wrong, they did everything they could to make it right.\nAll of that taken into consideration, I have a few things that I do not like about their service such as the fees going unnoticed and also the fact that they are nearly impossible to reach by phone without having to leave a voice mail. I would say my success rate of talking to someone on the first call is around 10-15% which is very aggravating. I know you will be reading this payability so please fix that. Other than that, they really did try to bend over backward for me to help resolve my issue right away and for that I am happy with them. They are a growing company going through growing pains and have some work but I think they have a very bright future ahead of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:09:38.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I did have some questions regarding the product; i.e., confirmation of measurements for sizing as well as what items were specifically included in the package Your employee was so helpful and even pulled a stock item to be sure she had the specific answer to my questions. Then, upon placing my order, the product arrived in a very short time. .My 89-year-old Mom has experienced chronic leg edema for several years now. The compression hose (themselves) often cause skin tears: a) simply by the act of pulling them up b) the tightness and indentations caused by the stockings at various points on Mom's legs during fluid buildup c) and/or the friction the stockings cause when wearing daily - especially should Mom's legs swell. The ability to slightly ease the compression when Mom is having a fluid build-up in her legs is wonderful. Due to Parkinsons, Mom does not have the strength to either apply or remove the wraps, and the assisted living caregivers are so happy with the ease of application and removal. The liner is so lightweight and provides a wonderfully comfortable barrier before applying the banded wrap. It was my intention that Mom have the final say regarding comfort and the ability of the wraps to do the \"job\". Well, they are passing the test wonderfully. Mom says they feel so much better than regular hose and the compression (as adjusted per her cardiologist's recommendation) is keeping the fluid buildup in her legs at bay. We are so impressed with these and (although pricey) would recommend them to anyone with leg edema.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T13:11:48.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

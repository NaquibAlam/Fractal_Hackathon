I thought for sure that I was going to have to wait at least 2 weeks before I could resume taking care of my home. When I found the Vacuum - Direct website I was a little skeptical, so of course I did some research all of which came back favorable. I placed my order with them for the new hose and to my surprise it was at my door 2 days later. I will continue to use this company for any other parts that I may need in the future and I will spread the word to my friends and family as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T15:07:31.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

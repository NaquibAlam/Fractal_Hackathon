I booked a non-refundable hotel in Canada and completely spaced on the fact that I needed a passport. I had 2 weeks. RushMyPassport saved my vacation. Jason Austin was fantastic, I can't tell you how many times I exchanged emails with him, clarifying things, double checking things, and just generally worrying. I'd always get the FASTEST, most helpful responses. I got my passport about 5 days sooner than I was expecting, AND the passport card that I ordered came with it, even though I was told it may take an additional 3-4 weeks. You might think this service is costly, but trust me, it's worth twice what they're charging when you're in a bind like I was. My stress has melted away and I'm ready for vacation now!\nThank you RushMyPassport and thank you Jason!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T20:27:31.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There is lots of experienced and reliable sitters with great referencies, you are garanteed to find a sitter. I am very happy that my dog don't have to go to kennels and also it's lots cheaper to register and go away and use \"Trusted housitters\" as many times as you like! ( yearly membership fee-which is less then week in kennels) so it is win-win situation for everyone ;0)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T13:12:55.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

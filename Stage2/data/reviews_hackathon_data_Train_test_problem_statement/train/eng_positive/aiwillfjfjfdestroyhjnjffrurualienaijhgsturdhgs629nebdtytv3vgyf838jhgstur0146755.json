I called the coustomer service line excepting to get a recording prompting me to send an email to some help desk. But something amazing happened... A PERSON ANSWERED THE PHONE and proceeded to politely help me out. The gentleman on the phone was real cool too. He advised me that because of where I was getting my parts shipped to that I should save my money and not expedite shipping because my package would likely be here in the same time frame. I got the package the very NEXT DAY. I love this place already and will always look here first for civic parts.

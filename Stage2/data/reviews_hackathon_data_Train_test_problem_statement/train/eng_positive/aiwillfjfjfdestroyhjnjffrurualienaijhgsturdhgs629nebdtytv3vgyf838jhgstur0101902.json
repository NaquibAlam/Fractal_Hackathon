Unfortunately she passed away before the parcel arrived and we did not get the chance to use Endoca's products. Anyways I want to write down my experience with this online shop. The customer service is really helpful and they answered all the questions I've had. Due to the fact that we could not use the products for my mother, we had to return them. Even the returning process was absolutely easy and I got the money back within a few weeks.\nThanks for your absolutely great service Endoca!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:07:41.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

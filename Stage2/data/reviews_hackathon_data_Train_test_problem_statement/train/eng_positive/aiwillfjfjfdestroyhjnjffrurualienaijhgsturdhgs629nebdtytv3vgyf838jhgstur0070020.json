I purchased insurance away from their insurance, and was asked to have my credit card validated for a holding deposit (no problem, I understand).\nI asked if any money would be taken, as I have a Euro credit card that charge for any non-Euro transaction (so could have used another card), and I got a flat reply of \"it's a holding deposit\". I asked again, saying the above, and got exactly the same answer, but with a bit more anger.\nI then asked him if he knew what a \"holding deposit\" actually was, and he again said \"it's a holding deposit\". So rather than get embroiled in this idiotic conversation, I just went with it.\nOn another note, the gentlemen serving the other people was nice and friendly (although he did have a colleague who swore profusely and proceeded to throw paperwork out of the top window to a colleague downstairs, which is highly unprofessional in my opinion).\nBut overall, for the price (especially using the AXA insurance instead), was no problem. The car was thoroughly checked before and after (although be aware of the \"if you do not fill it up within 5 miles we will charge you 3 pound\" rule).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:10:15.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

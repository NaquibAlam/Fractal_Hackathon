Arranged the two hour slot as have a baby and toddler at home. Tony called me to check I was available and advised he was ten minutes away. He was very friendly and professional and explained what he was going to do and I was able to leave him to get on with the tyre replacement whilst I stayed in house with kids. When he had finished he talked through what he had done and only got me to sign once I confirmed I was content with the work. Really pleased with the service!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T10:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:05:59.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

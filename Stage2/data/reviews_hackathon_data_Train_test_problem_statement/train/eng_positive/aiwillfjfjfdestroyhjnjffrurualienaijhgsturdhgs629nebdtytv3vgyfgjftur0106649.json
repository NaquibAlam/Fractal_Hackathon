I found this to be particularily beneficial in the interactive navigation rule descriptions. There is no compariosn in studying right of way using animations vs just a book. The one weak spot would be the state specific rules (Chapter 9), this chapter is definitly a bit of an anti-climactic way to end after 8 chapters of well done interactions. In any case I do, whithout any reservations, recommend this package to anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:47:53.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

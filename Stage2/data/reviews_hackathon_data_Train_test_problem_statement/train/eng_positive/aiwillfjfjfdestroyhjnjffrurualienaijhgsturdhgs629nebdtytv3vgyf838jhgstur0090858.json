RL is a wonderful online marketplace for antiques. I give 4 stars and not 5 because I believe that improvements are seriously needed in Ruby Lane's email system, which is very inconvenient to use. The emailing system of any company is extremely important and should work efficiently. I have complained to RL about this before; they responded that they would look into the matter; but I am not sure if they have. Negative aspects of their email system are the following: RL allows buyers and sellers to email/correspond OUTSIDE of RL by way of the courtesy emails sent to the seller's and buyer's personal email accounts. When sellers and buyers email outside of RL, those emails are not recorded within the RL email system, which causes confusion. When members email each other outside of RL, members should automatically be directed to the RL site to sign in, and then they would be able to continue with their email correspondence within RL. I explained to RL when I complained about this problem to them that the solution that I have described is the way that ebay and Etsy are set up, and it works very well. Also, another bad thing about RL's emailing system is that when RL members email each other within RL, the emails do not appear in one thread. For example if a seller and I have emailed each other multiple times, those emails do not show in one email thread. The emails show up in fragments, that is, in different emails. This is very frustrating and confusing when I need to go back and review my emails with a seller for whatever reason. These flaws should have been fixed years ago.

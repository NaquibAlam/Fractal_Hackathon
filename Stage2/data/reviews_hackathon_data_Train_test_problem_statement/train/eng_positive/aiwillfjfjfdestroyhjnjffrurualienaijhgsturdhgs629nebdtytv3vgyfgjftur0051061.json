I found the values offered by EagleSaver to be higher than the others. When I had issues on my first order of not being able to find my item in their database, I contacted them and they walked me through the solution. This company is very easy to work with. Customer service is quick and eager to help. My payment was issued within one to two days of the company receiving my package. I have used it twice and will use it again. I highly recommend this site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T14:44:23.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Later on, I found that processing the package takes 3 more days. I was disappointed at first, but whe I contacted the support team, they were just great. They appologized for the misunderstanding, and even sent me the package with a faster carrier without extra cost, such that I received the package the exact day I was expecting. They even established a direct skype connection between me and a member of their support team to make sure that the issue is handled.\nI think this company is still new in this business as they should improve the website's user interface and logic. Nevertheless, they proved that they extremely care about their customers and reputation. Will be buying more stuff in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:32:49.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

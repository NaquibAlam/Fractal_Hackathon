From the customs pick up, English speaking drivers (for EVERY car trip), to the above and beyond service from each (cause if you come to Costa Rica, take their advice and go to multiple locations-it's worth it) location. My partner and I have very specific food allergies and was very impressed when every location had something to offer and even whole meal options! I know it's hard to trust someone to plan your entire vacation but take the time to just talk to a specialist (they work with and for YOU). I could go on and on about Pura Vida but I think you should just take our advice and go yourself! Shout out to Anastasia McCulloch for changing the way I vacation!! You are a life changer!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:28:55.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

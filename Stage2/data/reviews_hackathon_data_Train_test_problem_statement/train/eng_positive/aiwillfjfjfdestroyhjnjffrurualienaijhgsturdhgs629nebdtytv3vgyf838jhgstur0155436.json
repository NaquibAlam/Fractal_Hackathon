I used a custom template to design the growler, and shortly after submitting my order I received an email containing a mock-up for my approval. This step was unexpected but appreciated. It was great to know that Tempercraft is careful to provide exactly what the customer wants. My order arrived really quickly, and I am so impressed with the quality, size, and design. 64 oz is BIG, but somehow lighter than it looks. It looks good, feels good, and keeps my water ice cold. 5-star rating for the ordering process and product itself, I am super impressed.

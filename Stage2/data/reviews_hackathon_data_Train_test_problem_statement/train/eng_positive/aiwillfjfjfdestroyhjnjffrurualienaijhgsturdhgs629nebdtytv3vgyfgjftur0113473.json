More recently I found Diatomaceous Earth (DE) is both more comfortable and more antiparasitic than mebendazole as I took it. Even so this may work for others if they take more as they say with a doctor's advice. Mebendazole is antaparasitic and is for hookworms and it is indeed strong, but perhaps DE is better, don't know yet. Even so DE has a long history of safe and healthy use. There are A LOT of antiparasitic herbs and methods you can try, and while this is my own opinion I tend to like DE a bit more. Thanks to Kiwi for offering hope about this, it's been years in R and D for me, and I like the price, I like they sell mebendazole, as a option since it's also thought to be anticancer and most will have this too, they don't sell it here in the US.\nI got my first order in 3 weeks or so but the next two were in just 1 week, summertime in New Zealand must be great! They may send a box of heat to Ohio!\nThe site is beautiful and if they hadn't gotten my business, I would have been even more uncomfortable while waiting to buy the DE. Due to the value of the business and it's real mebendazole, I would recommend Kiwi in general for other options or mebendazole if e.g. you can't find better or for other valued products you know r real!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:29:47.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

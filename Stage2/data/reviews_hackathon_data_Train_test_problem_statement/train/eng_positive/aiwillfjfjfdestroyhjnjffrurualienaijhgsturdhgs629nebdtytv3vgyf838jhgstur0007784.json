For the most part my books come in the way they were described and fairly quickly. I find CSM world wide tracking sub-par but I haven't had a lost package yet. My biggest issue was ordering a lot of paperbacks at once that were sent all at once in a big thrift books bag. Because of the quantity of the books many were bent from most likely something heavy put on top. That was disappointing. I think those bags should be meant for larger books and something else should be used or at least labeled do not bend or stack. The awesome thing is the bags are able to be recycled and that's pretty awesome. To me I've found great deals delivered in good time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T04:58:12.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We explored a number of different properties and finally selected Pearl East in Turks & Caicos based upon their recommendation.\nTo say that we had an amazing time would be an understatement. Pearl East was the perfect property for our group – we enjoyed everything about it. The property itself was breathtaking – and the service that came with it pushed the whole experience over the top. Chef Josip delivered delicious, top-shelf meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day. One evening, the staff celebrated our birthdays by literally moving the dinner table to the beach where we dined under the stars next to the waves. We expected \"very good\" – and we received \"outstanding.\" Our butler, Ren, was extremely attentive – making each and every member of our 8-person group feel special and pampered. The property managers, Auriol and Delphine, were there to greet us and introduce us to the property and would stop by every day to make sure every detail was going great. Our activities were expertly planned and all went perfectly. And the weather was ideal.\nIn sum, we and every member of our party couldn’t be happier with our experience. The property and service we received was excellent. We look forward to partnering with Exceptional Villas again to plan our next amazing vacation experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T06:03:54.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

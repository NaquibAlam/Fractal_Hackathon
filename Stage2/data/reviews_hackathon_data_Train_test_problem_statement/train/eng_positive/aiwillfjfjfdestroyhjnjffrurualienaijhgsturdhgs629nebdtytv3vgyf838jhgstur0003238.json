The only problem was that the instructions were very vague. After calling a few times, I got it figured out. Per the other reviews, the bolts that attach the mounting plates to the Bike won't fit. The right bolts were simple to fix as I have a bucket of spare bolts from over the years. You must drill the back of the bags to bolt to the mounting plates. For the looks and durability, and the price, it is a good deal if you have patience and are handy with tools. Once the bags are on, they will be very hard to take off. I am going to fix this. When I replace my rear tire, I am going to run the bolts from inside the fender thru the bags. Then I can remove the nuts and remove the bags to wash the Bike. The bags do look good on my 2009 1200 Low. All and all I would buy them again as for the quality, you can not beat the price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T20:18:29.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

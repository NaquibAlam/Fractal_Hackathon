I have lived in Granada for 7 years. I don´t own a car but rent a few times a year and after trying various options, I have returned to Doyouspain.com. I usually change the Doyouspain search page to specify only Enterprise car rental as Dollar/Thrifty are not reliable nor friendly. Enterprise have 3 locations (2 in City, 1 Airport). Their cars are always in good condition and their prices, whilst not always the absolutely lowest, are highly-competitive especially as the difference is made up for with good service both from Do you Spain as the booking agent, and Enterprise as the car supplier. Book ahead as far as possible, and sign up for DYS´s emails.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T13:59:34.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

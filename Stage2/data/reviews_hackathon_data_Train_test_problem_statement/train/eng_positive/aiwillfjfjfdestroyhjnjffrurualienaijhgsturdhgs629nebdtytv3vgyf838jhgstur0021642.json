How can you rate tour leaders Mel and Franco. They are absolutely the most fabulous pair. The tour itself ran so smoothly and we do know there was so much going on behind the scenes to keep it so. The itinerary was varied and kept us interested from day to day. The hikes, the scenery, the people, so much to rave about. I doubt you would ever get a complaint. This is our first tour as such, as we usually hire a car and do it on our own This small group tour has changed our minds on travelling. It is brilliant to have it all done for you and all that is left is for you to ENJOY. Our group was great , everyone got along beautifully. The Wild Patagonia tour 27 days saw us come home with 6,500 photos. Truly amazing. Well done to all involved. I would not hesitate to recommend this tour to anyone, young or older!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T11:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T08:24:02.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

One minor problem, my flight arrived early at Rarotonga / Cook Islands and as result when we showed up at our resort, there wasn't anyone there to greet us. It is family operated and they open at 8:00 every morning so we ended up waiting awhile for them. Aside from that, my stay was very good. In Tahiti, I stayed at the Manava Hotel. It is a very nice property but access to things in the surrounding area is somewhat limited. They provide a shuttle to town but it runs only three times a day so it isn't all that convenient. Going anywhere else there are taxies available but they aren't that prevalent and/or accessible. Overall I would highly recommend Goway Travel for future trips. I worked with Emma Woodward to put this whole thing together and cannot say enough about her help and professionalism. As a result it made my trip most enjoyable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:26:37.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

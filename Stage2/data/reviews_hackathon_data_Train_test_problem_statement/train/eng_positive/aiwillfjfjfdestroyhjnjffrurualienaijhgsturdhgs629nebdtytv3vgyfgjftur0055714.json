However, one will notice that a lot of the negative reviews are not verified and that the positive ones are and that a lot of the negative ones are rather far fetched.\nI purchased a Citizen BJ8050-08E diver's watch and could not be more pleased with it; three months into my ownership I have had no issues and nothing but compliments from others. The order was processed within an hour, shipped on the day of purchase, and at my door within two days.\nJomashop made the process of ordering very easy with their website design and sent numerous emails to give order status updates and follow ups post-delivery. All in all, a very sophisticated, efficient, and gratifying experience that will make me a repeat customer in the future.\nNote: Due to the low price points offered by Jomashop, the factory warranty program will not be an option for products bought from them. However, Jomashop does offer it's own comparable policy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:16:38.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

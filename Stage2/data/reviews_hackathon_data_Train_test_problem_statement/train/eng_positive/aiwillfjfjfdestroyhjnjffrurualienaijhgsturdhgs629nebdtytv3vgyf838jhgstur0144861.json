Everyone at the facility was super nice, professional, and caring. We spoke to the surgeon on arrival in the morning. He explained the procedure in detail, answering all our questions, giving us all the time necessary to ensure we were confident in what was about to happen. The follow-up calls and visit were handled in a professional and friendly manner. I would highly recommend this facility to anyone needs specialty treatment for their pet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T10:34:41.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

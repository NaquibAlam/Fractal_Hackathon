From the start the objective of the staff was clearly for the trip to be as good as they could make it- example, the whole order of the cruise was reversed on departure from Ushuaia because of bad weather in the Falklands, so instead of starting in the Falklands and ending up in Antarctica, we went the other way round. The local knowledge of the ship captain and Jonathan, the expedition director, meant that during the whole trip there was only 1 landing that we were unable to execute (which seems to be almost unheard of in the region.) Every day there would be 2 landings, 3 on one day, and these were carried out efficiently and safely. No waiting around to get on the zodiacs.The knowledge and enthusiasm of the various expedition crew members was amazing. We could not fault the trip in any way, and can happily say that it exceeded our expectations in all respects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:08:20.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

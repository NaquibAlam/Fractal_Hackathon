It's a great Spa you can spend the time swimming against the jets to help out with the cardiovascular or the fitness which my wife luvs or you can seat back and enjoy the bubbles which seem to spend a lot of time enjoying lol. Would give it a 5 out of 5.\nRegrets should have brought the dual swim spa so we could run the swim area cooler and keep the spa seats nice and hot.

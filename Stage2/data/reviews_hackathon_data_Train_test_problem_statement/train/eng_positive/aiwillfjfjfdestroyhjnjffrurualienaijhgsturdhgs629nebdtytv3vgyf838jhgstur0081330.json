My problem was so complicated that I am currently in my 3rd Year. Were it not for the extremely professional service and initiative taken by Lila Sandgren and her immediate staff none of my problems would have been solved. During this laborious negotiation, Lila uncovered some errors made by IRS in my records which were vital to my bottom line. At every step of the way she has been deliberate, consistent, and involved to allow me the best benefit. She is kind, and, firm in what is expected of me as a client and I respect her judgment and trust her implicitly. Overall, I could not have had better representation in any firm and I am fortunate to have her on my case. She is a valuable asset who is endowed with a consummate appreciation of the tax laws and after this experience with her attention to detail, I would not be comfortable with anyone else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T18:41:14.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

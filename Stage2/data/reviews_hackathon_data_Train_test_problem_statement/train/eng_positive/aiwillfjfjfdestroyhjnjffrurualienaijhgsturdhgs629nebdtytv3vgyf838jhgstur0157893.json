The books are VERY reasonably priced and if you purchase only 3 books, you get free shipping. Fast, free shipping at that!! I have never gotten a book I was dissatisfied with. There are so many titles to chose from I can always find something I would like to read. This has become my \"go to\" place when I need a book to read.

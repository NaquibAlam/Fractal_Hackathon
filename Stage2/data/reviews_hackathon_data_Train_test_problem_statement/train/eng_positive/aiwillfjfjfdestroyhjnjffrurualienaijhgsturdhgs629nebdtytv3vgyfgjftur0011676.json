When it arrived and I put it on I was SO excited to discover it looked almost as good on me as it did on the models. I LOVE it! It's stunning. Looks just as great as it does in all your beautiful pics. And it is SO flattering. AI was actually concerned it would flatten my chest, but it's not flattening at all, it's really well shaped. And the best part of the whole experience was the attentive, detailed and helpful service I received from Beach Life. Every pre purchase question was responded to promptly, with lots of relevant detail, and always in a delightfully friendly way. Additionally I had referenced the fact that I was hopeful it would arrive before the weekend, but given where I live, I wasn't hopeful. Can you imagine my delight when I received an email from Beach Life advising my postage had been upgraded to Express?! Even with a public holiday between my order and the weekend, it arrived Friday morning ready for a weekend beach trip. Next time I need to buy a swimsuit, I know where I'll be going!

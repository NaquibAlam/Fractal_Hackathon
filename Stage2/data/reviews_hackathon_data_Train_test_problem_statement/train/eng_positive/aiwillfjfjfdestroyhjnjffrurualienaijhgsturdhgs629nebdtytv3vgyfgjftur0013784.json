I found them when I searched for a Ted Baker dress on-line because it was out of stock in the major department stores. I decided to 'take a gamble' on a company I had never heard of before and was pleased I did! The dress was dispatched that afternoon (Thursday) and arrived on the Saturday with free delivery. I was very impressed. Free returns too. I will use again in the future.

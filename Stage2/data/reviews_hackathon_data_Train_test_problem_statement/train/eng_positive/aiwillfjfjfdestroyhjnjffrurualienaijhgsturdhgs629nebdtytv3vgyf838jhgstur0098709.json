However, the booking process was so simple. Alister was my agent. I was very picky on my times and flights. He never gave up on me and worked with me, sending me flights until there was a combination that worked for me at an amazing price! Even after I paid he still didn't disappear. He was right there available to answer all my questions by email or phone call. Very prompt response. So far so good and I'm very happy with the customer service.

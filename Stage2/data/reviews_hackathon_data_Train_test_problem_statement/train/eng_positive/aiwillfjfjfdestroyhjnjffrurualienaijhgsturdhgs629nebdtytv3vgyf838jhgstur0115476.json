(High waist leggings with zippers up the sides) the leggings fit like a glove! The shirt was amazing as well!\nOnly down side, not a whole lot of items left in 3x.. now i know not a lot of big girls such as myself work out, but when we do we want to look as good as everyone else!\nI had a member credit that i was looking forward to using until i got on the site. It took 6 outfits before I could find one that worked size wise.\nAlso, i wish you could mix and match. Not be confined to the outfit that you put together.\nWell thanks for listening and hope to see more plus size stuff cuz i don't want to stop shopping with you!\nðŸ˜‰", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:51:56.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The design is made really professionally by people who really understand the product and people needs.\nPricing is very reasonable for the set. The car seat has locking/fixation indicator - helps a lot. Easy to \"plug\". Stroller is really comfortable in a way that you can switch facing side. Aluminium made body frame.\nTo summarize - the overall quality and design is very good.\nI would highly recommend their product as a complete set for newborn.\nPersonally want to thank you also for doing such product. Great work, keep up.\nA suggestion would be for you to publish more pictures/videos so people will see all they need to know, the videos you had are not comprehensive.\nPS:\nThe company really does not do marketing, but it is probably one of the real companies who focus on product rather then rubbish marketing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T16:25:01.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

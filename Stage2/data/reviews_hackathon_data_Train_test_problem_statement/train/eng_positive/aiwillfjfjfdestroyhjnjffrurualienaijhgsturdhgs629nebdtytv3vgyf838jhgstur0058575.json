Having never used kennels or dog minders before, I was a bit apprehensive. Brad, completely put my mind at ease. Superb, professional, friendly service. Keisha enjoyed her stay with her host and we were kept up to date over the weekend with messages and even a video in her hosts home. So glad we have found someone to care for our dog when we are away.

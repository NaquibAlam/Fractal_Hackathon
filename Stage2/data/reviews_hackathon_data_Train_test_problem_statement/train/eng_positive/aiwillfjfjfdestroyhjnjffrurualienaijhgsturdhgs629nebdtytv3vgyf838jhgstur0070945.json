The ultra wide field of view, it actually makes you feel like its daylight. You can see everything so clearly. And the spot beam, is so bright, you can see everything too. You can see a cat at 100 yards. The rechargeable batteries is the main reason I bought it and it sure saves on batteries in the long run, and very convenient and easy to charge. Love the product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T09:46:26.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

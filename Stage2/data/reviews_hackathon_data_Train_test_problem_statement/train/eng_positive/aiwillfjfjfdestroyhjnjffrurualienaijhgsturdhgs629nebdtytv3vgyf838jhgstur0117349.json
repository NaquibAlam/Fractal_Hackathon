While web searching for a replacement lock/key set, I discovered EasyKeys.com. I had no idea I could order replacement keys. I was able to determine the exact keys I needed without talking to customer service. Yes, just by navigating the website. My keys arrived within the time frame Quote: d (within 5 days).

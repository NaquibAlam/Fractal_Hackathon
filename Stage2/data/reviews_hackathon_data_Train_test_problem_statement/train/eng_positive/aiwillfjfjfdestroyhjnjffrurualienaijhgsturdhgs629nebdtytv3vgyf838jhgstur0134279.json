It was easy to install. I used a tap to clean out the existing threaded holes in the frame. Held the hitch up and installed the 4 bolts that hold it in place. I used blue medium strength Loctite and torqued bolts to the supplied spec. Watch a Youtube video if you have any problems. The Tekonsha trailer wiring adapter also installed very easily. I added an RV style 7 terminal plug, I found a convenient existing body grommet to feed the wire through. Double checked power with a test light. Awsome install. OEM cost of hitch and light connector was over $1200 if I installed, over $1600 if the Stealership did the install. Total cost from Hitchweb about $300 including getting a piece of 7 conductor wire from Princess Auto to connect between wiring adapter and 7 way plug.\nHitchweb has awesome customer service. Highly recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:17:14.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

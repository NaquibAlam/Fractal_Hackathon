If there had been more, I probably would have found another way. As it was, I went ahead and took a chance. Everything came very quickly and the entire order was shipped together. Prices were better with Brushy Mountain and they had everything I wanted instead of having to piecemeal it together with other companies. I hope that Brushy Mountain can fix the issues they have so that people will be more confident buying from them in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T10:33:20.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Looking for tours by local guides led me to ToursByLocals. I was put in touch with different guides which I could choose from. After reading reviews I chose Henry G. which was probably one of the best choices I have ever made. It was easy. Months before we were due to leave I emailed him our itinerary and he got right back to me with prices, choices and suggestions. I could tell from his quick and polite responses, which there were many due to all the questions I had that Henry was the one to be with us thru our 7 day private tour of Costa Rica. At that point ToursByLocals contacted me and generated the contract and worked out the deposit and full payment schedule. It was simple and the cost was very reasonable for the amount of time and traveling we spent with Henry. May I add Henry brings a driver which allowed him to concentrate on the 4 of us and all of our questions. Josue, our driver was extremely professional and stayed focused on driving as safely as possible. We all enjoyed the days together, lunch and most dinners. I know we would have not been able to do or see what we had done without them. It was hard to say bye to Henry and Josue at the end but we have great memories, pictures and 2 new friends. Thanks to ToursByLocals for connecting us with them. When we travel in May and June this year to Europe, we will be choosing our guides using ToursByLocals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T03:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T08:46:54.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

My reservation still wasn't showing in the Hotel's system after three days. I contacted Amoma customer service, and received an email within an hour that the hotel now had the reservation, which I called and verified with the hotel. I presented the voucher at the time of check-in and the desk clerk confirmed that all charges had already been billed and that I wouldn't have any additional charges unless I ordered room service or ran a tab at the hotel bar. It has been five days since I returned home, and no other charges have appeared on my credit card. The only other negative is that I received multitudes of emails from AMOMA before the trip trying to interest me in car rentals and other services or attractions in the city I was traveling to. Overall it worked out well, and I probably would book through the site again since it was significantly cheaper than prices other booking sites were offering, but I would definitely use a credit card and not go through Paypal. That way you have an avenue to dispute charges. Also I would verify the booking well in advance with the facility so that any issues could be rectified before arrival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:28:17.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

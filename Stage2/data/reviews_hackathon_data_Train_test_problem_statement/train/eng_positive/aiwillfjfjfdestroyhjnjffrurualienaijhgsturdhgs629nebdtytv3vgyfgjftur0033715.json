I LOVE these boots. I am a busy engineer on boats and didn't have time to give them a proper break-in period before wearing them all day, every work day. My feet haven't complained a bit.\nBeing female, I have \"small\" feet when it comes to finding steel toed work boots (womens US7.5), but by working with their supplier, Simply Australian were able to find a pair of tiny boots for my tiny feet anyways! They were even going to have a representative within the Rossi Boots company personally fly over with a pair on their next trip over if it came to it (thankfully, it didn't). Wonderful people, wonderful company. I'll be telling all my friends checking out my sick new boots where they can get their pair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:22:03.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

And also the company's response to my original review.\nThey collect a lot of personal info, including phone number. Many pages and clicks to create an account and make a purchase. ID verification code sent to my phone was a bit much.\n**IMMEDIATELY after I submitted my information (with phone number), I received a SPAM phone call from an out of state area code. Coincidence?\nEDIT: Thank you for the response below. I believe the spam call was a coincidence. Being an international company explains the lengthy purchasing process a bit more, especially since it was my first one and I had to create an account. I'll be changing my 2 start review to a 4 star review. I'll be emailing support about a reddit thread with other's opinions on the process.\nAgain, thank you for the response and explanation. Good customer service goes a long way to return business. Now that I have an account with you it's likely I'll make future purchases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T17:59:38.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It’s the best thing since sliced bread. I have been receiving Hello Fresh since the first of the year and have not received a meal that my husband and I haven’t thought was extraordinary. The meats and vegetables are always fresh and delicious; the recipes are simple and easy to follow. Everything you need for each meal is included except a little olive oil or butter. We are saving money by not going to the grocery and purchasing things we don’t need or purchasing expensive ingredients which we would use once and end up eventually throwing away. The best thing is you don’t have to decide, “Hmm, what am I going to fix for dinner tonight?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T23:02:34.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

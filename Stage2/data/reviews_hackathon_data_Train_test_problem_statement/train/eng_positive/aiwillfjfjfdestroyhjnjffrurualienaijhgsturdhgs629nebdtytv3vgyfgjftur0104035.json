I took a leap of faith based on the excellent construction design explained on the website and the awesome customer service representatives that answered all my questions. I started with a Queen mattress and foundation about a year ago and have now replaced 3 mattresses in our house with Saatva. Nothing to lose, if you don't like it they will take it back, I doubt they get many returns! Oh and the price is less than half of what I was going to pay at a mattress store.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:57:54.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Hsiu Hsiu from Nelson Alexander, Kew has made the whole experience a lot easier and most importantly, gave me the confidence that she was the right agent for my property. My first consultation with Hsiu was very professional, she asked me a lot of questions, trying to understand my expectations as well providing me the knowledge I need as this was my first time selling my property. It was an easy decision to use Hsiu as my agent and didn't think there was any need to consult any other agents. Through the process, Hsiu gave me many follow up phone calls, arranging all the required tasks to ensure the property will be ready in the market as scheduled and provides me an update after every opening. Her professionalism and personalised service has really went beyond my expectations. Hsiu also engaged Mark to assist with the auction, who did a fantastic job. Mark was understanding and provided me a quick briefing before the auction and once again, gave me the confidence they knew their job perfectly. Both Hsiu and Mark have delivered an exceptional service, not only achieving a great outcome and I felt was their only customer from the beginning of the sale process to the end. Weldone, great team-", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:13:36.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

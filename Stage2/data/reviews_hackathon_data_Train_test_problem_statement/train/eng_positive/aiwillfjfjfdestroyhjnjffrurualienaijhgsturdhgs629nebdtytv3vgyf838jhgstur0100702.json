Price so low? How could that be? Well, I read over previous reviews and thought to give it a try. At first, it took awhile awhile to get my prescription approved but once that happened, shipping was fairly quick. I received my contacts (ordered 16 boxes, I think) and they were packaged very well. I had to try them on right away and it was very exciting. I reached out to Kathryn and thanked her for comforting my worrisome. The staff is incredible and I will be buying more from them! So thank you, LensDirect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:17:30.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

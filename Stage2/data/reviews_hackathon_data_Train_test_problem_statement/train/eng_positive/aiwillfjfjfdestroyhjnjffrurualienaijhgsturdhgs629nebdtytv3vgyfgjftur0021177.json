When I first got to know TopVintage a few years ago, they openend my eyes to seeing how I could wear all these vintage inspired clothes and slowly build up my personal style towards the 40s and 50s -I have had a love for the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s ever since I was a little girl.\nI am a student teacher and feel most comfortable in front of the class when I dress like the 40s or 50s. The kids love it too. Especially the young ones are adorable when expressing feelings about my style -one boy said he couldn't believe I wasn't a real teacher yet, because I so looked like one. And that's exactly how I feel hihi\nOther excellent things about TopVintage: not only do they sell my favourite brands, free delivery and excellent customer service - I truly feel pampered every time my package from TopVintage arrives. You can just feel the love and care TopVintage has put into each aspect.\nI also love the models they use for the clothing n_n Vanessa Frankenstein, Miss Victory Violet, Ava Elderwood, Idda van Munster (well she's technically the model for Woody Ellen of course) -these are such inspiring women and they some how give me strength in pursuing my own style.\nI must say it's hard for me to resit buying anything Vanessa Frankenstein is wearing because she looks amazing in anything you guys throw on her!\nMy all time favourite purchase from TopVintage is the Collectif Clothing Vintage Anoushka Princess Coat & Cape.\nOrdered my perfect mint bridesmaid dress for my best friend's wedding at TopVintage\nThe skirt covered with bunnies, deer, squirrels and flowers that all kids and teachers love at my teaching practice school, and always leads to good conversation\nBirthday presents from my dad always come in my favourite pink and purple package\nTopVintage thank you for everything!\nLots of love,\nHannah", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T19:49:52.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

As parents we want the best and we tried other schools but my daughter was not in their interest academically.\nHere at Enlighthened they care and have cared. Her assigned counselor is and has been amazing...working with me as a parent and helping my daughter gain the education she needs to meet her goals. My daughter's teachers were always responded to emails promptly and gave her assistance in what she needed.\nI recommend this school over and over again.\nThank you Enlighthened!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:24:32.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The personal service is sensitively tailored to my preferences. There is absolutely no sense that we have to fit their preconceptions. The team give excellent advice and then leave the decisions to us. On this last trip (Myanmar) I was slightly less prescriptive than usual and yet the ideas that came from the company suited us perfectly. I really see the value of building up a relationship. It was clear that the people on the ground who gave excellent support had been fully briefed on our preferences too.

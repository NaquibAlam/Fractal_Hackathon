After reading some reviews online I found this discount website!! I had no hesitation at buying the product after seeing the MASSIVE discount. As soon as I confirmed my purchase of the BBG bundle i immediately recieved the email with the links to download the ebooks. I've printed them off and put them into a binder and from what i've read through it seems great. I love that every day for the whole 12 week program there is a clear guide of the exercises you need to do! Its very well put together and easy to follow! I can't wait to get started! I used to just go in the gym with no confidence and hide on the cardio machines. So havin this step-by-step guide is going to help me so much as there is so much variety to the workouts!! And only 28 minutes too!! Its seems great and I cant wait to get started!! Thanks for the discount - lets hope I make it to week 24!!!! üëç", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T14:16:19.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

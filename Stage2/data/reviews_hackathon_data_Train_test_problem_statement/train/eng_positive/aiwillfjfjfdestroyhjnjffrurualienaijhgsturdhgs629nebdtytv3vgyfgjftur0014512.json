I tried last year and she would not do it and the dress she finally got cost me over $400.00. This year, I finally talked her into looking online and we ordered from PromGirl. The dress came in within two days and my daughter was 100% pleased with the dress and this is not easy to do. Her dress is beautiful and cost half as much as I paid for a dress at a local dress shop last year. That make two happy customers from one order!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T03:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:05:59.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

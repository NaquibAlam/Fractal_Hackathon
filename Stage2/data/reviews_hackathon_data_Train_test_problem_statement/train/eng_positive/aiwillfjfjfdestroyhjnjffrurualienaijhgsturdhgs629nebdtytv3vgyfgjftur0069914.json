I got 3 pieces of gear out of it though I think I forgot to loot one boss. The DPS and healing were amazing and they obviously knew the mechanics of the instance quite well. I had a quest for some shards that I wasn't able to complete and trying to go back in to retrieve those items is impossible solo because they are behind a lot of elite mobs. It was my first time in here so I was watching the videos after boss fights and would come out and everyone was gone. It was tough trying to keep up. It would be nice to be in a voice chat with these guys so you can communicate with them. Everything is happening so fast, its tough to type and keep up. I haven't played this game for 6 years and it was nice coming back and grabbing a couple pieces of gear. Kara is an instance similar to the old one that I remember but definitely updated. Thanks for the great run guys!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T21:10:39.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

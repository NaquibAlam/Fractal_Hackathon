From start to end, it felt like I had a personal assistant helping me in this process. She really knows her stuff; all about the sapphires, cuts, settings, ring sizes, materials, etc.\nIt was a real joy and pleasure dealing with Caitlyn through this whole process/experience. She was patient with any queries and apprehensions of mine, helped me to come up with alternatives and provide her feedback and suggestions, and ultimately helped us to arrive at our ideal engagement ring.\nThe ring was even nicer than we expected, from all the pictures and renderings we were provided to gauge and ascertain the final look of the ring. The box is nothing short of awesome, super nicely done and very solid. And the ring is just beautiful. Very well made, with an extremely beautiful sapphire in the exact kind of colour/hue we wanted all along.\nThanks to The Natural Sapphire Company and Caitlyn for an amazing experience and helping us to create a wonderful custom sapphire engagement ring!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:20:40.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

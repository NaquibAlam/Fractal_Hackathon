We were getting really bad snowstorms through Idaho, so I didn't think they would get here until after new years. I was wrong. They got here before new year's. Plus they gave me free shipping and no sales tax. After I got all my books, they then had a coupon for $15 off my next order.\nSo the downside is that most of their books are used. You can get new or like new on some titles. And you never know. Some books I have from them are barely used. At $3.79-3.95 a book, you can't compete with that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:02:24.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

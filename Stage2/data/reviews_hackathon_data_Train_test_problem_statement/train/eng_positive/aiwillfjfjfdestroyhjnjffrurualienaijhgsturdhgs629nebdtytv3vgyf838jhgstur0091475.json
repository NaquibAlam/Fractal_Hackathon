One does something and the other does it within the next couple weeks. I prefer to drive for Lyft, and most of the other drivers do as well. We make more money and tipping is in the app. The biggest issue is the length of time it takes to get to the rider. That being said, to make the cost just as cheap as Uber is stupid. I won't drive over 20 minutes to get a rider. I personally have found there is a difference between Lyft riders and Uber riders. Lyft is like Macy's and Uber is like the dollar store. The mentality of the Uber passenger is very disrespectful to me and the vehicle. I would strictly drive for Lyft but right now the ratio isn't there.\nI say, grow some cahoonas please", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:07:10.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
